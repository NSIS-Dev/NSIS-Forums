I mean, it seems there isn't too many people interested on L-NSIS so why to waste my spare-time on documenting it's features... (If I see there's more people confused on it's use I'll try to write a better documentation).<br><br>Explanation:<br><br>In NSIS scripting language there is a "SubCaption Page subcaption" command, where Page is any number between 0 and 4. SubCaption0 to SubCaption4 SetText's parameters are their equivalents at run-time.<br><br>Example:<br><br>At compile-time-----------------&gt;At run-time<br>-----------------------------------------------------<br>SubCaption 0 "Something"--------&gt;SetText SubCaption0 "Something"<br>SubCaption 4 "Like a bird"------&gt;SetText SubCaption4 "Like a bird"<br><br>For more info on SubCaption see makensis.htm.<br><br>Did you know there is a new L-NSIS version (1.67.2)?<br>Go to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis/" target="_blank">www.geocities.com/rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis/</a> and download from there.<br>With this new version you can get a lot of bug-fixes, new features like more commands (LoadLicenseData and SetSectionName ) and improvements.<br><br>Sorry for my english.<br><br>P.S.: thanks for asking, now I know there is someone but me using L-NSIS.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">DuaneJeffers</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th December 2001 02:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">To upload it to the NSIS Project House Repository, you must have a SourceForge Account, then I would add you to the project.
