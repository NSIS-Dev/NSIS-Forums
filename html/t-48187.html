      <p class="post-content"><strong>That's easy</strong><br />
      Some (many) authors may not wish you to know their "secrets", but it's a very simple step to include the .nsi file into the compiled .exe. I've been doing it for months with a project I've been working on. It allows me to make subtle changes to the locations and version numbers w/o having to redo everything all the time. If break something, I just use the last version's installer, and I'm back to where I was before I messed up.<br />
      <br />
      So what I'm saying is, instead of Justin having to code a way to get the script back from a binary .exe, you (or anyone) can just include it in whatever you are working with (it was my plan from the start to get rid of the .nsi when I left beta, but maybe I'll keep it around {just for you :} ).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I guess...<br />
      <br />
      Before I discovered NSIS I had been using <a href="http://www.innosetup.com/" target="_blank">Inno Setup</a>, and I had been installing the script as a hidden file, just in case I needed to modify something...but I saw a program that could extract the script from Inno Setup installers, so I thought, hey, why not. :)</p>
