      <p class="post-content">*sob* I had just modified my .nsi to match the changes since a7, and it changes again :/ Oh, well, I suppose the changes were needed.<br />
      Anyway, here's a french translation (remove the .txt thing, vBulletin forces me to add this).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh, and btw, here's is another little patch.<br />
      It fixes one macro in your english.nsh ("Back &gt; " becomes "&lt; Back" :), and polishes the french.nlf file (in french, you have a space before some punctuation signs like ":","?","!",";", and you need to accentuate uppercase letters). It removes some errors too ("symbôles" becomes "symboles" and "Execution" becomes "Exécution").<br />
      <br />
      ps: I forgot to modify the header of french.nsh with personal info. So: Sébastien Delahaye &lt;seb@delahaye.net&gt;.</p>

      The French Modern UI Text on the bottom of License dialog doesn't fit in the text area. Can you make it smaller or should I make the text area larger?<br />
      <br />
      <b>Update</b><br />
      Updated the multilanguage system a bit, it now uses defines instead of macro's, so adding new languages is even easier.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think you should make the text area a bit larger, I had many such problems translating for the "main" nsis language files...<br />
      <br />
      I've started working on the Greek language file for modern ui. BTW, my nighly build didn't have a Contrib\Modern UI dir, so I had to get them form the cvs... I think it was nightly build updated Tue, 08 Oct 2002, 07:44:09 GMT.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, I've finished the Greek language file. Any feedback is welcome!<br />
      <br />
      A few comments about modern ui:<br />
      <br />
      - The "Required Space" text area should be larger (just a bit), as in NSIS default (for example, with the greek language file, when displaying 650.0KB doesn't fit completely).<br />
      - In the Uninstaller, the "Uninstall from" text area should be smaller, or have a seperate string in the modern ui language (for the default NSIS a shotened version of the appropriate string is used because the label is smaller, and it looks ugly with the modern ui because there's plenty of space)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, the modern ui looks very sweet! Perhaps you should drop the default ui of nsis and use this one! :)<br />
      <br />
      (off topic: a nsis for linux would be really cool - even a "light" version ;) Perhaps Nullsoft should consider changing nsis to use wasabi or .NET or something so that it becomes multiplatform?)</p>

      it is better than the one from cvs, examples: the accept button label doesn't match the translation in German.nlf and the installer advises the user to move the mouse (not the mouse pointer) over the components<br />
      <br />
      however, this is not an update to the one in cvs, I was slower than the other translator because I atually tested the translation with an installer and ran into the bugs described above<br />
      I don't like some of the translations in German.nlf also, so I'll probably update German.nlf and German.nsh later</p>

      Fixed the info text at the "select folder" page (the last word was at the fifth line, and wasn't displayed). If you can make the text area a bit bigger, I suggest you keep the older tranlsation because it's better. If you can't, use this one.<br />

      Dear Matini,<br />
      <br />
      In NLF, It would be more better to add a hotkey on "buttons". Such as<br />
      <br />
      LangString MUI_BUTTONTEXT_BACK ${LANG_TRADCHINESE} "&lt; ¤W¤@¨B(&amp;P)"<br />
      LangString MUI_BUTTONTEXT_NEXT ${LANG_TRADCHINESE} "¤U¤@¨B(&amp;N) &gt;"<br />
      LangString MUI_BUTTONTEXT_CANCEL ${LANG_TRADCHINESE} "¨ú®ø(&amp;C)"<br />
      LangString MUI_BUTTONTEXT_INSTALL ${LANG_TRADCHINESE} "¦w¸Ë(&amp;I)"<br />
      <br />
      Hotkeys not appeared on English version, but I think to add a hotkey will make the same UI style feeling (Eastern Asia) comparing with Wise &amp; Installshield.</p>

      </blockquote>NO. Not based on MS standard thinking, but think that hotkeys based on user handful and convenience thinking. If want example, Installshield old style (ex: Netscape 4.80 installer), Installshield 6.x new style (ex: Macromedia Flash MX), Enchalon installer (ex: Teleport Pro 1.29), Wise (ex: FlashGet 1.31), also supported Next, Back ...hotkeys.<br />
      <br />
      And, Microsoft Direct X 8.1 installer (English version) also support hotkeys?<br />
      <br />
      And, I would like hotkeys rather than a mouse click.<br />
      <br />
      Would we think it under user convenience?

      <br />
      I have see a few metioned replay about the button size. And if added hotkey, to prevent non-English button text truncated, some button need to resize (especially happend on Korean and SimpChinese). Follows is my suggest.<br />
      <br />
      Dialog 103, id 1001, enlage to 62x14<br />

      Dialog 106, id 1027, enlarge to 68x14<br />
      <br />
      In my experience, the UI size (including button) needs most is : Korean &gt;SimpChinese &gt; Japanese &gt; TradChinese &gt; Other languages. Button listed here I have tested is enough fit the text (even added hotkeys)

      </blockquote>OK, in CHT (Traditional Chinese) use a proprotional font "PMingLiU", in CHS (Simplified Chinese) use a fixed-width font "SimSun". So CHS need more width button than original. Something no problem at all in ENU and CHT, but almost truncated and too tight in CHS.<br />

      <br />
      I know in English original has no "&gt;" "&lt;" sign here (new English NSH has), but other installer (installshield6) version has it (incl. English and Chinese version)<br />

      <p class="post-content">&gt;The problem is that larger buttons add useles space to all other languages.<br />
      <br />
      I understand. Try for a "one size fits all" is really a hardwork.<br />
      <br />
      We can think this is the different: Western (ENU/DEU...) often use a font size "8" for a standard, but CHS/CHT/KOR/JPN 4 languages use font size "9". Western use "MS Sans Serif" as a dialog standard font, but CHS/CHT/KOR/JPN standard font is highly quitely different.<br />
      <br />
      &gt;I haven't got these Chinese fonts<br />
      <br />
      If using Win2k ENU version, try "Control panel/Regional Setting/System language setting", and check the checkbox of Chinese/Korean/Japanese ^_^ You can display Chinese or Korean in win2k, even with win2k English version.<br />
      <br />
      &gt;(try to make 'em a bit smaller).<br />
      <br />
      I am also afraid button-text truncated in button .<br />

      <br />
      Standard font for CHS is "SimSun" , which is a fixed-width font. That means if there button contains english charactor, would occupied fixed-width size. But for CHT/KOR/JPN is proportional font (yes, not fixed-width). Theoratically CHS is the languate which most easily truncated the button<br />
      <br />
      I also tested in CHS, the size will have NO truncated button. ^_^

      <br />
      You should remove the 'Click ... to continue' parts from the other strings, they are separate now.<br />
      <br />
      Have look at your screenshot. There is 'Click next to continue' twice :D<br />
      <br />
      I can remove that, but you should also update MUI_INNERTEXT_DIRECTORY_TOP.<br />
      <br />
      That space is for the install-type selection btw.

      I inserted a linebreak in 'Installations-\r\Assistenten' on the welcome dialog, can you make nsis automatically linebreak on '-'?<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure about 'Wizard'='Installations-Assistent', can any 'German windows &gt; 98' user confirm this?<br />
      <br />
      I don't like the 'Show Readme' text, sometimes those files have different names eg. makensis.htm or localized names (liesmich)<br />
      everyone who has used computers for a while knows what 'readme' means, newbies may not<br />
      non-English speaking people don't understand the self-referential meaning of 'readme' at all<br />
      I refuse to write 'Liesmich anzeigen': BAD style, it may eventually make sense as a filename but not as an checkbox option<br />
      also the content of a readme is nowhere defined (unlike eg. a file_id.diz), it could be everything<br />
      I suggest 'Show product information' ('Produktinformationen anzeigen')</p>

      <p class="post-content">The welcome page uses Install Options, so you should use \r\n for linebreaks.<br />

      The 'Show Readme' text can be customized by the user. For the default text, I think 'Show Readme' is ok.<br />

      <p class="post-content">thanks kichik, I didn't know that page<br />
      so 'setup wizard = Installations-Assistent' is correct<br />
      <br />
      Joost please update the linebreak in the language file I attached in my last post and upload it<br />
      the text will be 'Readme anzeigen' for now</p>

      <blockquote>
        A Readme is not just product installation.
      </blockquote>product information<br />
      <br />
      in the past a readme contained last minute information that didn't make it into the printed manual, nowadays (www age) it can contain the whole manual, quick usage tips, the version history or whatever the autor feels like - you can't even call it important information because I've seen too many readmes that weren't at all important :)

      <p class="post-content">'Fertigstellen' is correct but wrong here<br />
      <br />
      fertigstellen means that you have to click that button to complete the setup, but it already is complete at that point<br />
      the only thing that the button does is closing the dialog<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the link to the MS page.<br />
      <br />
      Well, "Beenden" would not be correct in all cases, either.<br />
      "Beenden" would not be the right choice if the user would have to reboot the machine in order to finish the installation.<br />
      <br />
      So: Please make it "Beenden" if installation is really complete and "Fertig stellen" if the user has to reboot. And don't forget to do this for all languages ;-)</p>

      <p class="post-content">uhg, that depends on how you define wizard<br />
      if wizard is an appilication it's wrong<br />
      if wizard is a step-by-step process it's ok<br />
      <br />
      I've found a pic that shows that the German translation of windows xp also treats 'Assistent' as a process (previous windows versions didn't), that would be:<br />
      <br />
      "Der ${MUI_PRODUCT} Installations-\r\nAssistent wird abgeschlossen." as title and "Abschliessen des Assistenten" as window title<br />
      <br />
      I still recommend my previous suggestion though, because an 'Assistent' is a person who helps and supports you<br />
      so that assistant has to be an actor (program) and cannot be a process<br />
      <br />
      but choose whatever you want</p>

      I have added a new MUI_TEXT_FINISH_INFO_TITLE string for the title of the finish-page, because it's better to use a different translation (the user has to click on the Finish button to finish the wizard).<br />

      BTW, when using the Modern UI the default font is MS Sans Serif while the default font for the default interface is Tahoma, although both have the MS Shell Dlg as font at the resources. How can that happen? I'm using XP.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Brazilian Portuguese Translation for Modern UI 1.62.</strong><br />
      Some fixes. PortugueseBR.nsh fixes:<br />
      <br />
      - Renamed the language name "Brazilian Potuguese" to "Português (do Brasil)". Joost, you can change in file "MultiLanguage.nsi", strings that are named "Portuguese (Brasil)" to this new name.<br />
      <br />
      - Added this line: !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGEFILE_STRING MUI_UNTEXT_CONTINUE_UNINSTALL "Clique em Desinstalar para começar a desinstalação."<br />
      <br />
      Other small fixes in PortugueseBR.nlf.<br />
      <br />
      Message to Casper Bergenstoff, author of Danish.nlf:<br />
      <br />
      - Correct the language ID in "Danish.nsf", is 1030.</p>

      All language files are compatible with the latest Modern UI now!<br />

      When I compiled "C:\Program Files\NSIS\Examples\Modern UI\MultiLanguage.nsi" from today's CVS I've noticed the following<br />

      but i'd like to know why you think that your changes to the two titles make the translation more uniform? and uniform to what? windows? nsis? the rest of the translation?<br />
      you didn't change the meaning of those titles at all</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry that I post this topic in German. It relates to the German translation and especially to the item of Lion King<br />

      Zur neuen Rechtschreibreform: <a href="http://www.duden.de/index2.html?schreibung/aenderungen/zeichensetzung.html" target="_blank">http://www.duden.de/index2.html?schr...ensetzung.html</a>. Das Komma vor erweitertem Infinitiv ist freiwillig, dient meiner Meinung aber der besseren Lesbarkeit. Ich glaube stören tut es auf jeden Fall keinen.<br />
      Es waren ausserdem noch ein paar andere Komma-Fehler (auch nach der neuen Rechtschreibreform drin). Bitte nimm das nicht persoenlich. Danke fuer Deine Uebersetzung!<br />
      <br />
      Mit mehr Einheitlichkeit ist der Infinitiv statt des Imperatives im .._TITLE-String gemeint. Bei Startmenue stand bereits der Infinitiv ("Startmenue Ordner bestimmen") bei ...COMPONENTs_TITLE noch der Imperativ ("Waehlen Sie die Komponenten aus"). Ich habe jetzt fuer alles den Infinitiv gewaehlt, da sonst TITLE und SUBTITLE fast identisch sind.</p>
