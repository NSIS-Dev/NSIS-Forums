      <p class="post-content">*sob* I had just modified my .nsi to match the changes since a7, and it changes again :/ Oh, well, I suppose the changes were needed.<br />
      Anyway, here's a french translation (remove the .txt thing, vBulletin forces me to add this).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh, and btw, here's is another little patch.<br />
      It fixes one macro in your english.nsh ("Back &gt; " becomes "&lt; Back" :), and polishes the french.nlf file (in french, you have a space before some punctuation signs like ":","?","!",";", and you need to accentuate uppercase letters). It removes some errors too ("symbôles" becomes "symboles" and "Execution" becomes "Exécution").<br />
      <br />
      ps: I forgot to modify the header of french.nsh with personal info. So: Sébastien Delahaye &lt;seb@delahaye.net&gt;.</p>

      The French Modern UI Text on the bottom of License dialog doesn't fit in the text area. Can you make it smaller or should I make the text area larger?<br />
      <br />
      <b>Update</b><br />
      Updated the multilanguage system a bit, it now uses defines instead of macro's, so adding new languages is even easier.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think you should make the text area a bit larger, I had many such problems translating for the "main" nsis language files...<br />
      <br />
      I've started working on the Greek language file for modern ui. BTW, my nighly build didn't have a Contrib\Modern UI dir, so I had to get them form the cvs... I think it was nightly build updated Tue, 08 Oct 2002, 07:44:09 GMT.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, I've finished the Greek language file. Any feedback is welcome!<br />
      <br />
      A few comments about modern ui:<br />
      <br />
      - The "Required Space" text area should be larger (just a bit), as in NSIS default (for example, with the greek language file, when displaying 650.0KB doesn't fit completely).<br />
      - In the Uninstaller, the "Uninstall from" text area should be smaller, or have a seperate string in the modern ui language (for the default NSIS a shotened version of the appropriate string is used because the label is smaller, and it looks ugly with the modern ui because there's plenty of space)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, the modern ui looks very sweet! Perhaps you should drop the default ui of nsis and use this one! :)<br />
      <br />
      (off topic: a nsis for linux would be really cool - even a "light" version ;) Perhaps Nullsoft should consider changing nsis to use wasabi or .NET or something so that it becomes multiplatform?)</p>

      <br />
      it is better than the one from cvs, examples: the accept button label doesn't match the translation in German.nlf and the installer advises the user to move the mouse (not the mouse pointer) over the components<br />
      <br />
      however, this is not an update to the one in cvs, I was slower than the other translator because I atually tested the translation with an installer and ran into the bugs described above<br />
      I don't like some of the translations in German.nlf also, so I'll probably update German.nlf and German.nsh later</p>

        But that is also double (the name is already in the titlebar).</b>
      </blockquote>I know, but I never look at the titlebar.<br />
      It's like in websites, I don't look at the titlebar of the browser to see the name of the site, but I look at the header of the page.

      </blockquote>I think that the current way is better, all Windows wizards display the title of the page, and the subtitle is sometimes required to give some extra info.

      <p class="post-content">hmm, it was only an example, I think that only title or subtitle should describe what's going on in the dialog - the other one could be the application name<br />
      <br />
      the problem I have is that there is no German word for 'check', I have to use 'choose' there also<br />
      so the beginnings of title, subtitle and text are identical in the German translation (which of course sucks)</p>

      </blockquote>The title/subtitle should descripe what is going on. The text in the inner dialog should give instructions for the user (what to do).<br />
      <br />
      Are you sure you have no word for 'check' (writing a checkmark)?.

      <p class="post-content">the translation for 'checking a box' in win95 is 'ein Kontrollkästchen aktivieren', so 'activate', but I can't write 'activate the components you want to install' - should I write 'activate the checkbox beside the component list entry you want to install'? it sounds strange to me :)<br />
      <br />
      edit: there actually is a word for writing a checkmark beside finished tasks on a list of sheduled tasks: 'abhaken', but there is no word for removing that mark (uncheck)<br />
      it's useless in this context</p>

      </blockquote>In Dutch, there is also no word for 'uncheck'. I just used 'select'.

      <p class="post-content">I noticed the required space area and it's just fine :up:. I've also updated the greek language file (hopefully this is the last update :)) - go ahead and replace it. For the license screen i've improved the info text (and dropped the ${name}).</p>

      </blockquote>I don't think the greek font's smaller, i think it's probably that you need to have the proper codepage active. The license info text is 3 lines and it's quite difficult to make it two and translate everything (at least in meaning). I hope you see the same thing when you test it :) :
