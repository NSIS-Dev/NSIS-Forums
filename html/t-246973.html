      <p class="post-content"><strong>abort function woes</strong><br />
      I dont expect anyone to just magically know why my $INSTDIR isnt fully being deleted, I've tried moving all file handles off it before cleaning up, etc. I dont get why it leaves behind 6 directories in $INSTDIR, all empty, plus , its very odd to me that none of these directories were used or referenced or allocated a file handle etc.<br />
      <br />
      the whole $INSTDIR is empty too (0 bytes total), but has a subtree still existing with these 5 directories and their relevant subdirs, it cleans up $TEMP and other install locations fine, just not $INSTDIR, as I said before I've setoutpath to somewhere other than $INSTDIR before cleaning up.<br />
      <br />
      any clues would be appreciated although I know someone can't just magically know, well maybe.<br />
      <br />
      thanks people.<br />
      <br />
      Function .onAbort<br />
      # stale file handles would stop something being deleted<br />
      RMDir /r "$CFDIR\customtags\icm"<br />
      SetOutPath $CFDIR<br />
      RMDIR /r "$INSTDIR"<br />
      RMDIR /r $INSTDIR<br />
      RMDIR $INSTDIR<br />
      RMDir /r "$TEMP\${gossTemp}"<br />

      RMDir /r "c:\inetpub\wwwroot\web"<br />
      SetOutPath $TEMP<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      edit: yeah, I know theres 3 rmdirs for instdir in there but that was merely me testing stuff :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">its not the cdrom drive, :) its the location of the installed CF.<br />
      <br />
      I place some files in $CFDIR\customtags\ but .onAbort cleans up $CFDIR absolutely fine.<br />
      <br />
      its just $INSTDIR that leaves behind 6 directories, with subdirs, that I didn't even use or reference in the install, very odd, I mean directories that I DID reference got deleted ok.<br />

      <p class="post-content">RmDir /r could cause an unwanted removal by accident.<br />
      It's better, when you know that your installation creates files/directories on target that you want to clean up, to ${Locate} them and remove them by the safe way. :-)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi, again, I've tried this and it leaves the same folders from before, there MUST be something saying that I cannot delete it, but I'm unsure as to what as I never referenced any of these dirs inside the $INSTDIR.<br />
      <br />
      its funny how the subdir I make in $TEMP cleans up perfectly and I was referencing that all the way through, and running various things from that location. anyway, heres my code, I know theres an RMDIR and a Delete, I was just trying things out, seems I can't get the locate method to work for me either, I use the locate method in the same way to set file permissions for the whole subtree, so I'm stumped :(<br />

      <p class="post-content">if I put a messagebox in the callback function displaying $R9, I can see the files locate finds, and they are the right ones.<br />

      however, calls to rmdir and delete do nothing .. woot!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sorted, I moved the locate line to near the end of the finish page, and now it seems its working perfectly, I had it in a section before obviously being activated by the MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES page, maybe a handle was getting allocated there in the middle, who knows.<br />

      anyway it works great now, so thanks everyone for looking, now onto other issues hehe! :)</p>
