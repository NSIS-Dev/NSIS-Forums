      <p class="post-content"><strong>full localized release (french)</strong><br />
      a few days after the official one, the french release of NSIS2b0 is here :D !<br />
      I really hope there are some other full localizations (this would be great to list them).<br />
      For all french people of the forum (and any other curious girls&amp;guys), you can download it from <a href="http://www.winampfr.com/nsis" target="_blank">www.winampfr.com/nsis</a> ;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">The problem with full localized releases is that they always get outdated. It's not possible to use the latest stuff from CVS.<br />
      <br />
      Also, only a few people need a full localized release, because nearly everyone understands English good enough to find out how to compile a script :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">answers :D<br />
      <br />
      1/ it's not just a translation of the software, the doc is translated too<br />
      2/ i have always prefered using a software that's in french than a english program<br />
      3/ not at all ! Not all people does understand english ! BTW, if someone thinks he/she doen't speak english so well, he/she will be 'afraid' of using a 'not-in-french' software because of misunderstanding (i.e the documentation that you've to understand before truly using NSIS) !<br />
      4/ the logic is the same as have language files for the UI ! Is the UI can be in french, why not the whole program !<br />
      5/ even if the french releases are not updated so much, all releases have been translated (in fact : not all alphas (juste the a6 and a7) ...) ! BTW, i don't really think that downloading each night builds is important :D ;), except for those that are using NSIS very much (and don't have to get the french release :D)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey, I'm not saying that it's a bad idea :D English is also not my native language :) I'm glad that he spends all this time to make NSIS available for even more people.<br />
      <br />
      I actually mean that imho it's a better idea not to translate the script commands and makensis output, but to provide translated documentation.<br />
      <br />
      This way:<br />
      <br />
      * It will be possible for everyone to use the latest version<br />
      * Scripts can be used with all NSIS versions<br />
      * People can look up things in the docs of their own language<br />
      * veekee doesn't have to spend a lot of time every time we update the stuff</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK :D But do you think people really care about the output? It's a lot of work to edit the source files everytime, and it's not possible to use development versions.</p>
