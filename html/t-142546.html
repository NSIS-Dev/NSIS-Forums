The<br>installer was built on WinNT then<br>tested in Win95. When we run the<br>installer on Win95, sometimes a bitmap<br>is misplaced and on one screen the<br>textfields do not display at all.<br>Are there issues supporting Win95?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th July 2003 17:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I don't know of any issues with Windows 95.<br><br>What version of NSIS?

I looked at the<br>.ini file with the bitmap issue and I<br>noticed that NumFields=9 when in fact there were only 7 actual fields. The text fields not displaying may be an issue with the .nsi script as there is some dynamic string writing going on.<br><br>Thanks for the reply.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th July 2003 18:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I understand you found out the problem.

I'm investigating the other<br>problem right now. I probably jumped to<br>conclusions assuming the problems were<br>all Win95, but I was surprised to learn<br>our product manager was testing on Win95 when as a rule we don't support our<br>product on Win95.<br><br>Thanks for the quick replies.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">escroger</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th July 2003 18:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Ok, I think I resolved the textfield problem seen on Win95, but not WinNT. In the .ini file defining the database properties, there are text fields that are to be set later. For some reason, the initital state is empty, with an additional state=1 declaration.<br><br>[Field 3]<br>Type=Text<br>state=<br>left=0<br>right=300<br>top=20<br>bottom=32<br>state=1<br><br>If I remove the state=1 declaration, then the problem disappears. For some reason this is not an issue on WinNT.<br><br>Thanks for listening to my ramblings.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th July 2003 19:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can't have more than one value with the same name in one section. If you do that you get an invalid INI file. Windows NT tends to deal with errors better, I guess that's why you have problems with this on Windows 95.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
