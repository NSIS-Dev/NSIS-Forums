      As per the installation guide - that does not change anything.<br>
      <br>
      Any ideas?<br>
      <br>
      Another question: the installation guide says the above will only build makensis - and that I can drop it (when i manage to build it) into a downloaded precompiled package such as the nightly build.<br>
      <br>
      Where do I find the nightly build?<br>
      <br>

      Does this indicate an error that has something to do with scons or python? Would it help updating to a newer version of python perhaps?<br>

      I am starting to get a bit frustrated and is even considering purchasing a windows server to avoid having to mess with this more.<br>

      <p class="post-content">I've just installed Python 1.5.2 and found the problem. In your original post it's not that clear because you forgot to use [ code ]. The spaces before the error pointer weren't displayed. The error pointer points to the '+=' operator which is not supported in Python 1.5.2. I've fixed that and found more compatibility problems. Lots of them. There were so many and they were getting increasingly annoying. I think it was a weird NameError that got me to stop trying. I've decided I don't want to support Python 1.5.2. Python 1.6 seems to have all that the script needs, so I've added a check for it.<br>
      <br>
      To get around your problem of SCons running on 1.5.2, find the SCons executable, which should be a shell script, and edit it. It should contain some reference to the Python executable. On Windows, it looks for Python on the PATH. Giving it a fully qualified path forces it to use the right version.</p>
