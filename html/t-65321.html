      Hello everyone.<br />
      <br />
      I just got NSIS 1.64 and I quickly went through the included documentation. I did learn a few things, but I'm no closer to making an installer. ;)<br />
      <br />
      If anyone can direct me to some documentation, tutorials or guides on how to make an installer with NSIS, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br />
      <br />
      Just so you know I'm not a moron, I've done a fair bit of programming - Motorola 68k assembler, C, C++ so it's not like I'm totally green. :)<br />
      <br />
      But I have no clue where I should start with NSIS. By the way the installer I'd like to make is quite simple, all it has to do is drop a bunch of files and set/create some registry entries depending on the OS. (win 9x, NT, etc.)<br />
      <br />
      Thank you. :)</p>

      Hi s0mbre,<br />
      <br />
      my advise: take a look at the example files. I learned to program an installation in less than 10 minutes by doing that.<br />
      <br />
      Or download the NSIS Workbench: <a href="http://www.techmarc.ndirect.co.uk/fnsetup.exe" target="_blank">http://www.techmarc.ndirect.co.uk/fnsetup.exe</a><br />
      <br />
      which has a wizard to set up an installation.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck, :D Smile2Me</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>re NSIS workbench</strong><br />
      Thank you very much for your advice. :)<br />
      <br />
      I quickly went through 'Example1' and 'Example2' before retiring and that cleared things up a bit. ;)<br />
      <br />
      I still have a long way to go - clearly further study is required. I'm just a little tired and was hoping for a HOWTO sort of guide. I know how hard it is write to clear and comprehensive documentation though, and I appreciate the resources available. :)<br />
      <br />
      And on the Workbench - I noticed the rave reviews and downloaded it last night. I just thought it would be wise to know how to do things 'by hand' but I certainly intend to try the workbench. :)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again. :)</p>
