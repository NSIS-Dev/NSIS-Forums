I have noticed that on Win98 and ME, when a user clicks "Show Details" their install crawls to a near halt. I have looked into the code a bit, and it appears this is because Windows timer messages come much slower on Win9X, and since the copying of files is linked to these message events, the copying of files is consequently much slower.<br><br>(To see that this is the case, you can run the install, let it grind to super slow mode, and then wave your mouse around the Show Details box. This speeds things up considerably, because you get more event messages when the mouse is moving)<br><br>Has anyone managed to get a fix for this? As a potential workaround, is it possible to disable the Show Details button conditionally, as part of a label Goto?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Lord_Nord</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th October 2001 18:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I've noticed this strange behavior too.
