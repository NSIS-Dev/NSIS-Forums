      <p class="post-content"><strong>Linking issues on NSIS Archive</strong><br />
      Hello All,<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but here goes.<br />
      <br />
      On the NSIS Website I have found recently that clicking on links appears to do nothing, and I actually have to cut and paste the destination in my browser to get there. Is this a problem with the site, or my browser?<br />
      <br />
      Cheers,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Works fine for me on IE and FireFox. Which browser are you using? Are there any specific links or is it happening with all links?</p>

      <p class="post-content">IE6, For example, if I go to the archive and do a search on a specific author, the Authors name in the return list works, but the link for the article doesn't. Even if I try open in new window it doesn't work. But if I copy the string and paste it, it works. My guess is that my browser is definately the problem, but what's behind it I don't know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's your browser. Try Ad-Aware.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I already tried ad-aware, it report 0 objects found. I removed the Google toolbar, and that improved the "clickability" quite a bit. I wonder if it was caused by having the toolbar installed, then ad-aware removing its something to do with the toolbar. Anyways, it's a lot better now. Thanks!</p>
