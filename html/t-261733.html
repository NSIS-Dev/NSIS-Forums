      <p class="post-content"><strong>2 dir paths, different defaults, auto-add for 1, Possible?</strong><br />
      I am trying to get 2 different directory screens working in an installer.<br />
      <br />
      One has the path for the program files, and adds the Default Program Directory to the end if the user browses to a new path<br />
      <br />
      The second has the path for the data files, and does *not* want to append anything to the end of the path if the uses browses somewhere other than the initial default<br />
      <br />
      I've attached a cut down version of the code I am using which will add "myTest2PathDir" to the end of any browsed to path on both directory windows.<br />
      <br />
      I am aware that if I add a backslash at the end of the path for the install directory (thus)...<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />InstallDir "$PROGRAMFILES\myTest2PathDir\"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      ...I can avoid the adding to the end of a browse path, but ideally I want it for the one (program), not the other (data)

      Yes I looked at that page before. It doesn't actually compile, and if I fix the code by commenting out 2 lines, it is looking for a icon file that doesn't exist [line 26] and calling !insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE [line 59] which cannot be found) it doesn't seem to work correctly<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps it is the MUI_RESERVEFILE_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE I removed? I was unsure what that is supposed to do<br />
      <br />
      At any rate the two data directory screens both share the same path, changing one changes the other, and neither append anything when browsing which is what I wanted to do with the install path<br />
      <br />
      From a little debugging, it seems the PRE event is never being called<br />
      <br />
      I had also investigated the forum link on that page, but it seems as if it is referencing older MUI builds? For example it uses !insertmacro MUI_PAGECOMMAND_DIRECTORY which won't compile, where as !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY not only compiles but works well</p>

      </blockquote>I guess you should set up a custom page for the second (data) dir.
