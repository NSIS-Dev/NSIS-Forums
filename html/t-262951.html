      <p class="post-content"><strong>Images During Installation Help</strong><br />
      I have successfully got <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/ModernUI_Mod_to_Display_Images_while_installing_files" target="_blank">this</a> ModernUI modification to display images during installation, but only the top left of each image is displayed.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way to maintain an image's aspect ratio but still display it in smaller form on screen, or resize these images to the user's resolution? I'd like images to not appear warped no matter what the resolution.<br />
      <br />
      Also, is an installer created by NSIS using the default options, a percentage of the screen width, or is it a fixed width on all resolutions?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      </blockquote>You could find the answer easily if you change your screen's resolution :-)

      </blockquote>LOL that's right!<br />
      Anyway, it is fixed. You may open the MUI resource with resource hacker and examine it. Also, I think it's a good idea to open the modified MUI with reshack and collect info about the control that displays the images. It's possible to find there the answer for the 1st part of your post.

      <p class="post-content">Right, and where do I get Resource Hacker and Reshack? Are they hard to use? I don't have much experience with DLL files or the Windows API - all I know is that they are semi-compiled bits of code loaded at runtime.</p>

      There's a bit in the UI file saying this:<br />
      <br />
      CONTROL "", 1000, "RichEdit20A", ES_LEFT | ES_MULTILINE | ES_READONLY | WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER | WS_VSCROLL | WS_TABSTOP, 0, 15, 300, 93<br />
      <br />
      From the little preview box I am guessing that the last two numbers - 300 and 93, are the width and height of the box. Any idea if I am right? What is that string anyway - is it something Windows uses, something only NSIS uses, or something which Resource Hacker has 'generated' to show information about the resource? I literally have no idea.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The dialog you mentioned is the inner dialog of the license page. Yes these 2 numbers are the width and height of this dialog. The string is the design of the current dialog. Dialog 105 is the parent.</p>
