      <p class="post-content"><strong>A few simple (hopefuly) questions</strong><br />
      First I'd like to run around my computer room screaming "WOOOHA, THIS IS THE GREATEST APPLICATION EVER CREATED", but I'll keep myself. Still, thanks alot to the creators for creating such a brilliant, FREE application!<br />
      <br />
      And now for my questions:<br />
      <br />
      #1 - Is it possible to "add files" to the compiled executable? Right now I have a dir where I have setup.exe, two zip files and license.txt, I'd like the three files to be "loaded into" setup.exe if possible. (Right now I extract the zip files using ZipDLL (Thanks for a great plugin!)<br />
      <br />
      #2 - Is there a simple way to log all files created/extracted during installation, so that a detailed uninstall can be created? (Unnecerary, but cosmeticly nice.)<br />
      <br />
      #3 - A little bit off topic maby, but is it possible to install apache as a service using NSIS? I have all the Apache files in a zip file, and I'd like to install the Apache service. (I'm talking about the Apache webserver, if anyone was wondering.)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again for a great application!<br />

      <p class="post-content">1) Use the File command.<br />
      <br />
      2) Well... You can either enable NSIS_CONFIG_LOG and recompile NSIS or create a little macro that will use FileWrite to write to a log and then, or before, call File.<br />
      <br />
      3) It should be possible, I have seen more than one user around here that have installed Apache as part of their package. If I remember correctly they extracted the files and then executed Apache with -i in the command line arugments.</p>
