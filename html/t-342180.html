I have no background on C or C++ programming. So a sample code would be helpful.<br><br>I have a custom page which will load RTF file and show information about the application that I'm installing. This I'm using the 'LoadRTF.nsh' plugin. Now my problem is, how can I embed and extract the RTF file to temporary directory before all the page load using a splash screen initializing progress display like Winamp installer?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th February 2012 15:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can use the Banner plug-in.<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">crystalcoder</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th February 2012 12:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for the advice.

The problem is the display text box for RTF file is too small.
