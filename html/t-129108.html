      <p class="post-content">Whatever you do I wouldn't suggest putting the registry value inside of your program's key. That's the first place someone would look to bypass your trial period. Also, I would make a change in your program to ensure that if the key isn't there and your program hasn't been registered to quit your program immediately.

      </blockquote>Is only a example, the registry is a grand explicity way to read from external of the program. The more safest way is to write in a file (not a INI file).<br>
      <br>
      I've fixed the code that I posted:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
;detect the current date&amp;time in seconds - $1 = current time in seconds
<br>&gt;;Read the old time from somewhere - $2 = old time in seconds
<br>IntOp$0 $1 - $2
<br>IntCmp$0 2592000 0 0 End
<br>MessageBox MB_OK "The time to use this program is expired!"
<br>&gt;;use a definitive code to disable the use of the program forever
<br>End: 
</pre>You can detect if the user changed the time to before the installation time and execute the program to get additional time (after the IntOp of the code above):<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>IntCmp$0 0 0 End 0
<br>MessageBox MB_OK "You cannot use anymore this program!"
<br>&gt;;use a definitive code to disable the use of the program forever
<br>End: 
</code>
</pre>Ever use a definitive code to disable the code when is detected that passed the 30-days and this above. Because if the user change the time to between 30-days after expiring, don't run the installation again!<br>
      <br>
      [EDIT]The file "part 1" is Current Date to Seconds function, "part 2" is Seconds to Date function.[/EDIT]

      Think about this: Nsis as another Language app to create Win32 app,<br>
      and not only to create Installers.<br>
      Nsis has many instructions to do that...<br>
      Cool idea, doesn't? :up:</p>
