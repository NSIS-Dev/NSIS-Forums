      <p class="post-content">I'm in New York, but I've been working on 1.4 beta:<br />
      <br />
      - Labels instead of jump values for Jump/IfFileExists/etc<br />
      You declare labels like:<br />
      <br />
      Poop: File C:\hi.dat<br />
      IfFileExists C:\hi.dat 0 Poop ; try again if it's not there.<br />
      <br />
      - Sections have to be ended with SectionEnd.<br />
      <br />
      - Rewrote a lot of the compiler in one big-ass class, so you could make a program that uses it to generate executables directly (i.e. not having to write out a .nsi file and calling makensis, but simply creating a build object, and doing build.parseCommand("File whatever.exe") etc, then calling build.writeOutput()). Also simplified much of the code by using GrowBuf objects instead of realloc()ing so much.<br />
      <br />
      - Added GetFullDLLPath command (to get the full path to a DLL from the dll name)<br />
      <br />
      - Fixed a lot of little bugs, created a lot of little bugs.<br />
      <br />
      Planned:<br />
      - more bugfixes and cleanups<br />
      - CompareDLLVersions command/instruction.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, expect it on firehose.net/free/nsis in a couple days..<br />

      <p class="post-content">Justin I have to say NSIS really fucking rocks. You update it with kickass features/improvements all the time (I don't know how you have time apart from winamp/shoutcast/nullsoft all other things to do it) at any rate keep the good free shit up! I have yet to use some of the new revivsions for my software deployment but I am wanting to...</p>

      <p class="post-content">With version checking NSIS is going to be brilliant - and give all commercial installers a run for their money.<br />
      And with my little patch program, NSIS 'll do anything those commercial programs can!<br />
      <br />
      NSIS rocks. (and now I'm going to work on my patcher again :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The labeling thing sounds great! Much easier when changing the nsi.<br />
      It´ll be even more like asm... :)<br />
      The version check command is also a feature I´d like,<br />
      as usually program VB when it comes to win programming.<br />
      <br />
      NSIS had almost everything I wanted already in ver1.0 or something,<br />
      but now it is very powerfull!!<br />

      <p class="post-content">This could well be one of the "lot of little bugs" but I thought it was best to mention it anyway...<br />
      <br />
      recursive_create_directory seems to be broken in v1.32 in that it doesn't work when paths more than 2 deep need to be created... :eek:<br />
      <br />
      I did a quick compare with the previous version I was using (1.1h) and I think it's the change of char buf[] to static.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, looking forward to 1.4!<br />
