After all presumably many of you here distribute your installers and so have probably encountered most of the issues that can occur.<br><br>Every time he downloads it then it is just a bit smaller than it should be. He has no issues runing installers of other programs. I tried sending it as an attachment and the same issue occurs.<br><br>I asked him to find the exact size in bytes and he says it is 10,313,728 bytes. It should be 10,319,560 bytes so the copy he downloads is about 7 KB too small.<br><br>I am just going to try sending him a zip instead and to tell him how to install the program manually, so will see if that works.<br><br>I wondered if it could be a virus, but if so why only my program affected and nothing else - and why would it be smaller as a result - usually viruses make a program larger - and you do get stealth viruses, cavity viruses, but the whole point in those viruses is that they don't change the file size at all. So a virus seems unlikely - and he is protected from viruses via Trend Micro.<br><br>Any thoughts anyone?<br><br>Robert (Walker)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th October 2012 09:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Assuming you don't append extra content to the compiled installer exe manually, the installer should give a CRC error ('NSIS Error') upon execution if there is some data missing. I am therefore assuming that this user cannot run your executable. If he/she can, I'm betting the filesize isn't wrong at all, and the filesize is actually reported incorrectly. Maybe there's some problem with his/her filesystem.<br><br>Incomplete downloads indeed don't have anything to do with NSIS. It's probably caused by a broken combination of webserver, internet provider and/or browser. He/she should try to download the file on another computer.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">robert_inventor</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th October 2012 10:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yes he got that error message - and another time he got an access violation message, at OX0FB14818 (just in case something about that address means anything to anyone).<br><br>The curious thing is - that only my file is affected for him - and he is the only one of my users who has reported this issue - and that it is so nearly completed, just 7 KB of the file not downloaded (if it is a download issue). I tried mirrors on my website, same file with different file name and the same happens.<br><br>Also it happens when sending the file to him as an attachment by email as well - so in that case it's the google gmail servers, not my own website server, and still the same issue persists.<br><br>It's really curious - why should he get exactly the same issue by these different methods of sending the file to him?<br><br>Good idea to suggest he downloads to another computer can ask him if he has another computer to use in that way.<br><br>Does anyone have any other thoughts about this? Why just 7 KB smaller, and why it would make no difference sending it as an attachment, and why only my installer would be affected and none of the other programs he downloads and installs?<br><br>I do get users who report incomplete downloads, maybe a few times a year and the mirror file locations have been all that is needed to fix the issue. Can't even remember needing to send it as a file attachment. I get about 150 downloads a day so it is not like it is a seldom downloaded file.<br><br>It is a normal NSIS installer. I don't modify the installer in any way, just run the script from HM NSIS Edit - oh - and I sign it with ksign - don't know if that is anything to do with it? Then upload it.<br><br>I wonder if it could be anything to do with the digital certificates?... Perhaps if something was stripping the digital certificate that might make it smaller - though 7 KB seems rather large to be just the digital certificate - and can't imagine why anything would strip it??</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
