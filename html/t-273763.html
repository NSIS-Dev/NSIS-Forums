      Hi, I have to integrate a toolbar in some of my software but am not sure how to do this, the people that are helping me do this are saying that I have to put the location of the toolbar install and then /verysilent, I get that bit but there needs to be a screen show up when the installation is started after the start page which shows information about the toolbar and an image as well as the option for the user to opt out of the install but I do not know how I would add this screen and do the opting out bit, could anyone point me to a resource of give me some code to do this.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi, I would also know how this could be done in IE and FF. I would like to provide my own toolbar with my software, giving the user the option to install it and also set default homepage to the community website.<br />
      The purpose is not spamming at all, the user should be able to chose not to install the toolbars or changing the homepage.</p>
