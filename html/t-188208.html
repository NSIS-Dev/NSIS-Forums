      <p class="post-content"><strong>Complex s/w updater question</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I've got to create an application updater which is able to update an existing installation over http with the following requirements:<br />
      <br />
      - It has update a file if the local version is older than the remote one<br />
      - It has to download a file if it does not exists locally.<br />
      <br />
      I think I've got to make a "versioning" file which contains some version number for all files. It could contain a line for each file, containing the filename (including the relative path) and a version number. This versioning file would have a local and a remote copy and the difference between these files would tell which files shall I replace or download.<br />
      <br />
      Because the number of the files in question may vary, and quite large, I believe I cannot rely making an INI file (though it would be so easy :( ) and read it via ReadIniStr, since I don't know all the filenames and there's no iterator in NSIS AFAIK.<br />
      I think if creating a small 'diff' plugin which would do the task, however before digging into plugin creation I thought I ask you if there's another, easier to do this.<br />
      <br />
      Regards,<br />
      <br />
      Memph<br />
      <br />
      P.S.:<br />
      BTW, is it possible to use C++ STL classes in an NSIS plugin?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The easiest thing would be to do it in these steps:<br />
      <br />
      1. Download a file off HTTP containing latest version using NSISdl plugin.<br />
      2. Compare it to the last version which should exist in registry.<br />
      3. If versions differ, write new version to registry.<br />
      4. Download new file using NSISdl (if versions differ).<br />
      <br />
      To see if a file exists, use IfFileExists "file" jumpto_ifexists jumpto_ifnotexists<br />
      So, if the file does not exist, use NSISdl to grab the file!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi Afrow UK,<br />
      <br />
      The file you're talking about is the version file I mentioned? Then how would you do the comparison? By reading the file line by line and checking the a value - data pair in the registry if it already exists and is lower than the one in the file?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, it doesn't have to check if the version value is higher or lower than the one in the registry. If it's <b>not the same</b> then obviously the user has an older version (because he can't have an older version than the server!)<br />
      <br />
      Ass for the version file, it would be easiest to use an INI file.<br />
      E.g.<br />
      [Version]<br />
      Latest=1.0.0.2<br />
      <br />
      In your script, simply use<br />
      ReadINIStr $R0 "downloaded\file.ini" "Version" "Latest"<br />
      <br />
      With INI files, I also added other stuff in there including news of what's in the latest release which was listed in a IO textarea!<br />

      <p class="post-content">So the version file contains a version number (so the updater cand check if an update is needed), and a ListBox whose Text contains the list of the files that have changed since the last version..<br />
      What if the a user missed update?<br />

      <p class="post-content">@Afrow UK: Wow, the "download filters" and "download options" dialogs are made mixing Banner plugin w/ InstallOptions. You even tried to put the pictures in the background, that means, you tried to bypass NSIS limitations to make that. That's great (only looking at it, I didn't test it because I don't play the game, sorry).<br />
      <br />
      @memph: I have a suggestion:<br />
      <br />
      - Put the date when the file was modified for every file.</p>

      Good ol' Resource Hacker.<br />

      I made that about a year ago now. It still amazes me how much I put into it (the game I made it for is pretty dead now.)<br />
      <br />
      The code was pretty advanced. It updated itself as well as the game I made it for. It also checked for file differences (size to be exact) for updating as well as non existent files and game dll's.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: Not to mention it even had random BMP's on the side, plus messages on the task-bar. It also downloaded Zip files and extracted them to the correct folders for you!!<br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Oh yeah, that's for sure. The problem is that I do for one that's even older than your game. I don't even play it because it's boring.<br />

      Doesn't these BMP consume much size?

      <p class="post-content">The whole download was one exe of about 2.5mb. The random BMP's consisted of about 5 different ones that were in the exe (uncompressed to temp).<br />
      <br />
      No CVS. Just a basic file which would be downloaded and parsed which contained download URL's, download info, download versions etc.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>extra help</strong><br />
      Currently running into the same problem. Here are the steps i have in my logic.<br />
      <br />
      1. !define homeurl "http://www.somewebsite.com/downloads/"<br />
      <br />
      2. use <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InetLoad_plug-in" target="_blank">Inetload</a> to download update.ini<br />
      <br />
      3. Read in each line of the file and parse the 2 into differnt variables $R0 &amp; $R1 (for example) $R0 == File name $R1 == timestamp of modified date.<br />
      <br />
      4. do a IfFileExists on the $R0 if so timestamp it and store in in $R2 if not jump to HomeUrl$R0 (see step 1)using inetload<br />
      <br />
      5. strCmp $R1 $R2 "" HomeUrl$R0 (using inetload)<br />
      <br />
      ***********<br />
      I created a php page that dynamically searches the server where the files are located and does a timestamp to the file and stores in a txt then i rename it after i am done to an ini. (for some reason couldn't write to ini) <font color="red">*see attachment for my ini file*</font><br />
      <br />
      I read in the line by line and i tried parsing and it works but it seems to never get out of my parsing loop. and i have been stuck at that point for couple days really rattling my brain.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      If you guys could point me in the right direction to how i can read from a ini file (dynamically) and parse line into 2 sections and pop them to 2 different variables? Your help would greatly be appreciated.</p>
