Maybe I will think about a flag to preserve some of the paths (just in case...)<br><br>You're right: as far as I remember, Window$9x is limited on the lenght of the line you use to set the path (max 255 chars) and is also limited on the environmental space of the command processor (can override with "/E:nnnnn" when setting the default command shell in CONFIG.SYS)<br>I will think about a wrapper that works about the 240th char based on ";" proxymity... (will be very hard, I think...)<br><br>About removing the duplicates, I'm using a double-stack method with search of every element of stack in the output chain: if not found, copy the element of the stack 1 to the output chain; if found, skip it.<br><br>I know, it's a bit crappy (as i said!!)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
