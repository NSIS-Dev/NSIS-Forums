      <p class="post-content"><strong>Install applications with same language as installer</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I have a multi-language installer M which displays a list of multi-language applications. After user select which applications they want, we will silently install those applications. These applications (setup.exe files) are not compressed with installer M, they resides in external folder.<br />
      <br />
      The situation I am in is: If user select to run installer M in Spanish, we would like to have selected applications to be installed in Spanish also. Currently, selected applications are installed in English.<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestion on how I can do this?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you are running the application installers silently, you would have to...<br />
      <br />
      A. check if those applications support a language switch on their command-line.<br />
      <br />
      or<br />
      <br />
      B. check if they get language information from the registry somewhere (i.e. previous installs; but beware that some installers check for the existence of a key and may think the program is already installed if you create this key + language value)<br />
      <br />
      or<br />
      <br />
      C. Temporarily change the locale of the user's windows settings in the registry - as this is what most 'smart' installers will default to choosing if run manually. Also rather iffy.</p>
