In most of the places its working perfectly but in few locations m getting a runtime error 50003 after installation, when user try to run the app. This runtime error is due to some conflict in registeration of dlls. I am using UpgradeDll function and the sample script given in NSIS help to install VB runtimes. Can anybody help me to sort out this problem. Its urgent.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th October 2004 15:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Are you sure you haven't missed a dependency?

I am pretty sure that I haven't missed any dependency as software is working fine in lots of places as i also mentioned earlier. Only from few client sites i am getting this error. I would be thankful to you if you could tell me how to ensure that we don't have two versions of same DLL or OCX on client's machine. Secondly how to restart the machine after setup through NSIS. Who knows this would be the cause of this error. Anyway thanks again.<br>Hope to get positive reply from you.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th October 2004 11:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The might-be-missing dependency can be a DLL most people have and was just looked over. Some DLL that comes with Internet Explorer 6, for example.<br><br>If you're using the MUI, the finish page asks the user to reboot, if needed. If you're not using the MUI, you should check the reboot flag using IfRebootFlag and reboot using Reboot, or at least let the user know a reboot is needed.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">scully13</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th October 2004 20:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The link below has some good information about the error message you are having trouble with.<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/biz/rhaminisys/vboledll.html#FixControls" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/biz/rhamini...ml#FixControls</a></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th October 2004 18:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You should make sure that all the latest DLLs (VB SP6) are included.
