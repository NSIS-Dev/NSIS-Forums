Not all of the actions the installers does may have been recorded in log you are using either, for example library registration, registry entries etc.<br><br>Consider how many applications you have installed since you did the basic operating system install. Do you know exactly which version of each of the libraries you have and how they compare the 'standard' versions originally issues. Do you know what other changes were made when you installed the application that put them on your system?<br><br>Consider how happy you would be if someone handed you a copy of (some of) the .NET framework files from their computer, and said 'it works OK for me' rather than an original Microsoft issued installer?<br><br>If you have access to a plain vanilla installation to draw from, then you may be able to use files from there, but if you don't, it is probably safest to use the installations provide by MS (or whoever else originally provided the libraries.)<br><br>As a general rule, if an original installer for the libraries exists, you are better off running it as part of your installer than trying to collect the various bits and pieces from your development system.<br><br>Of course, while troubleshooting you can do whatever you think helps locate the bug, but you should consider the above when it comes to your actual installer.<br><br>Duncan</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">12VoltMan</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th June 2006 19:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks.
