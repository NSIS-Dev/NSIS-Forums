      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      Sorry if this post does not belong here but I don't know if my problem is related or not to NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      I use NSIS to install my application. The installation works fine but my program refuses to start.<br />
      <br />
      The problem comes from the COM Interface integrated to my application. the com server tries to register itself at the initialization of my exe.<br />
      <br />
      When I execute the exe in Vista, I get an exception: EOleSysError, Erreur d'accÃ¨s du Registre OLE.<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone knows if I have to change something in the setup to change the rights of my exe and authorize the registration of my COM interface?<br />
      <br />
      Or do I have to change something in the application itself?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Fabio Chelly</p>

      <p class="post-content">Make sure any files that need "changing" or updating are not stored in "\\program files\your dir"<br />
      <br />
      Do not use Local Machine registry keys - unless they can be set at install time and are applicable to all users.</p>

      <p class="post-content">And make sure you test on Windows Vista RTM version NOT Beta1/2 or RC1/2. MS changed a lot just before the RTM release.<br />
      <br />
      Things that did not work as expected even adhering fully to an API suddenly started working in the RTM version.<br />
      <br />
      Windows Vista RTM is available via MSDN.</p>
