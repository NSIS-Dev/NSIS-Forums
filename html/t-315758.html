BitTorrent pieces are always of a fixed size, so if you add even a single byte inbetween two others somewhere, all file data from that point on will have to be redownloaded because the piece hashes have changed. What you probably want is a diff patcher, not BitTorrent hashchecking.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Rein Masamuri</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th December 2009 09:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Re: Re: Torrent Patcher?</strong><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by MSG</i><br><b>Are you really sure about this?

One method would be to use the md5 plugin on a file and send the md5sum to the server, which then decides what diff file to send back to the installer.

If your software has v1.0, v1.1 and v1.5, then the 1.0-&gt;1.5 and 1.1-&gt;1.5 diff patches will be different.<br><br>To deal with this, you'll have to either do incremental upgrades (first 1.0-&gt;1.1 and then 1.1-&gt;1.5), or keep diff patches for both possibilities. The method I described above would allow the installer to only download the diff patches it needs. If it sends the md5 checksums of the v1.1 files to the server, the server will know it needs to give the 1.1-&gt;1.5 diff patches. Then in the future when you create a v1.6, the server would return the 1.1-&gt;1.6 diff patches.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
