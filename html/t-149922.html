I was using another installer before. Overall I'm quite pleased with it. I'm still finishing up my new installer but it looks like it will be about 30% smaller than my old one (VISE). It also looks a whole lot nicer. Thanks go out to all that work on this project.<br><br>That said, I do find the functionality of the File inscruction a little simplistic. To register a DLL which probably most installs need to do, we have to use a macro (UpgradeDll, which only works on the CVS code, not the latest beta). Wouldn't it be cleaner to have syntax such as this?:<br></p><pre>
<code><br>SetOverwrite ifnewerversion ;note: *ifnewerversion*, not ifnewer<br>File myfile.dll<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      In my opinion, pretty much every file needs to be replaced even if in use, not just registerable DLLs. I don't want my installer not to upgrade a file just because it's in use. So instead of ever using File I always have to use:<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>!define UPGRADEDLL_NOREGISTER<br>  !insertmacro UpgradeDLL myfile.exe  $INSTDIR\myfile.exe $SYSDIR<br>!undef UPGRADEDLL_NOREGISTER<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      That makes the installer grow by chunks for every file since we are including the macro for each file.<br>
      <br>
      Sorry for the long post but it seems like this one change would go a long way for easier/smaller scripts that yield smaller installers.<br>
      <br>
      All the best,<br>
      Santiago

      <p class="post-content">By default, the installer gives a warning when a certain file is in use and gives the possibility to retry. That is what most people need for normal applications.<br>
      <br>
      You can also let the installer automatically close your application, so the files won't be in use.<br>
      <br>
      Registering a DLL is possible with the RegDll command. The UpgradeDLL macro does a lot more:<br>
      <br>
      * Compare versions of file / local file<br>
      * Upgrade &amp; possible if possible<br>
      * Create temporary file if file is in use<br>
      * Copy new file on reboot<br>
      * Register DLL on reboot<br>
      <br>
      This macro is intented for system DLL files (like runtimes etc.).<br>
      <br>
      The is an UpgradeDLL version available for both beta 3 and beta 4 CVS. You can find it in the 'Useful functions' appendix of the documentation. The latest version in the NSIS Archive requires some of the new beta 4 commands.<br>
      <br>
      The reason why NSIS is so small is that we don't add a command for everything that can also be done with the script language. Using a macro is just as easy as a using normal command.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi Joost,<br>
      Thank you for taking the time to reply. I know you must be busy with the next version of NSIS.<br>
      <br>
      I didn't realize there was a version of UpgradeDLL for beta 3. I'll look that up.<br>
      <br>
      If the reason for using macros instead of adding it to the language is to keep the installer smaller, then that's fair enough.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for your time,<br>
