      <p class="post-content">If you mean extracting files from a built NSIS installer it's possible for installers built with out of the box MakeNSIS if you know the exact version, but there are no tools around to do that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank's for reply but I didn't understand what "built with out of the box MakeNSIS" means :)<br />
      Couldn't you be so pleasant and explain in details :)<br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think the "out of the box" comment referred to the fact that NSIS is open source and so anyone can take it, modify it, then build an exe installer and that no-one can predict what will be in that binary because it's been customised, hence you only stand a chance of deflating something built with an unmodified (out of the box) version of NSIS, and even then you'd need to know what version it was built with because the format of the binary changes as NSIS develops.<br />
      <br />
      Basically your chances of finding a deflate program for an NSIS exe are very remote, and the chances of being able to write one are remote too... generally only the exe itself knows how to deflate itself... harsh but true.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh, now I understand. Thanks for explanation. But I don't think that distribution I'm talking about has modified attaching or compression algo. It's just a patch for a game.<br />
      I was using file analyzer and it told me that some kind of attached data starts at specific offset (0x0000B8B9). I looked in using hex-editor bud didn't find any kind of archiver signature or magic word (like PK, Rar, e.t.c.) at this position.<br />
      I'll try to dig in with executable resource explorer, mb it will help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That won't help you... Better look at the source code first. NSIS uses zlib or bzip2 to compress.</p>
