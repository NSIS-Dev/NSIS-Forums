      <p class="post-content"><strong>Change of case question</strong><br />
      I would like my installer to go to a directory of images and change the names of the files so that all the characters in the file name are lower case. I haven't been able to find a toUpperCase or toLowerCase function. How does one do this?<br />
      <br />
      The new server we are moving to is case sensitive and the present files could be upper case, lower case, or mixed. I need these files to be consistent and so I would like them to be entirely lower case. Thanks in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow, I did a search in the NSIS archive and guess what appeared, not 1 but 5 examples. Here's the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=152" target="_blank">StrLower</a> function.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What would be a neat feature is a post that resides at the top of the forum that contains an index of links which fully represent the archive names in real time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ahhhnn, remember StrFunc.nsh (inside Include subdir)? That one that has the command ${StrCase} which changes strings into Lower Case, Upper Case, Title Case and Sentence Case?<br />
      <br />
      To do that command I had to start from those functions you saw in Archive. So thanks Archive members for everything.</p>

      <p class="post-content">My buddy Don (DSelkirk) made the logic lib. I did most of the C side of the Service Library, because I had it implemented in another app, then he ported it so it would work in NSIS. Lots of interesting features that are scattered all over.<br />
      <br />
      I want to update my FileInfo plugin to acquire file sizes and attributes, but I haven't gotten around to yet.</p>
