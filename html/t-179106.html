      OK, I searched the forums, but I didn't found anything that fits to my wishes.<br />
      <br />
      I just wanted to create Dynamic IO Dialogs<br />
      something Like this<br />

      It would be useful, cause the user hasn't to click throught 20 Dialogs when he can make 3 or 4 inputs in only one dynamic Dialog<br />
      <br />
      is there anyway to do this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">thats near to what I'm searching for,<br />
      but I would prefer it to hide the fields complete and not just disable them<br />
      <br />
      nevertheless thanks Vytautas<br />

      PS.: Wouldn't it be fine to have a Flag or a Property like Visibility?</p>

      Well, I hope you didn't start yet to write those 20 dialogs, as there IS a solution to your problem: dselkirk wrote a plugin that can show/hide controls:<br />

      <br />
      unfortunatly if I click on Oracle or SQL it jumps to the Next page like I've clicked on Next and the I cant make any input into the textbox I defined I'll attach the the Script and the ini, maybe someone has an idea<br />
      <br />
      I know that some parts are not complete yet, but they don't use the script evilO gave me... so they shouldnt be responsible for the error</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi :)<br />
      <br />
      Sorry for the delay I had some work to get done..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      1) In the function "cp_leave", just replace<br />
      <br />
      ReadIniStr $R0 "$PLUGINSDIR\<font color="red">dynamic.ini</font>" "Settings" "State"<br />
      <br />
      by<br />
      <br />
      ReadIniStr $R0 "$PLUGINSDIR\<font color="green">ioSDBType.ini</font>" "Settings" "State"<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      "dynamic.ini" was the name of the ini file I used to test the script. So the installer tries to read the user input in a file that does not exist, therefore causing the error.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      2) Another point: I've just spotted that in the script I forgot to "Pop $R0" before the two instructions "Abort" , causing values to pile up... fixed.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      3) Another issue, about the "NOTIFY" flag : there is a bug if the user changes the selection using the keyboard, the 'leave' function is called around 18 times (put a MessageBox and you'll see that..).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for your fixes evilO, but it still doesn't work<br />
      <br />
      if I click on one of the two options, the next dialog is shown - If I use this script only(without my extensions) it works, but as soon as I complete the script it doesn't work anymore<br />
      <br />
      similar thing with the LangString error - I've another Setup which works, but in this script there's an error...<br />
      <br />
      its confusing<br />
      <br />
      some scripts work with parts of code, but other scripts don't even if I adapt the paths and so on</p>

      there are two inputboxes<br />
      i entered some text and clicked next<br />
      <br />
      it copied the files and showed the finishscreen - after pressing finish<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, no it's not related to the bug about the "NOTIFY" flag I told you about.<br />
      <br />
      If you have to go through all the dialogs a 2nd time, it's because you defined all the pages twice in your script, to get rid of the "LangString problem" I guess.<br />
      <br />
      I have just removed the MUI macros between the functions ".onInit" and "cp_show":<br />
      - No LangString warning<br />
      - No "Double execution"<br />
      - The radiobuttons with the "NOTIFY" flags are working<br />
      <br />
      You can check the examples in "NSIS\Examples\Modern UI" if you are still confused..<br />
