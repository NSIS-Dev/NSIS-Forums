      bits, where you set the error details yourself (NSIS doesn't have a variable that contains the error message - if even applicable).<br>
      <br>
      Then use something like inetc ( <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in</a> ) to submit the data to your website (either GET or POST).

      <p class="post-content">Thanks a lot. I noticed the inst failed callabck, but is that called on any failure? If so, it's perfect. The documentation's slightly confusing on this point.<br>
      <br>
      On ifErrors, that basically checks if the return code of the anything in the prior code block was non-zero? It's a non-zero return code anywhere in the code block, not just the last call, right?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks very much.<br>

      </blockquote>'fraid not - it's only called in one situation: the user hitting the Cancel button on the InstFiles page (the page where actual file installation commences).<br>
      The cancel button itself is only enabled if a File couldn't be extracted, or script code (in one of the sections, for example), called Abort.<br>
      <br>
      So if you have, for example, a page that grabs a piece of registry information on which your installer depends, and that registry information is missing, .onInstFailed won't be called, as missing registry information isn't an installation error problem.<br>
      <br>
      If you have such situations to deal with, then, more than likely, you'd want to work with the ClearErrors/code/IfErrors bit as that will give you a bit more information than just "the user hit cancel while installing files".<br>

      </blockquote>Correct - it's for all of the code since the last ClearErrors. If any call after the last ClearErrors sets the error flag, then IfErrors will be true - you won't be able to tell which call, exactly, caused the error so choose your code blocks carefully.<br>
      <br>
      In theory it should be possible to wrap every NSIS command with an error handler, but it would be quite a bit of work on the level of LogicLib... and reading through logiclib code makes my head hurt ;) Perhaps a future version of NSIS will have an internal variable or stack that contains (a) userfriendly error message(s), at least for developers' use.
