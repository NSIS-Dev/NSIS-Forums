      <p class="post-content"><strong>Striping down NSIS</strong><br />
      I'm writing a small app that uses nsis.<br />
      It only requires a small list of features and since size is critical I would like to know how to strip nsis to the bare basics Iâ€™ve edit the config.h file but only managed to shave off 93KB on makensis. What else can i do to cut back?<br />
      And by the way you say 7z compression is on the works in witch version of nsis will it be added?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Function needed:<br />
      Install files and dirs<br />
      write/read registry (remember install folder)<br />
      show license, dir picker &amp; progress<br />
      external ui &amp; custom strings<br />
      <br />
      Using NSIS 2.00b4 (CVS) 22/04/2003</p>

      <p class="post-content">Is the size of the generated installer the important thing or the size of makensis? If it's the size of the generated installer then it's the size of the executable header (bzip2 or zlib version) that you want to concentrate on reducing. KiCHiK or Joost will no doubt give you much much more information :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The exe header is optimized for minial size, makensis is optimized for maximum speed therefore I don't have many tips for it but these two:<br /></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Compile using VC7, it always gives better results for the compiler.</li>

        <li>Compile only one compression method and remove mentions to the second compression method from the source.</li>

      <p class="post-content">Already using VC7 and i want to make both makensis and exehead smaller.<br />
      <br />
      By the way in config.h removing #define NSIS_SUPPORT_CODECALLBACKS gives compile errors (current cvs build) why? if it's optional shouldn't it compile with out it? (but i'm no expert programer (just fouling around)).<br />
      <br />
      but back to the topic can't i just take of unused dialogst or something else? there must be a way to srink it even more (with out using compression metods).<br />
      and what about my 7z question?<br />
      <br />
      And thanks for the replies ;) it's good to be helped.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Makensis.exe is the compiler that generates the installers. The overhead for the installer is only 34 KB. Or do you have to distribute the compiler?<br />
      <br />
      See kichik's post: 7zip compression will be available before NSIS 2 final. You can use the 7zip SFX for now (but that will add about 100 KB).</p>

      <p class="post-content">kichik sorry, i didn't see it (probably toght it was you signature :confused:) and thanks for fixing the errors :).<br />
      I hope the nsis 7z exehead will be the same size or smaller then the current ones 100KB is way overkill (unless you realy need top compression on big files but still).<br />
      Joost Verburg, I need both the exehead and the makensis as small has possible.<br />

      <p class="post-content">100 KB is definately not overkill if you have an installer of a few MB's. It can make it &gt; 25% smaller.<br />
      <br />
      The 7zip/LZMA compression won't make the NSIS exehead that large when it's integrated, it will be optimized. The SFX supports some other compression methods too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That helps for the final result. But you can use UPX (without including it in your package) to compress makensis.exe too. It will compress makensis.exe pretty good. It compresses the current CVS version from 400kb to 150kb.</p>

      <br />
      Place extract7.exe and your compressed files in files.7z in the same dir when you compile and there you go: 7zip compression in NSIS.<br />

      NSIS with BZip2: 13.4MB<br />

      <br />
      got 2.0 RC1 and started to shave the fat again got into the falowing problems.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      removing #define NSIS_CONFIG_PLUGIN_SUPPORT gives<br />

      i commented it out and build worked again (but probably broke something)<br />
      <br />
      removing #define NSIS_CONFIG_ENHANCEDUI_SUPPORT gives<br />

      </blockquote>Interesting, but normally is the header compressed when the scrip is compiled or is it keepted in umcompressed format and if so could i upx them before inclusion in makensis?<br />
      <br />
      Now to upx makensis itself would be a bit uselless since this would prevent normal compression using standart methods and i don't think upx can beat 7z (it didn't beat zip when i tested a year back)

      <p class="post-content">As far as I know, you can't compress the entire header using normal means (7z, bzip, ...) because it's executable. You always need some way to decompress it. This decompression routine is very small with upx, plus I think it's optimized for executables.<br />

      </blockquote>You can't, you'll have to use !packhdr as Gyrbo suggested. makensis needs to edit the resources of the exehead and can't do that when the exehead is compressed using UPX. If you really want you can edit the code and make makensis uncompress the exehead first and compress it back. The only problem is that you'll need UPX for that and that will surely overshadow any size savings you've gained by using a compressed exehead.

      <p class="post-content">Well, I have fixed the compile errors but I can't get it to crash. Make sure you've recompiled exedata.cpp after the exeheads were compiled. Best method would probably be using Rebuild All. If that doesn't work I'll need some more details, starting with the message you get.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well it's me again :), just wanted to say that I'm still with out my computer but i've been writing the Functional Specification of my app with resulted in several changes on it's design (keeps getting more complex with every draft :\).<br />
      <br />
      Namely that i'll be trying to use CEXEBuild directly from inside my app (allowing to trim even more fat), I can coud on you guys for when ever I become confused ;).<br />
      <br />
      Also I been meaning to ask if the dev team has a problem with the name "Saves (NSIS)". If you do I can remove it but it's there mostely to give you guys credit for most of the work :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Make sure that your product can't be misrepresented as being the original version, so you should call it "based on NSIS" or something like that.</p>
