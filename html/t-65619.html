This would happen if you try to open<br>runnsis.bat with CreateProcess or WinExec etc ..., rather<br>than ShellExec, but i don't beleive that such a bug wasn't<br>discovered earlier. What I did was to write simple exe file<br>that launches somename.bat file and rename it to runnsis.bat :)<br>It worked :D , but I don't think this is the best solution ...<br>BTW, The source of this program is attached.<br><br>2) Another problem appeared after that. When you first run program<br>(in its directory by default), build works fine. However, if<br>jou open some file/image/etc... and thus change directory to<br>another one, build fails. I guess, this problem wouldn't happen<br>if the directory of NSIS would be in the PATH, but I personally<br>don't like such solution ...<br><br>And, of course, my wishlist :<br><br>1) There's no info how to find this program on i-net in About box.<br><br>2) Keyword completion, which would consist of at least functions in<br>the list would be great, i think. In Delphi, You have one if<br>You press Ctrl-Space.<br><br>3) Ability to launch external programs with parameters like %p, %f,<br>etc. would be great, especially in such compiler-oriented<br>applications.<br><br>4) Default syntax highlighting could recognize more keywords. I've<br>made one that recognizes many keywords of NSIS, ask me personally<br>to email them, if You wish.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mkeeley</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th November 2001 21:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Alex<br><br>The control is using ShellExecuteEx to execute RUNNSIS.BAT, it needs to wait for the process to complete before continuing. I've had a quick play with other methods but didn't get them to work (perhaps not trying hard enough!), the long file names were being chopped in the batch file e.g. param 1: c:\program param 2: file\nsis\makensis.exe, even if the parameters were placed in "'s<br><br>If it's a problem on Win98, I assume it's also a problem on Win95 and ME so perhaps everyone else is running NT, Win2K or XP???<br><br>Fixed the problem here where selecting an icon or bitmap was changing the current folder and therefore breaking the build.<br><br>Ctrl-Space is used for property/method completion not keywords as far as I know, unless I've that turned off in my IDE.
