      <p class="post-content"><strong>PLUGINSDIR and ReserveFile</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I am curious, do all files that get installed to PLUGINSDIR get automagically set at the top block of the Installer?<br />
      <br />
      Ie, does doing the "File" command with the output location set to PLUGINSDIR automatically get set as a ReserveFile?<br />
      <br />
      Looking at MUI2 source code, I see no particular attempt at Reserving the things that go into the Plugindir, which is why I ask...<br />
      <br />
      Like in Contrib\Modern UI 2\Interface.nsh, we can see:<br />
      <br />
      File "/oname=$PLUGINSDIR\modern-header.bmp" "${MUI_HEADERIMAGE_${UNINSTALLER}BITMAP_RTL}"<br />
      <br />
      I also have some bitmaps in my own code that I copy to PLUGINSDIR, and I want to make sure that indeed, they are at the top of the Installer data code...</p>

      <p class="post-content">No they are not reserved automatically and I don't think this is a problem in Modern UI because MUI.nsh is what you should include first in your script.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Oh, yeah, for the MUI2 files, I can see you don't need to do the Reserve, as its always included first.<br />
      <br />
      But what our scripts, say we have a "File" command buried down in one of our functions towards the end of our script, perhaps 1+ Gigs deep into the Installer.<br />
      <br />
      I guess I better just play it safe, and do the ReserveFile, just in case.<br />
      <br />
      One more question about ReserveFile...<br />
      Does NSIS parse the full script first to find all ReserveFile commands, before it parses the script to actually built the Installer?<br />
      <br />
      If it doesn't, does this mean I need to put the ReserveFile command as close to the top of the "main" script as possible?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think MakeNSIS will run through the script and it will add a file to the data block as soon as that file appears in a "File" or "ReserveFile" instruction. So yes, if I'm not mistaken you should put the "ReserveFile" instructions at the top of your script. But there is <b>no</b> need to reserve any files, unless they are extracted <i>out of order</i>. For example files extracted in your ".onInit" function should be reserved. Files extracted only in normal "Section" blocks shouldn't be reserved...</p>
