      <p class="post-content">The attachment is valid. There are two Word files in the ZIP. They describe the installer tintinz wants to build. The first two threads had an invalid ZIP. This was probably due to a network problem.<br />
      <br />
      tintinz, please don't open so many threads for the same subject. I'm sure you can understand why it seemed like spam or even a virus infection attempt.</p>

      </blockquote>I downloaded the file before to scan on <a href="http://virusscan.jotti.org/" target="_blank">http://virusscan.jotti.org/</a>, but after I did it said that someone else already did it...<br />
      <br />
      This is weird, why someone would put two documents inside a zip without explaining what is inside? It's like putting a contribution without any readme and you are expected to run it - it's just not right. The documents are even with ".doc" extention, where macro viruses can be found. For the .jpg ones, it wouldn't have this "virus" problem, but they were corrupted, so the situation gets even worse...

      <p class="post-content">Maybe will be best that you use <i>*.nsi</i> files instead of words and post exactly what's the problem...<br />
      <i>Help Needed To Create An Installer</i> is very ambiguous.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yep.<br />
      <br />
      i too recommend .nsi or .txt files in place of .doc files.<br />
      <br />
      no one codes with ms word :D<br />
      <br />
      regarding the project:<br />
      i read the requirements, seems like an easy task ...<br />
      <br />
      though i got not enough time atm to do such things.</p>
