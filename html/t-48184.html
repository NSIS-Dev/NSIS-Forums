How hard is it to scroll down a textbox? Anyway, it's not like it's effective at all. Users just have to scroll down and press the button; there's nothing that forces them to read the license. It's their fault when they break the agreement because they didn't read it.<br><br>A timer, I'm sure, would catch you crap. I know I wouldn't want to have to sit and wait before I could install software. We all know that most users would go get a cup of coffee during that time and not read the license anyway.<br><br>My conclusion is that there is no need for either of these features. If you really want them bad, just add them to the software yourself or get someone else to add it for you. This is one of the reasons why it's open source...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mcgarrah</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th April 2001 16:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The legal folks decided we needed to force the<br>user to at least view the entire licence (even<br>if only for a microsecond).
