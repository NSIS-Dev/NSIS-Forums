I wonder which plugin to use for that. I know downloading files during installation could be a failure point in the installer and thus I'd like a plugin that is the most reliable (works on Windows XP/Vista/7, 32/64 bit) and has the minimum dependencies on external libraries (if at all).<br><br>Any experience? is inetc the one to use or something else?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Animaether</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">1st September 2010 21:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">We've been using inetc without problems related to inetc itself for quite a while now. The main problem comes from people who simply do not have an internet connection / go through a proxy that requires logging in first (think some hotel wifi services) / are on a VPN that blocks access - and, of course, problems with the internet resource itself (site down and such). Can't really do anything about those cases, though, and you'd run into them with all of the plugins ( note that there aren't exactly many of them.. nsisdl is included, inetload is essentially deprecated by inetc ).</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
