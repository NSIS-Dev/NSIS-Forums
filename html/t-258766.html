      hi all...<br />
      <br />
      i'm trying to send silent emails from the client, after a customer has installed my setup.exe...<br />
      <br />
      this email should only be an information for myself...<br />
      <br />
      how can do this with nsis...</p>

      <p class="post-content">you can't just with nsis, but you could include any of many command line e-mailers and do a silent execution of that. I've used "blat" myself in an IRC bot before I learned sockets - but there's many.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>mmmhhh</strong><br />
      well, but I think it won't work like that.<br />
      I had visited the URL's...<br />
      <br />
      very confusing...<br />
      <br />
      email sending should be hidden for the customer, that he doesn't know it...<br />
      <br />
      isn't there an easier way to go???<br />
      <br />
      maybe .vbs or something else???<br />
      <br />
      thx</p>

      <p class="post-content">blat is a command line application. You can run it with the nsExec plug-in to hide the console window, if it even shows one. You can't get much more silent than that.<br />
      <br />
      On a side note, you should be aware that doing something like that in your application or your installer will be considered by most as a violation of their privacy. "Calling home" by sending e-mails or visiting websites, even if not for collecting information (which is usually not the case), without the user's knowledge would get average Joe pissed. Furthermore, most modern anti-virus software will warn the user of this activity in some way, especially if done from VBScript.</p>

      <p class="post-content">indeed... I was presuming this was under a custom page that allows the user to send feedback / some manner of registration info (if you don't have a web server), etc.<br />
      <br />
      The installer I'm working on, for example, has an option to check up-to-dateness online, but even that is behind a button that the user is free to press or not.<br />
      <br />
      Your software -will- quickly be labeled spyware if you don't make that e-mail optional, or at least clearly state that an e-mail would be sent.</p>
