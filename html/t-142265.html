      <p class="post-content">I have crash problem when I'm using korean at Modern UI.<br />
      I don't know the reason exactly, but I found that some korean characters in korean.nsh file make problem. Those characters are in MUI_TEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE, MUI_UNTEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE. I changed those characters and It works well now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry It was not crash, It was access violation error.<br />
      (MUI version is 1.65, and I use a Windows 2000 pro.)<br />
      The charater I removed is 'Àû' &lt;= this is korean letter.<br />
      (I don't know whether another korean character exist that makes proplem.)<br />
      Whenever Installer meet this letter, It create Msgbox "Application Error / The instruction at "0xxxxxxxx" referenced memory at "0xxxxxx". The memory could not be 'read'"<br />

      <p class="post-content">I can't remember original message.<br />
      I changed two messages like below :<br />

      MUI_UNTEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE "ÇÁ·Î±×·¥À» Á¦°Å¿¡ ¼º°ø ÇÏ¿´½À´Ï´Ù."<br />

      As I said, "Àû" character makes trouble. I put that charater to anyother messege for test. Same error occured when Installer meet a section including that message.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm sorry, but that doesn't help. I need to know what the message says exactly and if it happens in other scripts. I can sort of understand from your message that it does, but I need a direct answer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm experiencing same symptom as Park's.<br />
      Korean Windows 2000 Pro, downloaded on July 16th, using Modern UI 1.65(1.65 - June 16, 2003 : changelog says so)<br />
      <br />
      I checked Dr Watson event from event viewer:<br />
      at 00406CFE (&lt;nosymbols&gt;), c0000005 exception occurred.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        If you rephrase your request "what the message says exactly and if it happens in other scripts" , maybe I can understand fully.
      </blockquote>I think kichik wants to know:<br />
      <br />
      (1) Is the message the standard MUI one or has it been modified by the script. If the MUI messages have not been modified by the script then MUI_TEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE should be "Setup was completed successfully." But it sounds like you are getting the problem before the installation gets that far?<br />
      <br />
      (2) Does the problem happen with any of the standard MUI sample scripts (in "C:\Program Files\NSIS\Examples\Modern UI") or does it only happen with scripts someone has written (even if all they've done is modify a sample script).

      <p class="post-content">No, I'm talking about the crash message. I'm trying to solve the problem, not learning another language ;)<br />
      <br />
      flyingfish's report helped, and I think I know what the problem is. But I need to make sure. So please run the installer in the ZIP file, choose Korean and tell me the exact text in the crash message. It would also be helpful if you can check it on b3.</p>

      Is it good news? Or, ironicaly, bad one?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I haven't changed a thing. I have just included a .map file that matches the exehead used. The differences between that day's version and today's version have nothing to do with languages.<br />
      <br />
      One thing I can't understand is when exactly it crashes. Right after LandDLL? In a certain page?<br />
      <br />
      How about the attached version (compiled with b3)?<br />
      <br />
      And what happens if you download CVS version from today and try compiling yourself?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Further report :<br />
      I built it with Debug code and when the access violation occurred, fired up the debugger.<br />
      <br />
      The culprit is pointer "in" of<br />
      <br />
      while (*in &amp;&amp; out - ps_tmpbuf &lt; NSIS_MAX_STRLEN)<br />
      <br />
      However, both "out" and "ps_tmpbuf" seems to have corrupted value.<br />
      Especially ps_tmpbuf.<br />
