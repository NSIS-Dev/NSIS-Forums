      <p class="post-content"><strong>Why is winamp nsis installer so big?</strong><br />
      Tell me way oh way is the winamp installer so big.<br />
      <br />
      It uses NSIS v1.45<br />
      <br />
      I thought it was just Ryan Geiss's Nullsoft releases (Milkdrop, etc) that were using the old version without the bzip etc compressing. We have saved about 50% on the size of the install for MilkDrop with this.<br />
      <br />
      Many text files is mostly the reason for but with all the AVS presets (text agian) in the Winamp install surely it will knock a few hundred K of the size of the install.<br />
      <br />
      This will surely make everyone happy downloaders and winamp web admin/ISP too. With the something like 100 million downloads of WA a few hundred K will mount up.<br />
      <br />
      Since I have discovered NSIS I have been spreading the word to the rest of the WA plug-in community and now more use NSIS with bzip or similar super compression. But WA does not.?!?!?! :confused: :confused: :confused: :confused: :confused:<br />
      <br />
      bzip and similar compression came in the lot later v1.90 did it not.<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone know why not? Surely someone has noticed this before??!?!?!?!?!?!?! OR am I the first one. Or am I just stupid??<br />
      <br />
      A I have NSIS limited to just above ZIP2EXE convertor could any tset this and see if it is much smaller or not with the super compression types.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The best thing to do for me to verify your argument was building an installer from the Winamp files on my harddisk. My Winampdir was 3.69 Mb and was compressed to 387 Kb with zlib and to 407 Kb with bzip2. Of course this is not the best test since the Winamp installer also includes a lot of script for making the proper registry entries and links and also the program that runs after the NSIS installer (to set custom settings as "Associate with Audio-CD".<br />
      <br />
      From these test results, I think it can become smaller using current NSIS, but by how much is not sure. Maybe only a tiny bit since I really do not know what is actually included in this installer.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I just thought you might have access to the WA NSIS scripts.<br />
      <br />
      Then it would be easy to test. :)<br />
      <br />
      Something for WA staff to think about though.</p>
