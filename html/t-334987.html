      Hi<br />
      <br />
      I was thinking about using the high-order word of the section flags to store my own stuff, as according to NSIS documentation only the bits in low-order word are used and quick check to the NSIS source code seems to confirm it.<br />
      <br />
      I wonder, has anyone done this before?<br />
      <br />
      And other than it been very bad practice :p, does anyone know any reason why I shouldn't use the high-order word of the section flags?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">1: It will break upward compatibility.<br />
      2: It's not designed to store your own stuff, that's what variables were created for.<br />
      3: It's an unnecessarily complex way to store information.<br />
      <br />
      In other words: Bad practice isn't just "not recommended" practice, it's "bad" practice. Waste of time, breaks stuff, zero gain.</p>

      <br />
      I am well aware that there is the correct way to code this, but in this case the correct way is big ugly lump of rather static code that is real pain in the ass to update. With this hack I can use one simple function that works dynamically and takes very little effort to update.<br />
      <br />
      ps. I already have another idea in my head that isn't as nifty, but should work just as well.</p>
