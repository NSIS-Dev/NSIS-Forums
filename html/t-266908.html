However, as soon as I use a &lt;sshexec&gt; or &lt;scp&gt; task to try to move the files to another server, Ant hangs at the connection phase. I've tried to separate the building and publishing into different targets that call each other, and that doesn't do any good. I've tried calling them both from a single ant call... no good.<br><br>It seems like the only way to get around it is to have two completely separate Ant calls, one to do just the building and another for just the uploading. And while I normally wouldn't have a problem with this, the build system that this has to go into does so I really need to get it all to happen during a single call.<br><br>Has anyone seen or heard of anything like this before?<br><br>I'm running Java 1.6, Ant 1.7, NSIS 2.24, jsch 0.1.3.1.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Leigh</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd March 2007 09:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You'd probably get a better answer in an Ant related forum as this seems like a problem with Ant not waiting for makensis. The only thing I can suggest is that you take a look at projects using Ant for NSIS, like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsisant/" target="_blank">NSIS Ant Task</a>.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
