I was temporarily away.<br><br>I took your advice. I have un-installed NSIS version 2.15 and re-installed the latest NSIS version 2.19.<br><br>I then re-compiled my sets of application into an installer. <b>However, I still received this error message when I choose to right click on the installer or press 'CTR + C', 'DEL', 'SHIFT + DEL' keys.</b><br><br>Nonetheless, the problem seem to appear in some PCs (Including mine) but it does not occur in other PCs (With similar OS platforms). After comparing the basic differences in systems configurations between the PCs, <b>I found out that this was due to nature of the selected compression type for the NSIS Installer.</b><br><br>By Default, I would define the NSIS compressor as default compressor(ZLIB) if I am not mistaken. With my PC installed with file compression applications that recognizes this compression type (E.G. ZipGenius file compressor), the error message would appear if I tried right-clicking the installer.<br><br><b>If I were to UnInstall ZipGenius, I would not have this problem anymore.</b><br><br><b>Another alternative that I tried was to keep my ZipGenius application installed and Re-Configure the compression mode of my NSIS Installer to BZIP2. This problem does not seem to occur.</b><br><br><br>Thanks Afrow very much for the advice. It's also good that I upgraded my NSIS Installer. I think it's about time to do so.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
