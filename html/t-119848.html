      The basic structure of the Archive is now up and running at <a href="http://nsis.sf.net/archive" target="_blank">http://nsis.sf.net/archive</a>. We don't know if it's going to remain there (sourceforge performance seems to fluctuate wildly).<br />
      <br />
      It now needs a lot of love and attention in the content department. Whilst I (or you) am getting this together feel free to use the site and definitely report any problems, suggestions, issues etc to me via PM or email.<br />
      <br />
      I'm back at work tommorow (errm looking at my watch I'd better make that today :() so I might not be that responsive but rest assured I am around.<br />
      <br />
      We want this to be something you can easily get involved in so feel free if you know something, some clever trick or some way of detecting if a program is installed, whatever, go on and create a page in the archive about it.<br />
      <br />
      I've disabled the file upload feature for now, it depends on which server we end up hosting the archive on.<br />
      <br />
      So: <a href="http://nsis.sf.net/archive" target="_blank">go go go</a><br />
      <br />
      [note: it expects cookies to be enabled and has only really been tested with IE6 and Mozilla 1.3a]<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>User Profiles</strong><br />
      I've now added support for storing your email address and your Winamp forum userid in your profile on the Archive. The email address is only visible to administrators and I have made it possible for you to specify this in case you do not have an account on the forum (which also would contain your email address).<br />
      <br />
      If you login to the Archive then click [Preferences] at the top the page should now show you your current email address and forum userid settings and gives you the opportunity to change them.<br />
      <br />
      Many (if not all) places in the Archive that show a username now allow you to click that username to be taken to view their profile.<br />
      <br />
      Please add your details to your accounts as soon as possible so that if needs be you can be contacted by administrators or other users regarding content you have created.<br />
      <br />
      You Winamp forum userid can be determined by hovering over your username anywhere it is mentioned in the Winamp forum (you should see a url something like <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/member.php?action=getinfo&amp;userid=70214..." target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/member.php?...serid=70214...</a> that last number, 70214 in my case, is your userid. Supplying this on the Archive will allow people to PM you on this forum.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks, Ximon.</p>
