      <p class="post-content"><strong>LogSet / NSIS_CONFIG_LOG</strong><br />
      The documentation for the LogSet instruction indicates:<br />
      "...Note that NSIS_CONFIG_LOG must be set in the installer configuration (it is not by default) to support this."<br />
      <br />
      My (newbie) question is:<br />
      - how do I set up this parameter ?<br />
      - if there is a value that must be used, what are the possible values ?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a lot for your help (by the way, NSIS is GREAT)<br />
      <br />
      Herve.</p>

      <p class="post-content">In your NSIS directory go to Source\exehead and open config.h.<br />
      Uncomment NSIS_CONFIG_LOG and recompile. You will then have a zlib makensis with log support.</p>

      <p class="post-content">why do you have to recompile? do you mean recompile the source code of the nsis installer software.<br />
      this makes no sense to me why you would have to recompile to get a log file. why is this value not set by default, for people that have no clue how to recompile the nsis installer, or do not have the software to do so?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It makes NSIS smaller. The log is something rarely used and thus exluded from the default configuration.<br />
      If you need help recompiling feel free to PM me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">how much smaller does it make it without this option?<br />
      it seems to me like it should just be a setting that you can turn off somehow in the installation script.<br />
      i understand that you just have to recompile, but for me, i would rather use the standard distribution build, because am not interested in retesting my own build of the installation software. i am interested in testing my software that i am trying to distribute with this installation software. if i use the standard distribution, i know that somebody else already tested it, and other people will also catch problems, and fix the problem for the whole group, as opposed to me trying to troubleshoot a piece of software that i modified, that i am not familiar with, and one that will be variant from the mainstreem. i am not saying that i want to just let somebody else just do all the work of building this software just for me to use, but i think that it is dum for me to use my own unique version, that nobody else uses. i thought the whole point of this piece of software was that every feature should be able to be configured easily by anybody through the .nsi scripting files, and not rebuilding the installation software itself.<br />
      <br />
      if it does add too much size to the installer, is there any way to add a plugin that can turn on the log file writing, and then you could just not use the dll file if you did not want that size.<br />
      <br />
      also, what does PM mean?</p>

      <p class="post-content">about the last question : pm means 'private message', and and available when clicking on the little pm under one's post ! Here, direct link is : <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/private.php?s=&amp;action=newmessage&amp;userid=44024" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/private.php...e&amp;userid=44024</a><br />
      <br />
      No plugin can be used to add log feature in NSIS ! In fact, compiling with LOG option make the program to compil more code (the code is surrounded by a 'if LOG feature enable') ! So, this is written in the NSI compiler ! The log option should have been test by a lot of people and is working ! This would not be a NSIS modification : this would be still the official NSIS ! But if the one that try to recompile your NSI file has not the LOG feature enabled, this will not work ! The feature adds 3kb in the final install file !<br />
      But you can use !ifdef NSIS_CONFIG_LOG / !endif instead ! :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">the problem is not to define log in the nsi, but to define it before compilation ! In anyother case, makensis won't have the correct instructions to understand the log functions... the only way is to re-compile it (kichik proposed it) !</p>
