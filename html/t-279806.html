      <p class="post-content"><strong>Executing a shell program</strong><br />
      I'm currently having trouble executing a program located inside a folder I'm installing as the installer goes.<br />
      <br />
      The program that the installer is for depends on SQL Server, and the program i'm trying to execute has the sole purpose of attaching the database to SQL Server.<br />
      <br />
      The thing is, whenever I execute the program outside the installer, as in double clicking on it, it works just fine, and attaches the database without the slightest problem. However, whenever I try to execute it from within the installer, either its not actually executing, or its not working.<br />
      I have tried all of the following:<br />
      <br />
      ExecShell "" "$INSTDIR\attach.exe"<br />
      nsExec::Exec "$INSTDIR\attach.exe"<br />
      ExecWait '"$INSTDIR\attach.exe"'<br />
      Exec '"$INSTDIR\attach.exe"'<br />
      <br />
      None have worked so far. Any recomendations...please?<br />
      Any help would be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Make sure you have the path 100% correct (i.e display it in a MessageBox) and make sure you have the correct working directory set (use SetOutPath).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey Stu. Thanks for the recommendation, but the path is correct :( (how much i wished that had been the mistake &gt;.&lt;)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      And about the correct working directory, the executable i want to execute has to be in the current Directory? (as in the one currently set on SetOutPath)<br />
      <br />
      Because i'm indicating exactly where the .exe is (its in the root folder of the directory i'm installing to), even then it has to be in the current working directory?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance</p>

      <p class="post-content">THANKS ALOT STU!<br />
      <br />
      I didn't know that to use ExecShell it needed to be in the Directory set out with SetOutPath.<br />
      <br />
      When you told me that "...and make sure you have the correct working directory set (use SetOutPath)." I noticed that no...I wasn't quite doing that.<br />
      <br />
      Oh man, you have no idea how grateful I am. Thanks alot!</p>
