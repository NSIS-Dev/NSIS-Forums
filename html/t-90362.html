Has this been implemented? Could it be made into a DLL? I like this method since it give all possible Windows versions and service packs in an easily usable format, with very little script code.<br><br>2. <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=70361" target="_blank">This thread</a> contains just such a DLL, but not delivering the same flexibility (I think).<br><br>3. Functions.htm describes a function to do the detection, but not to the extent of number 1 above, or even number 2.<br><br>Number 1 would be the preference since it has maximum flexibility with very little overhead. Can anyone explain (if it is not implemented somewhere) how I could implement it without having to recompile NSIS (don't know how to do that).<br><br>Has anyone come up with a better method recently?<br><br>Hope someone can help...I need to be really specific about the OS version.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">rainwater</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th June 2002 05:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The dll I (#2) wrote returns the exact version string(major and minor) of the windows distribution.

If I am correct, it returns major version number, minor version number, and build number.

Do you just want to cause a dial up connection to be initiated (whatever the default one is) or do you want to initiate a socket connection to a particular place? I could probably make a basic socket client in a dll quite easily.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">simham_uk</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th June 2002 13:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Sunjammer, it's OK, Kichik is having a look at a solution.
