Tell the user to reboot before continuing. On the reboot, flagfile will get removed.<br><br><br>That sound right? Is there any way to know if there are any files which couldn't be removed? If everything removed successfully, I wouldn't want to create the flagfile.<br><br>Also, how does NSIS tell Windows to remove these files on reboot? A file somewhere or a registry key? Perhaps it would be easier to loop through that and see if there are any files in the directories I care about that are pending a reboot?</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
