      <p class="post-content">Hi Everybody,<br />
      I thought of creating a very advanced GUI tool and script generator for the super duper superPimp and Im in the verge of finishing it. The whole idea behind this is the Software generates scripts according to ur specifications and adds on scripts itself according to the details specified by you..(Eg., Uninstall scripts and dll registration scripts are added on by itself). The UI also allows u to add a very large number of files and make complicated scripts easier. It has mainly been made keeping in mind all the advanced users and also is easier for a newbie to handle.<br />
      As the change in NSIS happens so frequently., I thought that i might not be able to work continuously upon it thus thought of keeping it open a open source project in SourceForge. The tool is being developed in VB6.0 and those who are interested in contributing may mail deep_soft@hotmail.com for further details. (The Generator has been designed in such a way that many features can easily be added according to the newer releases of NSIS)<br />
      <br />
      ... Thanks for reading patienly for such a long time and here are a few initial screenshots ....<br />

      <br />
      Do send in ur comments and mail me for further details ... I hope more and more users contribute to this code making it easy to handle any large number of scripts using NSIS ...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Looks excellent. I really like how you make installation file addition so easy and extensible. And it looks like you managed to cover most (if not all) of the advanced commands/features of NSIS. I do think that this may be way over the heads of newbies. I propose that you have a "Learning" mode which unclutters the workspace, and hides and disables all features that aren't essential to a working script. That way, a newbie could easily work his way up, until he can fully understand the effect of every feature. Just a thought.<br />
      <br />
      And yes, getting a Sourceforge account for this is terrific. I think that by using this forum, we can coordinate development, so that we can make the kickass-est product possible. After all, communication between developers is key.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the comments,<br />
      <br />
      I shall be launching it in SourceForge in the next two days, one problem with the code is that it is not properly commented... Hope everybody can understand the code as it is quite simple and want more developers to join so that a new version is released with every new version of NSIS ....<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi Everybody,<br />
      I have added lot more new features to the Intelligent NSIS script generator according to the latest 1.32 release and I have also created the sourceforge account. I will be able to upload all the files after the guys at sourceforge validate the project (grrr)! So I hope to release the files by 2 days. How many developers will lend a helping hand in making this project quite successfull is still a question that is on my mind !!! Please key in ur comments and other features that are required. Version 0.1 beta will probably be released in two days ...<br />

      I'll help in Delphi/VB land if I ever get any time ever. Which I probably won't :(</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Also working...</strong><br />
      I am also working on a program for making Scripts but that is for PiMP Script (.PSC) used by the Plugins on Winamp.com, and thought of making the program support NSIS scripts too. My program should have the ability to read existing scripts even if it has a different layout than what the program ouputs. Th program is Wizard based and let's you see the entire script genrated in the finish page. Here you can make manual modifications if you'd like and then click the Fininsh button, this compiles and runs the installer. My current homepage is not <a href="http://www.saivert.com" target="_blank">http://www.saivert.com</a>, but <a href="http://saivertshomepage.***********." target="_blank">http://saivertshomepage.***********.</a> The reason for why I don't have the cool address anymore is because NameZero closed my account cos' I didn't answer their email in Christmas 2000. I was on vacation and couldn't find any PC.<br />
      I hate NameZero for that and will try out NameDemo.com instead.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      the GUI Script Generator is a good idea. Though<br />
      it would be preferably implemented in C++ rather<br />
      that using VB. VB needs lots of DLLs and other<br />
      stuff that is not installed on all systems. For<br />
      example, I tried to run it on my own computer.<br />
      Doesn't work. MSCOMCTL.OCX missing.<br />

      <p class="post-content">hi guys,<br />
      <br />
      i wrote a scripter-frontend for pimp almost a year ago (called 'powerpimpit'),but never released it, cause i thought it wouldn't interest anyone.<br />
      <br />
      now i am rewriting the whole thing to work with nsis also.<br />
      i have done some _basic_ things yet.<br />
      <br />
      i uploaded both (the old and the new one) to my tripod account where you could download and test it. (keep in mind the new one is prebeta)<br />
