So far it seems very promising. Unfortunatly I have run into some problems. I believe I have an error somewhere in nsis, but not a script error.<br><br>I am writing a plugin that goes into a drafting package that is called AutoCAD. I have been using inno for about 2 years now to install the plugin and it works fine. I wanted to go to a more advanced installer so that I could make some tighter checks on the autocad version, mdac, etc.<br><br>When I compile the nsis script I get an install that seems to work, the files are all put into the right places and are registered correctly (I checked using a product called comxplorer by 4developers.com). When I fire up AutoCAD it and try to run the plugin AutoCAD crashes.<br><br>Now, I create an inno setup using the exact same source files and this install works as before and Autocad runs the plugin correctly. This leads me to believe that there is a problem with my nsis script, something that I have missed. I printed both scripts out and looked at each line, I couldn't find any files that were not installed in the nsis script that were not addressed in the inno setup. I think it might be that I missed a flag or something like that.<br><br>I have included as an attachement a zip file containing my nsis script as well as my inno script. The nsis script is considerable bigger because of all the nice features that nice has available. But the "sections" are where the files are installed.<br><br>Thanks.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">fenrisW0lf</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th September 2004 18:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I found a couple of mistakes in my nsis script.

      <p class="post-content">I am going to try it either tonight or tomorrow morning. But what bugs me is that I can have my source directory and compile both and inno and nsis install from the exact same files. Then I install inno on my test machine and it installs fine and the program runs as expected. Now if I do the same thing with nsis, it appears to install fine. All the dlls and ocx's that need to be registered are (verified using a program called comxplorer by 4developers.com). But when I try to launch my plugin application from the host container, AutoCAD 2000, it crashes taking the host with it. This is what I find odd. I think there is a problem with the script, probably with the conversion of the inno flags to nsis.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The only difference I could find is that actrpt2.dll and ccrpTmr6.dll are installed into $SYSDIR instead of $INSTDIR\dlls.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe some DLLs fail to register. Try the attached Library.nsh and see if any error messages pop-up. If some fail, maybe there are depenedcy problems because the DLLs are not copied in the same order as in the InnoSetup script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well I spoke too soon. I tried the install on another computer and it my program wouldn't run - the same problem as before (at least that is what I think).<br>
      <br>
      I have been changing the installation order of some of the files. The documentation on some of the components doesn't mention that they need to be installed in a particular order. So I am trying different combinations to see if that makes a difference.<br>
      <br>
      I am wondering about uninstalls, should file be uninstalled in reverse order of their installation and registration?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I finished reinstalling the host application, but the results are the same as before. Is there something that Inno is doing that I am not doing in my script? I had a friend of mine run the install on 5 of his computers and it failed on all 5 of them (they all had clean installs of the host program). I checked the install logs (from the dump routine) and it appeared that the installation proceeded as expected. The inno installation worked on all of them. This is what has me puzzled.<br>
      <br>
      Should I be using older methods to install the required files as opposed to the new library.nsh?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think it's related but you might try to replace the RegDLL line in Library.nsi with a call to regsvr32.exe. Use:</p>
      <pre>
<code>ExecWait "regsvr32 $R4"</code>
</pre>I have intentionally left out the /S switch so you'll which DLLs are registered and which fail, if any.<br>

      <br>
      Changes are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>always register DLL/TLB, even if the installer didn't copy it there</li>

        <li>only copy one RegTool and use it to register all of the DLLs and TLBs</li>

        <li>extract the RegTool as an .exe so explorer won't complain it doesn't know how to open the file</li>

        <li>fixed REGDLLTLB registering just as a TLB</li>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry I didn't get back sooner. I installed the updates that you provided. Then I created a build (using files that I know work with inno) and installed it on one of my problem machines. I got what I thought were some promising results. When I tried to execute my program, it caused a prompt to be displayed which was asking for some missing pieces of MS office 2003.<br>

      Unfortunately, when the pieces of MS office 2003 were installed, the program crashed - the same as before. While inno seems to work everytime.<br>
