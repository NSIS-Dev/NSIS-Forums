The installer is very flexible in that it can be re-run repeatedly to install tools that weren't selected on first install.<br><br>As part of an "update" to this set of tools, a new tool is to be added. The "update" is actually a cut-down version of the main installer, just deploying the new tool, and perhaps upgrades to the tools that need them.<br><br>The idea would be that the "update" installer would be run, and somehow "register" the fact with the main installer that this new tool exists. We've covered the scenario about new tools being available via a configuration file.<br><br>Is it possible to add a section to the components page that displays this new tool?<br><br>My first thoughts are that the answer is "no" since sections are created in the installer during its compilation.<br><br>Does anyone know better?<br><br>Thanks in advance.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mauvecloud</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd April 2008 17:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I think you can approximate your desired behavior by having several hidden sections, then using SectionSetText to un-hide one or more of them.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">{_trueparuex^}</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd April 2008 20:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I have also struggled with dynamic sections...<br><br>The short answer is no, you can't add a sections dynamically. But like mauvecloud hinted, you can create a number of dummy section that are then modified with SectionSet* commands at run time.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
