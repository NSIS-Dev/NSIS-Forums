      hi!<br />
      <br />
      this is my question:<br />
      <br />
      i have an installer made with NSIS 1.98. it has 3 sections. is there a way to install (silent install) only 2 sections of 3 ?<br />
      <br />
      PS: i saw that unistall component now supports sections. is there an example ?<br />
      <br />
      thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Silent installers only install selected sections, that is, sections with the SF_SELECTED flag. It works just like normal installers, only you can't show the components page so you have to unselect them yourself using macros from section.nsh or simple scripting.<br />
      <br />
      Uninstall sections should start with the un. prefix, that's all you need to know. If you want a components page use UnisntPage components or PageEx un.components.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks kichik for the quick reply.<br />
      <br />
      can you be more specific on the silent install question ?<br />
      <br />
      for the uninstall part, you are right. that all i need to know.<br />
      but, why doesnt the unistall component take the sections from the install ? i mean if i have 3 section named "1" "2" "3", in the uninstall i should have the same sections. am i wrong ? or just did not understand what you were saying ? :rolleyes:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Use this in .onInit to unselect a section:<br />
      <br />
      !include Sections.nsh<br />
      !insertmacro UnselectSection ${aSecIDontWantInSiletMode}<br />
      <br />
      Use IfSilent to jump over this code if you want that section to be unselected only on silent installers.<br />
      <br />
      Installer and uninstaller sections are completely seperate, their number doesn't have to be the same and they don't have to be related. The last "new stuff.zip" attachment in <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=143458&amp;highlight=pageex" target="_blank">this thread</a> contains an example with more than one uninstaller section.</p>

      </blockquote>Oops, got confused because of the uninstaller sections question, thought you are using the latest CVS version...<br />
      <br />
      With 1.98 you'd have to do it the old fashioned way, which is checking if the user passed /S on the command line (use <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=79" target="_blank">this</a>), and if s/he did, skip the section by calling Return (all of this from within the section).

      <p class="post-content">i'm confused too...<br />
      <br />
      i do not have the script for the software i'm trying to install silent, it's something like "REDIST"...<br />
      <br />
      i will look later at the script in the arhive. thanks again.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh... Then in that case, unless the installer writer has implemented his own command line processing, you can't.</p>
