      <p class="post-content"><strong>Startmenu group</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      the actual NSIS 2 CVS is very good.<br />
      The new features are useful. (Mulitlanguage, Modern UI) :up:<br />
      <br />
      But we really need the ability to select a startmenu group in the setup now. Each setup has it, but not NSIS. :confused:<br />
      <br />
      It shouldn't be very difficult to create a selection like the one used in WISE Setup (look at the attached file from Opera Setup).<br />
      I created s.th. like this in 1.98 and it worked a bit (before learning C++). But I haven't managed to insert a new dialog and so it was useless. But if you can insert a new dialog and all routines to create and destroy it then I can perhaps implent this feature again. :D<br />
      <br />
      I posted a poll if the users need this feature. (I hope this'll work)<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">This could be done with InstallOptions plus a small dll that loops through the startmenu directory. If you want I could write one up.</p>

      Check it out <a href="http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/StartMenuDialogDemo" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
      It has been written in NSIS 1.98 and might need some changes to be compiled in NSIS 2.0ax but I did not check that.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      this looks good but it should be included in NSIS.<br />
      I think more than 50% need a dialog like this.<br />
      <br />
      Or it should be a plugin without the IO dialog, only a single DLL file.<br />
      Perhaps someone can do s.th. like this.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I guess that would increase the size of every installer, no matter you use it or not. In the current system you can choose to increase the size or not. I would prefer that.<br />
      <br />
      Or it should be possible to delete the resources when you dont need them. But then a lot of things should be included. Backgrounds, flash pictures etc... Let's leave it to KiCHiK and Justin then :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think it would be harder to put into NSIS than you think. A lot of scripts would be broken that write to the startmenu. Because then, it would be customizable, so it wouldn't know where to write it. What about the uninstaller? You would have to store the Folder Name in the registry. Plus, is it really necessary for the user to choose the name of the Start Menu group? For most installers no.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To partially play devil's advocate here, nobody really seemed to care about breaking installers previously to add features that were wanted. What's the issue with doing it again? This project is under active development, and it's expected that things are going to change. For people that want something set and stable, they should be using 1.98.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The main point is that we don't want to make NSIS larger adding a feature that many people won't use. There are so many other things that could have been integrated, but using Extension DLL's is really better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">HI kichik,<br />
      <br />
      I looked at StartMenu.dll and found a bug:<br />
      - If I show a MessageBox in the Example when the user<br />
      pressed cancel instead of the Quit-Command, then I get<br />
      the MessageBox but the dialog is empty. If I select No<br />
      then I come to the Directory-selection page.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Startmenu folder choice Not necessary</strong><br />
      My 2 cents worth :<br />
      Going by my own experience (as a user), I don't see the need for it.<br />
      <br />
      EVERY time I install a product, even when the choice is offered, I couldn't be bothered choosing at that time. I just let the installer put it where it wants, then, if I want to, I later reorganise it myself manually. I think if a user really cares about where it goes, they've probably taken the trouble to learn how to reorganise their startmenu programs. In fact, I actually prefer doing it that way. If I later move it myself from where the installer put it, the uninstaller can't remove the shortcuts when I uninstall the product. Then, I at least have a reminder left over about what was there (and where it was installed) even after it's gone, in case I want to reinstall it or something.</p>
