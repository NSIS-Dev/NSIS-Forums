      <p class="post-content"><strong>Progress bar during log operations</strong><br />
      Hi there!<br />
      <br />
      I'm pretty sure there must be some info/examples on the subject, but I failed to find any.<br />
      <br />
      Problem:<br />
      =========<br />
      In my installer, I have a custom page with the leave function, in which the whole Program Files/ content is analyzed recursively. Depending on the size of Program Files, this might be a quite lengthy process, and, as far as I block the thread, the installer GUI gets unresponsive.<br />
      <br />
      So, apparently, the leave function is executed in main message dispatchig thread. That's why the window isn't redrawn after overlapping with another one and so on...<br />
      <br />
      If it is so for, let's say, a couple of minutes, I think it's a serious usability issue.<br />
      =========<br />
      <br />
      What I'd like to have is some sort of a progress bar, or just %% indicator that shows something meaningfull to the user or, at least, make the gui alive while accomplishing the search.<br />
      <br />
      I'd appreciate if someone gave me some advice or reference to relevant thread/manual how to accomplish this.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance!<br />
      <br />
      Sergey</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you insert a short Sleep - does the UI then update?<br />
      <br />
      If the GUI doesn't update, a GUI progressbar - <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialogs_FAQ#How_to_Create_a_Marquee_.28endless_loop.29_Progress_Bar_control" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialog...ss_Bar_control</a> - might not do much either? What happens if you move it into a next dialog and kickstart the process automatically after a timer tick? Could even temporarily halt your recursing after N operations, create a new timer, and resume the recursing where it left off when it ticks.<br />
      <br />
      Short of those (and similar silliness).. for Win7, at least, you could set the taskbar button to a marquee style progress bar - <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Set_Taskbar_button_progress#.24.7BTBProgress_State.7D_Indeterminate" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Set_Task..._Indeterminate</a><br />
      <br />
      And you could try messing with the installer's caption.. that might update appropriately:<br />
