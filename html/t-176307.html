      <p class="post-content"><strong>don't understand concept of File</strong><br />
      Hi people I need some help on this. I don't understand the concept of the "File" command. (Even after reading the documentation.) Currently my installation does:<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      SetOutPath $TEMP<br />
      File "${FILENAME}"<br />
      Exec "${FILENAME}"<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      My question is, does the "File" command tell the compiler what file to include in the exe file, or does it tell the exe file where to extract?<br />
      <br />
      Currently my FILENAME constant holds the relative value "runme.bat" so it all goes well. But what if I want to run the compiler in another directory? So I set:<br />
      <br />
      !define FILENAME "c:\docs\runme.bat"<br />
      <br />
      and run:<br />
      <br />
      c:\My Documents\scripts\makensis.exe "c:\My Documents\scripts\dual.nsi"<br />
      <br />
      ? The file "runme.bat" still gets included in the exe file (as expected) but when I run it, is the file still extracted to $TEMP or is it extracted to "c:\docs\runme.bat" on the target computer?<br />
      How can I remedy this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It does both. It includes the file in the installer and it will extract it<br />
      to the directory set by SetOutPath.<br />
      <br />
      In this case, even if the file is located in another directory, it will still be extracted to $TEMP.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to extract to another folder on run-time without using SetOutPath, you can use the /oname parameter with a filename.</p>
