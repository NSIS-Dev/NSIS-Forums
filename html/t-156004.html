Setting up a lazy init in ECS seems to have fixed the problem:<br><br></p><pre>
<code><br>bool CriticalSectionInited=false;<br>CRITICAL_SECTION CriticalSection;<br><br>void ECS() {<br>        if (!CriticalSectionInited) {<br>                InitializeCriticalSection(&amp;CriticalSection);<br>                CriticalSectionInited = true;<br>        }<br>        EnterCriticalSection(&amp;CriticalSection);<br>}<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>BOOL WINAPI _DllMainCRTStartup(HINSTANCE hInst, ULONG ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) {<br>  g_hInstance=hInst;<br>  switch (ul_reason_for_call) {<br>    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:<br>          if (!CriticalSectionInited) {<br>                InitializeCriticalSection(&amp;CriticalSection);<br>                CriticalSectionInited = true;<br>          }<br>      break;<br></code>

      I admit I know *nothing* about DLLs, so there might be something else going wrong here, it seems odd to me that you'd get a function called before getting an ATTACH message, but this seems to have fixed my problem. Thanks for the great plugin!

      <p class="post-content">That's impossible.<br>
      <br>
      Something else must be happening. Mind attaching the script and some more details about the tested OS?<br>
      <br>
      Also, have you recompiled BgImage (before adding the patch)?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I am getting this behaviour in the Example.nsi that comes with BgImage (in the nsis.zip of recent CVS code). I simply built the debug version of BgImage.dll, copied it to my plugins/ folder, compiled the example, and it crashes immediately upon startup.<br>
      <br>
      I'm running Windows XP (latest patches), and the crash that I seem to have fixed only exhibited itself on some laptops (the crash was happening in the Destroy code, I believe, so I built the debug version to find out where, but since the debug just died instantly I was unable to track it down. Now after this change, it's working fine).<br>
      <br>
      If you are not getting this behaviour with the debug build let me know and I will try it on different computers to help track it down.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ah... That's because the debug build is not configured right. It doesn't even call _DllMainCRTStartup in the debug version :)<br>
      <br>
      I'll update that, thanks.<br>
      <br>
      For now, just #define _DllMainCRTStartup as DllMain if _DEBUG is defined and it should work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Problem "solved", it was because SetBg was called from a section. Documentation updated to state it shouldn't be done.<br>
