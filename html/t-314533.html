      Hi there,<br />
      <br />
      Well i've registered me 2... never thought it gonna to happen ;)<br />
      <br />
      I have read and looked and searched the web... BUT!... couldn't find the answer...<br />
      <br />
      I am working now a few months with NSIS.. ( and Eclipse! ) and i must say... love it!<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      But.. i have to post a question.. because i couldn't find the answer.<br />
      <br />
      I have multiple EXE files...<br />
      File1.exe = very much images<br />
      File2.exe = something else (like webshop information)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Now i must compile every EXE file again, when i "upgrade" it.. and place it online...<br />
      <br />
      I thought it was the best way.. to use VersionCompare... but.. How does it work?<br />
      <br />
      Or is it better to make a update program / patch program?<br />
      So.. i have in the Tray of windows a very tiny program.. that will check online if there is a new version?<br />
      <br />
      (I even looked at PHPECLIPSE ) but couldn't find the answer..<br />
      <br />
      I tried to make a cookie with NSIS.. but even that didn't work out...(then i can check online if cookie exists)<br />
      <br />
      ...anyway... how does it work?<br />
      I'm not lazy :) i will do my homework.. but i need help to get further...<br />
      <br />
      OR i must do something like version control... and look for updates? ( please explain how it works )<br />
      <br />
      OR i must open the browser with a link, for examples:<br />
      domain.com/checkversion.php?version=1.0.0<br />
      <br />
      Then i can write a php script on my website.. who will select the other updates for me... (PHP is better to write then NSIS ;) )<br />
      <br />
      Please help me with a solution...</p>

      <p class="post-content">your explanation are rather obscure...<br />
      <br />
      can you just explain simply the context and what you try to achieve ?</p>
