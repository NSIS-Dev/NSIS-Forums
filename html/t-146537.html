The software itself is actually two different packages; both of which use InstallShield installers. I'm using NSIS to chain them together. Both packages require reboots once finished, but they are not dependent on each other. Because of this, we can put off rebooting until both have been installed and effectively change two reboots down to one. I have NSIS perform a reboot at the end. However, I don't trust my users enough to select "No, I will reboot my computer later" when prompted both times by InstallShield.<br><br>I was wondering if anyone has any idea on how to force the installer to not reboot and not prompt the user (or at a minimum, prevent the system from being rebooted). I'm sure this is a long shot, but I thought I'd check anyway. Thanks in advance.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st August 2003 23:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">1) Maybe the reboot option of InstallShield can be diabled with a command line parameter.

The script is automatically answering no to the reboot question and NSIS is controlling it well.<br><br>I would really like to convert them both to NSIS, but I can't see where NSIS has support for installing services. The Services.dll plugin seems to only support operations on an already existing service. Is there any way to install services under NSIS?</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd August 2003 18:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">To install your application as a service, you have to add certain registry keys (HKLM, SYSTEM\Services).
