      <p class="post-content"><strong>plugin code question</strong><br />
      I am currently re-writing one of my plugins for nsis and I have a question. I am re-writing the bgimage plugin to suit my needs, and I have made the background window have a title bar and system controls (icon, minimize, maximize, and close). The window (not deing a dialog) has a default application icon instead of having the icon from the nsis installer. In the past I have included the icon in the installer and extracted it to the plugins dir, then the plugin loads the icon from the file.<br />
      <br />
      My question is can I load the icon from the nsis installer instead of from the file in the plugins dir. I have already tried loading the icon from the nsis installer with no luck.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ExtractIcon is the best way, but</p>
      <pre>
<code>LoadIcon(GetModuleHandle(NULL), MAKEINTRESOURCE(103)), 0);</code>
</pre>works as well ;)

      From msdn:<br />

      <blockquote>
        If this parameter is NULL, GetModuleHandle returns a handle to the file used to create the calling process (.exe file).

      <p class="post-content">I have another question. It is the same question I asked last year about moving a progress bar in my custom dialog, where the value is taken from the instfiles page progress bar. Kichik already gave a solution, but I don't know what subclassing is, and I don't know how to forward messages either. Giving an example .cpp and/or .rc file would be a big help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have managed to get it working but in a different way. I have noticed there are no PBM_SETPOS messages being sent during the install, so I used PBM_GETPOS and PBM_SETPOS in a window procedure so that it is redrawn whenever the windows procedure gets a message. Problem is that the progress bar does not always move with the installers progress bar. I have attached the test installer that illustrates this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have a code question, but it is not a plugin question :weird:. It is about the NSIS source code. I am trying to make a stub that has no compression support (smaller exehead, and I am bored :rolleyes: ).<br />
      <br />
      My question is: If the compiler encounters a 'SetCompress off' command,<br />
      can I skip the code in the '#ifdef NSIS_COMPRESSION_SUPPORT' and/or 'NSIS_COMPRESS_WHOLE' using a run-time variable? Would that work?<br />
      <br />
      I relise this requires no stub, but it is one of the easiest ways I can think of to have a smaller no compression exehead.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Compression code is already skipped if SetCompress off is used. When parsed, it sets a variable that's checked before compression. Simply set that variable and change the stub for a compression-less installer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Cool :cool: . Thanks for that. I have already modified the build system to build a compression-less stub, and now to put it all together.</p>
