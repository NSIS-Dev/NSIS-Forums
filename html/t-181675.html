Can't initialize plug-ins directory.</strong><br>i have an <a href="http://www.ipodsoft.com/downloads/googleget/googleget_setup.exe" target="_blank">installer</a> that runs perfectly on my system (and many others) but have had a report from one user of the following error message occuring as soon as the installer is executed:<br><br>"Error! Can't initialize plug-ins directory. Please try again later."<br><br>we're both on exactly the same os (windows xp pro sp1) so that can't be particularly relevant. now i did search the forums and manage to find <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=136943" target="_blank">one other user</a> reporting the same error message, however it was a really old message and kichik stated at the the end that that problem would be fixed soon.<br><br>so, does this same problem still exist in the latest version of nsis (i'm using 2.0 final, not a cvs build though) and if so i just thought i should point it out. if not, then what's causing this problem and how can i get it fixed?<br><br><br>thanks in advance<br><br>mark</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th May 2004 12:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Your problem is not related to the other topic. The plug-ins directory is a temporary directory for the installer.
