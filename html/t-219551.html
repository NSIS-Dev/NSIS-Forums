      <p class="post-content"><strong>Track start menu items</strong><br />
      Something that annoys me a lot is when a program adds new start menu items while they are already included from a previous installation. I have my start menu subdivided into different categories in which I place the start menu folder of a specific program. Because of this, when I e.g. update an existing program, it means that a new start menu folder of that program usually gets added again to the "root" of the start menu instead of it overwriting the old folder in a different location.<br />
      <br />
      Because of this I'm wondering if the following is possible with NSIS:<br />
      - A way for the user, during installation, to be able to specify a more accurate location (nested instead of just the "root") in which the installer should place the program folder in the start menu.<br />
      - A way to keep track of the folder location of a specific program to use when reinstalling/updating again.<br />
      - A way to detect a program folder in the start menu of a specific program (on reinstalling/updating) eventhough when it's not located in the "root".<br />
      <br />
      If this is possible already, e.g. by using the scripting language, why wouldn't it be used more often? Would it be something that should be made easier to use/do somehow?</p>

      <p class="post-content">All that requested stuff is already possible to do with nsis. Just take a look at the start menu example script "[..]\NSIS\Examples\Modern UI\StartMenu.nsi"<br />

      </blockquote>Because people dont know, are lazy or use another installer than nsis. Imho, the last reason is the worst :D.
