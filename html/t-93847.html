      <p class="post-content"><strong>Full color icon, XP style without recompiling and smaller header size</strong><br />
      &nbsp; I have worked on this for quite a while now, but it is finally ready :)<br />
      <br />
      This is a modification of NSIS 1.98.<br />
      <br />
      I have added:<br />
      <br />
      * Ability to add XP manifest without recompiling (XPStyle on)<br />
      * Support for all types of icons. Uninstall icon shuold still be the same structure as the installer icon, if used. You can even add an icon with 3 different sizes in it (this mod's installer includes one with 9).<br />
      * Stripping of unused resources from the exe header. For example, if you didn't use the license page, the license dialog resource will be stripped down resulting in an even smaller exe header.<br />
      * ${NSISDIR} - A constant holding the path in which NSIS is installed, on the compiler machine of course...<br />
      <br />
      I am suggesting this mod as NSIS 1.99.<br />
      <br />
      Sunjammer kindly helped me by hosting the file on his NSIS archive.<br />
      <br />
      You can download it from:<br />

      I hope you enjoy it :)<br />

      Using your mod I get an error using InstallColors. It worked with NSIS 1.98 but it doesn't work with yours.<br />
      <br />
      I'm using:<br />
      InstallColors 0066C8 000000<br />

      From MakeNSISW:<br />

      <br />
      Any knowledge as to why this occurs?</p>

      It was indeed a bug, and a very stupid one may I add...<br />
      I have fixed this bug and another one relating the default uninstall icon. I have also updated the makefiles (I hope I did it right...).<br />

      <p class="post-content">My patch doesn't ever remove the icon. I don't see any reason for it to fail. The icon is there. Did this work with NSIS 1.98? Maybe UPX compresses the icons as well. But then, how could Windows read them?<br />

      Please send me the script so I can look further into it.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT:<br />
      I think I know what is wrong. Maybe UPX compress all of the icon resource together, and doesn't align each raw data section size to 8 like my resource editor does.<br />
      <br />
      I will look into it, and if this is the case I will just rewrite the find_data_offset function to match this case.<br />

      Does it only happen when you add an icon file with more than one icon?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have found out what the problem is, and it is a pretty funny one :)<br />
      It seems UPX doesn't eliminate the space between icons, it adds more! :eek: Some compression eh?<br />
      <br />
      I won't make the fix today, maybe tomorrow. If anyone else wants to do it instead of me here is my idea (if you have a better one please post it):<br />
      The uninstaller icon data should be saved as an array of variable length entries. Each entry of the array would contain:<br />
      1) The size of the icon<br />
      2) The offset in which it should saved<br />
      3) The icon data itself<br />
      <br />
      generate_uninstall_icon_data would build this array and leave the offsets entries empty. After the file is compressed using UPX or whatever (which is the last the time the exe header can change) the offsets will be written into this array. To find the offsets you will have to write a function like get_addr_of_res.<br />
      <br />
      The function generating the uninstaller must change too (in the exe header).<br />
      <br />
      If all this is done it would be useless for get_addr_of_res to search for the icon offset, and to be called after each use of CResrouceEditor.<br />
      <br />
      If someone is ready to this please tell me. If I get no PMs/E-Mail until tomorrow I will do it my self.</p>

      You are a good programmer (or I am extraordinarily poor) and I must admit, I had a go at it and could not get it working very cleanly. Eventually I had to settle with not being able to add named entries, 'cause I just couldn't get them to work.<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, it is ready!<br />
      InstallColors, UPX, multiple icons, zlib and bz2. It all works now. This time I wrote the icons handling functions a bit more general so it should be able to handle even the craziest compiler/packer unless it compresses the icons (I hope :D ).<br />
      <br />
      I have also added an error message if the NSIS path could not be found in the registry. It does not stop compilation, but I at least now you will know why your include doesn't work.<br />

      </blockquote>That would probably make the installer look a bit weird. In it's current form, the installer is pretty much simple and small in size. Adding a branding image will also make the installer size much larger and i think NSIS looks great at the moment. If you're looking for an installer that supports branding, try Inno Setup instead - <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org" target="_blank">www.jrsoftware.org</a>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah but you could do a switch so that if you don't include it in your nsi file it won't use the coding for it or if you put in your nsi file BrandImage off.<br />
      <br />
      I just think it'll be a nice addition to NSIS which most people would like to use say like if the installer is over 50mb or something you wouldn't notice much difference in size.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi Target,<br />
      <br />
      I will do it. I was thinking of doing it with the first version but I had a problem with bitmaps...<br />
      <br />
      To mlbl, I will make it so the header size won't change. Don't worry, it is just a couple of lines of code...<br />
      <br />

      [edit]I have just noticed that Sunjammer has uploaded the new version with the Enabled/Disabled bitmap bug fixed.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks Sunjammer[/edit]</p>

      <p class="post-content">A new version is out:<br />
      <br />
      - Full color bitmap for EnabledBitmap/DisabledBitmap are now supported. Bitmap size <b>MUST</b> be 20x20 now though... I hope that doesn't break anyone's script<br />
      - Code now compiles and works with Borland compiler (would somone mind checking it on mingw too?)<br />
      - Fixed a bug that caused makensis to crash if uninstall section was present and WriteUninstaller wasn't. Also made it so the uninstaller data won't be added unless WriteUninstaller was called.<br />
      <br />
      For Borland copmiler users:<br />
      1) To compile my mod you need to change the current makefile and get it to compile ResourceEditor.cpp too.<br />
      2) If you want to make your Borland compiled NSIS even smaller you can remove any resources of the RCData type (using Resource Hacker or another resource editor), and remove the .reloc section (using <a href="http://crayzee.cjb.net" target="_blank">crayzee's wipe.reloc v1.40</a> or another aligner/wiper). UPX does a good job as well.<br />
      <br />
      I think that branding image support will take a little longer to make than I have thought in the first place. It is a little complicated... I will try to find some code on the Internet, but if I fail I will have to write it my-self and it will take some time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The problem with this mod is that it forces you to use branding image. I don't want to do that. I want to give it as an option.<br />
      To do this I need to learn how to edit dialog resources. And of course, like everything else with Microsoft, it isn't that simple...<br />
      I haven't found any class/code that already does this so I guess I will have to write my own class. I hope it won't take too long. If I write this class I will be able to implement font changing as well.</p>
