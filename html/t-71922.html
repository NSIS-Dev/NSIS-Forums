I've attached the source and executables. The wrapper works well when you use it with the extensions (you just need to update them to makensisw.exe and makensis-bz2w.exe).<br><br>The only part of the nsis source I changed was moving the NSIS-VERSION string into version.c so I could retrieve the nsis version. The wrapper is in source/makensisw. The makefile is for mingw so you'll have to write your own for v c++.<br><br>To install, extract the zip file you your nsis directory. To install/upgrade the extensions, run makensis on the installext.nsi file and run the installer.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">rainwater</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th January 2002 18:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Here's an updated version that does not need to be compiled for each makensis (makensis.exe, makensis-bz2.exe, etc).
