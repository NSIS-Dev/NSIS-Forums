      <p class="post-content">A NT service is a special type of application, you can't just run any program as a service.<br />
      <br />
      But if you want to force a non service app to run as a service, there was a tool that did this in one of the NT resource kits.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Adding to the services registry is not enough and you haven't answered Anders' question... Is your application an actual service executable? If it isn't then you must use Srvany.exe (from the Windows NT Resource Kit) but that is lazy if you ask me. To create and delete services you can use a plug-in such as SimpleSC.<br />

      <p class="post-content">To elaborate further, if you just want your application to start on login, you use the Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry under HKCU or HKLM.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>creating service</strong><br />
      hi,<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      i am creating an application in java swings, create an exe using the Xenoage software(used to convert jar 2 exe).<br />
      <br />
      I used the SimpleSC.dll. I download and copied in my NSIS Plugins application path, as per the instruction given.<br />
      <br />
      I created the service and it is added in the the <b>"Services"</b> but i can't able to start the service. I kept the service start as automatic, it is not starting. Manually also i tried but it is not starting.</p>

      Edit: And for the record, if you want to show a user interface in your service, you cannot on Windows Vista and upwards. For older versions of Windows you must use the SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS service type flag or programmatically launch your UI process under the current user with CreateProcessAsUser.<br />
