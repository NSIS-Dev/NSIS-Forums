      <p class="post-content"><strong>Split Installer</strong><br />
      Hello ;)<br />
      I just wanted to compile my installer, but i got the compiler error #12345.<br />
      I found out, that it's because the files are bigger than 2GB.<br />
      <br />
      How can i split the files into 2 files?<br />
      For example:<br />
      setup.exe (&lt;2GB)<br />
      data.zip (the rest)<br />
      <br />
      So the installer uses the zip to unpack the rest of the files...<br />
      <br />
      greets,<br />

      Thanks again :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">You should probably be aware that the compression in .CAB files sucks. The algorithm hasn't been changed since Windows 95 (3.x?). You're probably better off using 7-zip compression, plus if you use 7-zip compression and you need a good way to handle licensing for your program, you can encrypt the archives using the users' registration key.<br />

      <p class="post-content">splitting into 2gb+rest files is really usefull if you want to download it from web &lt;sncr&gt;<br />
      <br />
      and for dvd it makes no sense.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the compression isnt really important!<br />
      it's only for some friends ;) and i just saw, that the files are exactly 4.7GB, so i can burn it on dvd :D<br />
      <br />
      okay, i'll try 7zip too ;) thanks for your answers</p>

      <p class="post-content">Compared to 7-Zip compression, the LZMA compression used in CAB files can be poor, for some files.<br />
      <br />
      Files that are going to compress well or poorly are likely to do so regardless of the algorithm used (try comparing compressing already compressed files using two different archive programs, the difference is likely to be &lt; 5%.) Across a couple of CDs or DVDs, this isn't likely to matter.<br />
      <br />
      If conserving space is of major concern, use 7-Zip to compress the files and CABSetup to contain the resulting archives to manage the disk handling; I have seen modern installers do this type of action where they use InstallShield to carry the files and use some other software to unpack them once they are on the user's hard drive.<br />
      <br />
      I could modify CABSetup to enable the caller to turn compression off so files are not double-compressed to support this behaviour. (In fact, it sounds like a handy option, so I think I will do it anyway.)<br />
      <br />
      Microsoft MSI installers use the same library functions that CABSetup does to compress their file databases; that was one of the reasons for using them for the plug-in - to give NSIS a capability it didn't have, using something that was likely to have support (at least on the Windows platforms.)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, the next release of CABSetup is soon, I have spent the last couple of days ironing out a few bugs - the change has been substantial, and should be a big improvement on version 1.1.<br />
