      </blockquote>You are getting '0' because the function fails. If you call it using the '?e' switch and pop the value onto $2 then you will get more information about that error. My guess is that you are trying to unload something which is in use, but you will have to get the error value from $2 and find what the actual error is from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/debug/base/system_error_codes.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

<code>System::Call "user32::GetKeyboardLayout(i 0x0) i .r0"<br />System::Call "user32::UnloadKeyboardLayout(i r0) i .r1 ?e"<br />Pop $2</code>
</pre>The UnloadKeyboardLayout fails and gives you $1=0. If you run it as shown above, it will give you extended error information on $2. What is the value of $2? Look it up on the MSDN windows error codes <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/debug/base/system_error_codes.asp" target="_blank">page</a>. Then you will have a clue as to why the call fails. My guess is that you have only a single keyboard layout and you are trying to unload it (so you may need to load a new one with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardinput/keyboardinputreference/keyboardinputfunctions/loadkeyboardlayout.asp" target="_blank">LoadKeyboardLayout</a>), <b>or</b> you have multiple layouts but you are trying to unload one that is in use. Check the value of $2 and then we can figure out what's going on.<br />

</pre><br />
      <br />
      I can load the French and Greek keyboard layouts that I tried and they do appear at the language bar. I can also use CTRL+SHIFT to change between keyboard layouts. Once I unload them they disappear from the language bar as well :)<br />
      <br />
      The idea is that you can load as many layouts as you want. Use ActivateKeyboardLayout to activate any of them and then use it in your application. If you call UnloadKeyboardLayout then the layout will be gone from the language bar (ie you will not be able to activate it using CTRL-SHIFT or any other combination)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I kind of liked the idea of loading keyboard layouts and wrote a small macro that will do just that.

      <p class="post-content">Both methods do the same thing. Both methods work for me. They both load a new keyboard layout and activate it. I am able to cycle through multiple layouts using CTRL-SHIFT. I am also using XP Pro and both methods should work on NT/2000/XP/2k3 (tested it in 2k as well and it is working fine).<br />
      <br />
      You do reallize that the code provided here will add the languages to the current thread, but it will <b>not</b> 'make' the language bar appear, ie you need to have at least two layouts active <u>before</u> running this code, with the language bar visible so that you will see the new layouts. Also this code will <b>not</b> add a hotkey combination in order to cycle through the layouts, this is something that you should do prior to running the code.<br />
      <br />
      What language are you trying to load? Running the last macro I posted for 0x040a (if that's what you are trying to load) I get a Spanish layout loaded.<br />
