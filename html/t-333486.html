      <p class="post-content"><strong>How do I retrieve that last checkbox that was checked?</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      <br />
      I have a whole set of sections and subsections in my components page. For example,<br />
      <br />
      - SectionGroup: CNCRouter<br />
      --- Section Subgroup: Vision<br />
      --- ........<br />
      --- ........<br />
      - SectionGroup: Other kind of Router<br />
      - SectionGroup: .......<br />
      - ........<br />
      - SectionGroup: Drivers and Utilities<br />
      --- Section Subgroup: Router Driver<br />
      --- Section Subgroup: Vision Driver<br />
      <br />
      Depending on the selection I choose, some other section/subsection will be selected, other will be deselected, and other ignored. For example, if I choose CNCRouter, it will choose CNC Router Driver and Vision Driver. How can I know which one was the last checkbox chosen?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Jaime</p>

      <p class="post-content">...I've no idea why you'd want to know which section was enabled the last... But you can do it by setting some variables in .onSelChange.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, my installer has several products from which the user can choose from, and I want to limit the user to only install one product every time that the installer is run.<br />
      <br />
      Knowing the last checked checkbox, it will allow me to make sure that all other sections and subsections are deselected.<br />
      <br />
      MSG, .onSelChange is what I was looking for.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the help.</p>
