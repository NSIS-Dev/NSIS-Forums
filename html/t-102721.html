Installed NSIS 2a7<br>2. Copied "makensis.exe" and the "plugins" directory elsewhere<br>3. Tried to compile a script from the command-line, by running the "makensis.exe" that is outside $NSISDIR<br>4. Got an access violation after the compiler wrote:<br>Processing plugin dlls: "C:\&lt;...the new directory...&gt;\plugins\*.dll"<br><br>Notes:<br>* the DLLs I'm using in the script are naturally all in the plugins dir<br>* I tried both using and not using the "PluginDir" command - same results<br>* If it's any help, I used only absolute paths, with no whitespaces<br>* When I run the makensis.exe in the original installation path the compilation works<br><br>Is there some silly newbie mistake I'm not aware of?<br><br>Now secondly, I've been wanting to express my sincere and complete gratidue to all of the NSIS developers and contributors. I usually don't like to write in public forums "fluff" that doesn't serve a specific purpose, but NSIS is simply a remarkable piece of software:<br>* Functionality that equals any other related product<br>* Learning curve easier in comparison to any other commercial product<br>* Good reliability across many platorms (95 to XP) - again something that most of the professional installation makers cannot guarantee<br>* Great customization capabitilies (and keeps getting better)<br>* Continuous and useful support from the user community<br>* Absolutely free for absolutely any purpose<br><br>Great work!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st August 2002 14:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I have committed another version of makensisw to the CVS.<br>If it does not solve these bugs, it will at least faster than before.
