      <p class="post-content"><strong>Version 2.0 and Vista</strong><br />
      Hi there,<br />
      <br />
      I am updateing and developing an installer that was once used in windows 2k/xp. I am currently using version 2.0 and was wondering if it was compatable with VISTA. It is a rather complex installer and I havn't found enough information to know if I updated to the newest version if its going to work.<br />
      I know checking to see if windows vista is teh current OS will NOT work but I may be able to get around that by checking for most others an not allowing an install on those operating systems. Has anyone ran into a lot of issues with an older version of NSIS and installing on vista?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      <br />
      Ryan</p>

      <p class="post-content">It will, largely, depend on your installer and what you're installing...<br />
      <br />
      For example..if your installer needs Administrator rights (or whatever rights above that of a regular user), you'll want to get a newer version with which you can set the execution level of the installer; Vista will pop up the appropriate UAC prompt, etc.<br />
      <br />
      If your installer may be installing something for 64bit vista (this applies to XP64 as well, of course), you'll probably also want a newer version, as you can set whether you want to read/write to 32bit or 64bit registry with it.<br />
      <br />
      The installer I work on doesn't need admin rights and worked in Vista right off the bat. Currently, its 64bit software installer doesn't switch registries yet (the software it installs doesn't depend on any values the installer sets, so it doesn't matter), but we'll probably upgrade soon so that we can at least adhere to proper standards there :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The installer itself has an Oracle 8.0, Java, Adobe Reader, installer built in as well. I know that our software and Orcale require adminrights and Registry rights, so I am going to need to update for sure.<br />
      <br />
      I guess teh other question would be, can an old 2.0 installer compile in the new updated version of the installer?(can't test that right now cause we have a final release and no extra computers to test it on)Have any commands been depricated, removed, or drastically changed?<br />
      Thanks for you initial input.</p>
