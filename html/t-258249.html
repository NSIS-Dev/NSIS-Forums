      <p class="post-content"><strong>Please help me in InstallOptions</strong><br />
      I am studying about InstallOptions. However, I have many problem which I can not understand when read on manual.<br />
      If somebody know, please explain to me!!!<br />
      <br />
      + I try to read this but still not know<br />
      <font color="blue">InstallOptions::dialog "$PLUGINSDIR\menu_1.ini"</font><br />
      Because in file testlink.nsi on example use this<br />
      <font color="blur">InstallOptions::dialog "$PLUGINSDIR\<b>test.ini</b>"</font><br />
      But test.ini is a different file.Why in file <b>TESTLINK.NSI</b> uses file <b>TEST.INI</b><br />
      <br />
      + I want to show icon on menu. I also depend on these file help on example but I do not know why it do not display.<br />
      <br />
      + I use test link in my menu but I want to change state of string which I want to click.I mean: when user only can click on one attribute and the other is disable. The first attribute is installed, the second attribute will be clicked but I do not work.<br />
      <br />
      + In my menu, I want to change position two button "Exit and View ReadMe" near together. But in example folder, there are not a few example for me.In addition, I want to show file read me which I do not need to close my main application.How can I do that?<br />
      <br />
      This is the first time I use installoptions, may my question be stupid but I can not find out my answer?<br />
      Consequently, I hope everyone who use InstallOptions help me in this field.<br />
      I also enclose these file which is related,<br />
      My attachment include "menu.nsi,menu_1.ini,setmenu.exe"<br />
      Your help is really appreaciated!!!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">testlink.nsi uses $PLUGINSDIR\TEST.INI because that's the name it uses extracts testlink.ini. See its .onInit function.<br />
      <br />
      testimgs.nsi shows you how to display images and icons in a custom page.<br />
      <br />
      I don't understand your questions about the two links. Do you want to disable a link? What exactly doesn't work? Doesn't adding DISABLED to Flags work?<br />
      <br />
      What's exactly the problems with setting the positions of two texts?</p>

      </blockquote>I do not know exactly why in file testlink.nsi we must test.ini.If test.ini extract InstallOptions,I can chang this file to another file ????I mean I will change:<br />
      From: <font color="red">$PLUGINSDIR\TEST.INI</font><br />
      To : <font color="orange">$PLUGINSDIR\TEST.INI</font><br />
      <br />
      On the other hand, I want to change positon of button in file<br />
      Eg:<br />
      The default is Cancel, Next, Back. I want it to become <b>View ReadMe and Exit</b><br />
      Can I move them to go the other positon and change them?<br />
      If there is a click on Next or Back (it means now View ReadMe and Exit) how can I know it because I need these event on this to show file readme if they click View ReadMe or exit.<br />
      Thank you for your help,

      <p class="post-content">Nothing stops you from extracting the file as DETECT.INI. The INI file can be named anyway you wish.<br />
      <br />
      To change the buttons text use BackButtonText, NextButtonText, and CancelButtonText in the INI file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The leave callback function is called once the next button is clicked. You can show the readme there or you can show it after the call to InstallOptions. If you show it after the call to InstallOptions, you won't be able to call Abort to keep the user in the current page. That can only be done in the leave function.</p>
