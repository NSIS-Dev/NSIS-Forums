      <p class="post-content"><strong>Finish page cancel button</strong><br />
      Currently, the MUI enables the cancel button on the finish page, if it contains checkboxes. If the user clicks the cancel button, the checkboxes are ignored. Some users, including <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1267491&amp;group_id=22049&amp;atid=373085" target="_blank">bug report #1267491</a>, have complained and said this might confuse the user.<br />
      <br />
      In a way, it does make sense to have the cancel button enabled. It's a much more convenient way to skip whatever the finish page has to offer. Be it running an application, showing a web page or even restarting, hitting cancel is quicker than unchecking boxes and changing radio button selections.<br />
      <br />
      However, it might be confusing, making the user think he has a chance to cancel the installation, even though the finish page says the installation was completed.<br />
      <br />
      So, what do you think?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I voted "Never", because I think it will be very difficult to explain on the button caption that it quits the installer, ignoring the checked boxes. I'm all for the last option if anyone has a good idea, though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">voted for "Never" as it is very handy but unusual and most users wont understand it.<br />
      <br />
      i think we have the time to uncheck checkboxes.<br />
      <br />
      what about adding a define to let coders choose if they want the additional button or not?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm all for a define myself... in lieu of coders adding the 2-3 lines of code required to make changes manually. Changing the caption of the button / disabling it / hiding it isn't rocket science - it would just have to be documented.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd prefer a consistent behavior for all installers. If users get different things for different installers it becomes even more complex. Looking at the votes and the behavior of other installers, I think it should be disabled.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I did some (admittedly limited) testing with some other installers; here's what I encountered:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Wise (Ad-Aware SE Personal): disables Cancel button</li>

        <li>InstallShield (MS AntiSpyware): disables Cancel button</li>

        <li>&lt;No branding text&gt; (SpyBot S&amp;D): hides Cancel button</li>

        <li>Inno Setup (itself): hides Cancel button</li>
      </ul>So I think my vote is to never enable the Cancel button on the Finish page.

      <p class="post-content">In my UI, I have it so that the cancel button is always disabled. BTW, the first full version of InstallSpider should be out sometime this week, just have to finish writing the docs :( (which will take awhile because of all the new macros I have added to the UI).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Finally implemented. The X button is now disabled when the Cancel button is disabled and the finish page has the Cancel button disabled by default. MUI_FINISHPAGE_CANCEL_ENABLED can be defined to restore the old behavior.</p>
