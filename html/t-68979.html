It's probably in some license agreement you click on when you install. (I've never used it for anything other than my own testing tools, so I've never really looked that close at the license.)<br><br><blockquote>Thank you again - I didn't know about these.

I'm guessing they probably both work much the same. I'd look over the docs for each and see which one give you the most of what you need.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2008 18:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I would recommend the Simple Service Plugin as I use it myself in many major installations.<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">nsnb</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2008 20:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Afrow UK</i><br><b>I would recommend the Simple Service Plugin as I use it myself in many major installations.</b></blockquote>Thank you, Stu.
