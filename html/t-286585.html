Unfortunately, this is not a feature in AVG Free (reportedly it is in the commercial version of AVG).<br>In lieu of that - always make sure the scanner quarantaines files (or asks what you want to do), rather than outright deleting them, so that you can restore any false positive files.<br><br>And, of course, if you're not sure - use online virus scanning resources to scan detected files again. If they say the file is clean, you should probably be okay. If you're extra-careful, wait a day or few days, then scan again. Either the false positive will then be gone, or the online scanners might detect it as well (if it really is a infected).<br><br>Viruses are nasty - 'fraid we'll have to live with them, and all the pains that go with stopping them as much as possible; similar to spam.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th February 2008 15:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">@Animaether: Agree in those apps that you can find underground sites, downloaded via p2p, etc., but this nsis, many people use it.
