User can stop 100 MB download using Esc without Tasks Manager in the Banner mode (no Cancel button). NSIS installer handles Esc in the same manner - you can test this on your installer's Welcome page.<br>A.: no way to lock Esc in the curent InetLoad version. No problem to add a code locking Esc using WM_SYSCOMMAND and SC_CLOSE, but I am not sure this is really need. But you can add this functionality to your private build - source code is available. You can also check a resulting string - this case plug-in pushes to stack "Cancelled".</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MichaelFlya</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2005 18:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I noticed when doing multiple download paths, while one<br>is downloading if you press the enter key it skips to the<br>next download.
