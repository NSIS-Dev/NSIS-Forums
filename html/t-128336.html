I have included the DEP file. If you can make out what I was trying to convey that is great.<br><br>the extention of this file was supposed to be .DEP but VBB will only let you upload certian file-types. so I renamed it to TXT.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th March 2003 21:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well.. for example..I use Visual Basic 6.
