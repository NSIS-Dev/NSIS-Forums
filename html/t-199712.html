      <p class="post-content"><strong>Need help w/ files copy (loop?)</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hello all. What I need to do is copy a bunch of *.mdb files out of an unknown number of folders of which I do not know the name of (I know what your saying, this sounds fun already!). I tried the following, and it did not work, but I think it will give you the idea of what I’m trying to do.<br />
      <br />
      CopyFiles "c:\source\*\*.mdb" "C:\destination\"<br />
      <br />
      The first * in the above line is my problem. I don't know the name of the folders in the "source" directory, and I don't know how many there are. I only know there is 1 .mdb file in each folder.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know much about push, pop, and the stack, but it seems to me a loop could first be set up to read in (push) in each of the folder names in the "source" directory into the stack. Then a second loop could run that would pop the stack 1 at a time to set the $0 variable. The CopyFiles command would run after each pop, until the stack was empty, like this.<br />
      <br />
      CopyFiles "c:\source\$0\*.mdb" "C:\destination\"<br />
      <br />
      Would this work? Any help, or code examples would be great. Thanks all.</p>

      <blockquote>
        CopyFiles "c:\source\*\*.mdb" "C:\destination\"
      </blockquote>I think no matter how you eventually get it to work, the above is going to be the most intuitive syntax for accomplishing your task. Maybe, if you ask nicely, the developers will add support for multiple wildcards.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      For now, here's something that might work. I'm not sure if the "C:\source\*.*" part will match directories in C:\source\ as well as files, but if it's consistent with the rest of the scripting language it should (e.g. File /r "C:\source\*.*").<br />
      <br />
      Push $0<br />
      Push $1<br />
      FindFirst $0 $1 "C:\source\*.*"<br />
      loop:<br />
      StrCmp $1 "" done<br />
      CopyFiles "$1\*.mdb" "C:\destination\"<br />
      FindNext $0 $1<br />
      Goto loop<br />
      done:<br />
      Pop $1<br />
      Pop $0

      <p class="post-content">Some remarks :)<br />
      First of all we are talking about files copy on user's comp (CopyFiles parameter is filespec_on_destsys).<br />
      Pop and Push are optional - if you want to save vars content.<br />
      Folder names may not inclide ".", so original syntax "*" looks better for me then "*.*"<br />
      FindFirst/Next also finds "." and ".."<br />
      If your source folder may include files, you need to check that name is directory, not file.<br />
      This works but with pauses, may be I forgot something :) ?<br />

      <p class="post-content">You missed FindClose $0 at the end. It's always a good idea to use Push and Pop's no matter how small the code may be. Otherwise new people tend to wonder why their variable datas have changed.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey guys, I was wondering if someone could check this for a bug. The code below is working perfectly, however on my Win2K Pro workstation, I get the 3-4 second pause during execution as Takhir was talking about. I get no pause at home on my XP Pro PC. I have isolated the pause to the "CopyFiles" line. I put a message box before and after that line, that’s where the pause is. It seems there is about a 1 second pause each time that line is hit, so for a loop of 70 folders, that’s a really long pause. Any help would be most appreciated.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Have you checked that the $DestFolder exists already?<br />
      You should also use IfErrors to check when FindNext has finished:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Jnuw, looking from my corner situation is following: MS forgot Sleep(1 sec) in the SHFileOperation API call (Win98 and Win2K, not WinXP). I see 3 ways:<br />
      1) try to create second findfile-filecopy loop for mdb files and do copy using NSIS CopyFiles (for single file - not tested) or using System plug-in and CopyFile() API call.<br />
      2) Wait a little - may be NSIS developers can do something with this in exec.c file (current version or 2.03?).<br />
      3) write a plug-in (C program).</p>
