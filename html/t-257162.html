How can we make our program to run my sql first our program? It means if the OS does not have my sql,I will set up this program. In NullSoft, I do not know where to put my sql program to run before the main software. Because my sql is necessary for the main software.<br>If I seperate my sql and my software, It is not useful for user my program. I try to find it out, but I still don't understand it. Can you help me?<br>I also want to study more about NullSoft but I do not have more except help file.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
