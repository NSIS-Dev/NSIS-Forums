First, I would like to express my gratitude for such a nice installer package! Second, I have searched for the answer to my question and did not find it. Here, then, is the question:<br><br>I am installing a server that always runs. So, when uninstalling, I use the /REBOOTOK option for the program executable. That works very well. However, I also need to delete the directory the executable is in and, optionally, its parent directory. So I do:<br><br>Delete /REBOOTOK $INSTDIR\program.exe<br>; MUST REMOVE UNINSTALLER, too<br>Delete $INSTDIR\uninstall.exe<br>; remove directories used.<br>RMDir /r "$INSTDIR"<br>RMDir "$PROGRAMFILES\Company Name"<br><br>(The "Company Name" is the parent directory of $INSTDIR). The problem is the directories do not get deleted because program.exe is still running, so it is deleted upon reboot. I tried to specify /REBOOTOK after the RMDir, but the compiler smote me.<br><br>If there is a way to have these directories removed on reboot (with the "Company Name" one only if nothing else is left inside it), please let me know.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Adam</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Smile2Me</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th February 2003 07:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">As far as I know, there is no possibility to do this directly. However, you could make a small separate exe that you put in the temp dir at uninstall and let that execute at startup, so put a shortcut in $SMSTARTUP or a regentry in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. Then this program could perform some last minute tasks and delete the regentry/shortcut. It cannot delete itself, but since it is in the temp dir it doesn't harm that much and the user will delete himself after some time (when cleaning the comp).<br><br>Hope this helps. It has been discussed before (as far as I can remember), but can't find that anymore.<br><br>Good luck,<br>-Hendri.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th February 2003 10:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">RMDir /REBOOTOK is now on the todo list.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Prince</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th February 2003 14:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks, both of you.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Prince</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd March 2003 01:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I ended up with a workaround. Strangely, it works for one program but not for another. They are both running at the time of the uninstall, so there should be no difference.<br><br>Anyway, I thought perhaps others might find it useful, so here is what I did:<br><br></p><blockquote>GetTempfileName $0<br>Delete $0<br>Rename "$INSTDIR\foo.exe" $0<br>Delete /REBOOTOK $0<br>; If that did not work, delete it from its directory<br>IfFileExists "$INSTDIR\foo.exe" "" "bar"<br>Delete /REBOOTOK "$INSTDIR\foo.exe"<br>bar:<br>RMDir /r "$INSTDIR"</blockquote></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
