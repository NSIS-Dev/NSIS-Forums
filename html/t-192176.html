      <p class="post-content">Thanx!<br>
      <br>
      BTW, I did spend a great deal of time searching the forum. Probably more that my employer would have liked me spending. :D<br>

      Thanks again.<br>

      <p class="post-content">I had to put this one down for a while so I didn't get a chance to test it.<br>
      <br>
      the "/oname=$PLUGINSDIR\" parameter will only allows one file to be copied at a time, so I don't think I can use this because the Access Runtime installer has great number of files and directories.<br>
      <br>
      So, to re-state my original question:<br>
      Is there a better or recommended way of doing this?<br>
      <br>
      If not, I'll just copy the directory structure manaually - a pain, but what can you do...<br>

      <p class="post-content">have a look at the docs.<br>
      search them for the "File" command.<br>
      it has more switches than just the "/oname=" ...</p>
