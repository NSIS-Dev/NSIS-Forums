      <p class="post-content"><strong>Including a branding image in an installer</strong><br />
      I've been teaching myself NSIS all day today but I cam across a problem I can't see to fix. Is there a way to include a branding image in the install file but not extract it on install? Essentially I want to have 1 .exe I can distribute taht will have the file in it.<br />
      <br />
      The only method I can think of is to output the file and then delete it when I'm done but I don't want that to show up in the log file.<br />
      <br />
      Any help would be appreciated.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">it won't show up in the log file, because you can't extract it in a section but have to extract it in .oninit and delete it in .onGUIEnd</p>

      <p class="post-content">erm, sure that $PLUGINSDIR gets cleared automatically?<br />
      i always delete my self-extracted files myself, because i experienced that nsis does NOT clear the $PLUGINSDIR itself.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It clears it and whatever it can't delete (in-use plug-ins for example), it queues for deletion on reboot.</p>

      I just extracted it into the TEMP-Directory and deleted it afterwards again. It works perfectly ;)<br />
      <br />
      Now of course it's very easy to do this - you just have to get this idea :) perhaps a "IncludeBrandingImage" or something can be implemented in future versions, though...</p>
