      <p class="post-content"><strong>linking clients with servers on the fly!</strong><br />
      folks:<br />
      <br />
      i'm going to be distributing a client to users as they download it to their computer. I'd like to link the client to the server using a unique identifier that will already be stored in the database (i.e. the user has already signed and stored in the db when they go to download the application).<br />
      <br />
      i have already used nsis to create a setup.exe that installs my application. i am compressing it as well using the best compression.<br />
      <br />
      the servers will be linux and running sql or something...<br />
      <br />
      i'd like the client to know what it's unique identifier is *when the user downloads the software*<br />
      <br />
      my questions:<br />
      1) is there a way of including the # on the fly inside the compressed .exe file..? i.e. to have a placeholder inside the .exe that i could just textually replace on every download?<br />
      2) are there any other elegant ways of doing this? how would they work in lay man's terms? :P<br />
      3) i suppose i could run the nsis thing each time the user wants to download the client, and include this special # within the applciation directory, but i'd rather not...<br />
      <br />
      help!<br />
      <br />
      thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">One option would be to create a cookie and read somehow from the installer. Even though NSIS has a $COOKIES constant for the IE cookies folder, the user may well be using other web browsers.<br />
      <br />
      Another option would be to temporarily store their IP address in the database. You'd need to have a server-side executable written in PHP or Perl (etc), which your installer would query with the InetLoad plugin passing the users' IP address to it.<br />
