      <p class="post-content"><strong>multiple files - multiple includes and defines - confusion</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      There has to be a standard way to do this, but I just can't find it...<br />
      <br />
      Its the standard multiple include/define problem that you see in C, where I am getting things multiply defined/included.<br />
      <br />
      I am trying to split up my installer source code to have multiple source files, very much like MUI2 does with its Pages.<br />
      <br />
      Lets say I have main.nsi, file1.nsh, file2.nsh and file3.nsh<br />
      <br />
      main.nsi includes file1.nsh, file2.nsh and file3.nsh<br />
      <br />
      Now, lets say that file1.nsh needs to use StrTrimNewLines... So I include StrFunc.nsh...<br />
      Like:<br />
      !include "StrFunc.nsh"<br />
      ${UnStrTrimNewLines}<br />
      <br />
      Thats fine...<br />
      But oh wait, now I also need to include it in main.nsh as well.<br />
      If I try to do the include again there, I get errors. Presumably this is because I am including and defining a function twice...<br />
      <br />
      Okay, so perhaps I can do the usual trick under C, which is to check to see if something is defined, and only include the header file if its not defined yet...<br />
      However, this doesn't seem to work either...<br />
      <br />
      What is the typical way to solve this problem with NSIS?<br />
      <br />
      Yes, I know I could include it just once in main.nsi, and then include my file1.nsh and file2.nsh files below that... But I don't want to do that, because then file1.nsi and file2.nsi isn't "standalone", but instead requires someone above it to include things for it... Which I don't want...<br />

      <p class="post-content">I usually define something in the beginning and then wrap the entire NSH code inside a !if statment. (Many of the included files with NSIS do the same.)<br />
      <br />
      Use File1.nsh as an example. You'd do something like this:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />!ifndef File1_Included<br />   !define File1_included<br />   ...<br />   [your code here]<br />   ...<br />!endif<br /></code>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I tried that as well, but the problem is that the macro's are actually being inserted in both files.<br />
      Thus it ends up having the same function defined twice!<br />
      <br />
      Like my example above:<br />
      <br />
      If I do this at the top of file1.nsh:<br />
      !include "StrFunc.nsh"<br />
      ${UnStrTrimNewLines}<br />
      <br />
      Which I have to do, because this file actually requires the UnStrTrimNewLines function.<br />
      So this ends up inserting the function into file1.nsh.<br />
      <br />
      But what happens if I need the same function in main.nsi ?<br />
      If I do the:<br />
      !include "StrFunc.nsh"<br />
      ${UnStrTrimNewLines}<br />
      <br />
      This will insert the function yet again, but this time into my main.nsi file.<br />
      <br />
      So now, if main.nsi !include's file1.nsh, I have a duplicate function name of UnStrTrimNewLines...<br />
      <br />
      How the heck do you resolve this problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Bit ugly but should work:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />!include StrFunc.nsh<br />!if `${UnStrTrimNewLines}` == `!insertmacro FUNCTION_STRING_UnStrTrimNewLines`<br />  ${UnStrTrimNewLines}<br />!endif<br /></code>

      <p class="post-content">Hi Stu,<br />
      <br />
      Wow! That actually works PERFECTLY!<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your help on this one, I was expecting to have to spend the greater part of today trying to find a way around this problem, and you just solved it for me in like 2 minutes! =)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again!<br />

      <p class="post-content">ARGH! I didn't realize that StrFunc was so messy! :eek:<br />
      <br />
      While Afrow's solution works ok, I could see that getting very tedious if you had to use more than just that one function from StrFunc.nsh.<br />
      <br />
      Personally, I prefer using FileFunc.nsh or WordFunc.nsh instead. You get pretty much the same functionality as you would using StrFunc, but it's much easier to work with--especially when using multiple includes as in your example.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The simple way to find the value of ${UnStrTrimNewLines} (and any others) for comparison is to do !error `${UnStrTrimNewLines}` at the top and then copy its value from the makensis log.<br />

      <pre>
!ifndef StrTok_INCLUDED
<br /> ${StrTok}
<br />!endif 
</pre>But it is still a bad solution for header files, because if the header file with ${StrTok} definition is included before ${StrTok} is used in main file - it will cause errors.<br />
      <br />
      I bet many people will struggle with the same problem with officially distributed StrFunc.nsh<br />
      <br />
      How about to add this info in header or deprecate ${StrTok} calls in favor of usual !insertmacro ?
