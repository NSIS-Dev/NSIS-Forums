My compromise was starting with the one-line "Don't panic!" to draw attention to the start of the message and read down, then balanced by the ending line of text. This way the URL isn't at the very end and the user is less likely to see one URL and skip to it. Ultimately I want to keep the logic of 'go to the start' rather than going against logic with a separate new URL.<br><br>--------<br><br>As for the NSIS Error page itself, I have a few suggestions to make this better. First, as Joost Verburg suggested, we should start with a direct statement that this is not the support page for any piece of software and to contact the original developers for support.<br><br><blockquote>Please notice that NSIS is not the developers of the software you are attempting to install. If you are having problems and need outside assistance, please check the support contacts from the creators of the software you are attempting to use. We'll help a bit with redownloading the file, but the people who make the software are better equipped to help you.<br><br>The problem you are having with this installer is due to an incomplete download or the file has been modified from it's original condition. This can happen to a number of reason, so we're going to go through a few steps to narrow down the problem and fix the issue.</blockquote>Then I'd move the log of error messages to the very end or remove them completely. We really don't need to show the same error message again to the user before trying to fix the problem.<br><br>Next, I'd combine the single and multiple installer steps into one larger but tiered tree. No normal user is going to know the difference between the NSIS installer verses an InstallSheild or other installer program. To most users, installers are all the same: They install software.<br><br>I can propose further edits to the NSIS Error page, but this post is long as it is.

It would, however, be possible to add a resource string containing the string. The MessageBox API supports specifying resource strings instead of actual strings which is pretty cool. The only problem with that is that the string is saved as Unicode in resource string tables. That doubles its size and annoys me.<br><br>As for the message itself, I agree with Anders that "Don't panic!" would do exactly the opposite. The other text makes me feel like a complete idiot. But that's just me and I'd probably never get to it. I think I've already said I'm far from the best guy for the task, not having English as my main language and being way too techy.
