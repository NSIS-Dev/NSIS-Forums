      Our software should install an application that runs every time the system boots. This application performs various system-configuration tasks that require elevated privileges. So when the application starts, a UAC window will pop up. But the systems our software runs on are not operated by users. So there is noone to confirm the dialog.<br />
      <br />
      Starting the application itself is no problem. I simply placed an entry at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. But how do I automatically start it elevated?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, I tried that but am a little confused about the results.<br />
      The application does not seem to run when the system is rebooted and when I start it manually, I still get prompted by UAC.</p>

      </blockquote>Yeah, that's what I did now. But networking works just fine with the LocalSystem account.

      </blockquote>Fine, but partly :) For example, network shares access will be a problem. But it is possible to run service from real account.
