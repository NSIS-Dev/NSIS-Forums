All I need to do is have a series of sections that a user can pick and show/hide different pages based on their choices. I have the sections working just fine, but I can't seem to find a good way to show or hide the pages. I figured that setting a variable in the section and then checking it at the begining of the custom page and calling abort or not would be a good solution. But I can't seem to get the dang thing to work. Rather then attach my rather lengthy installer, could someone just post a simple example?<br><br>I have read the docs extensivly and I am just missing it. I have also searched this board and archives and I am not seeing what I need. I have tried using the var command and it just errors. I think that is related to the version of NSIS I have, but I don't want to change it now. I've tried pushing a variable onto the stack and then popping it off and doing StrCmp (of which I can't find ANY significant mention here: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/</a> ??) but it is not working the way I would expect. Basically I do this:<br><br>Section "Test" TestSection<br>push "Test_True"<br>SectionEnd<br><br>Function PageToDisplayIfTestSectionIsInstalled<br>pop $0<br>StrCmp "$0" "Test_True" 0 runPage<br>Abort<br>runPage:<br>; do stuff here<br>FunctionEnd<br><br>And abort is called only if I DO install TestSection?! Anyways, any help would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>Mike</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pengyou</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2003 20:39 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Have you tried using a COMPONENTS page in your installer?

That's the trick, how does a custom page check "which sections have been selected".
