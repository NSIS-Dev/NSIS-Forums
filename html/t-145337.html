      <p class="post-content">This isn't related to your current problem, but you have a few errors in the script.<br>
      <br>
      "IntCmp $2 +1 +1 +1 +3" is wrong<br>
      <br>
      You are comparing the number (integer) stored in $2 to +1, which is wrong to start with because "+1" isn't an integer (it's a string).<br>
      If the value of $2 will be "+1" or similar, use StrCmp.<br>
      <br>
      Also, you've got some $\r$\r, and some $\n in message boxes.<br>
      The correct way is $\r$\n for newline breaks.<br>

      <p class="post-content">There is a problem with your backup macro. It assumes that $INSTDIR is $PROGRAMFILES\LucasArts\XwingAlliance. You better use $INSTDIR instead because it could be changed by InstallDirRegKey and any other piece of code you might add in the future that tempers with $INSTDIR.</p>

      I'm not sure where I got the Backup Macro, I thought you helped me with that? :) not sure, it might have been from the archive, or I found it in a script somewhere.<br>

      If you want to use it go ahead, it works fine :)<br>

      Oh and I replaced the IntCmp with StrCmp, didn't channge the numbers, but it wouldn't complie<br>

      $MUI_HWND contains the HWND of the inner IO dialog, so you need something like this:<br>

      <p class="post-content">As for the "+1" thing, NSIS will treat +1 as 0. NSIS's atoi (string to number) function only treats the minus signal, not the plus sign. Therefore when it won't see any digits but only the plus sign it will convert no longer and will remain with the result 0. If you wish to compare to 1 you should do it like this:<br>
      <br>
      IntCmp $2 1 +1 +1 +3<br>

      The relative jump numbers do accept the plus sign but it's not mandatory.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah Joost, thats excatly what I did :)<br>
      <br>
      Ans sorry Kichik to waste your time but, I was going to remove the Check reg for JoystikID thing and replace it with something like:-<br>
      <br>
      If file exist = Xwingalliance.exe carry on with the install to check if its the correct version (which I have already done), but if it doesn't detect the existance of XWA.exe it quits<br>
      <br>
      The thing is I can only get as far as If file exists and abort, I'm not sure what the code should be any help would be great or a pointer to an example or prvious forum topic<br>
      <br>
      I have tried searching for something like this but with no result<br>

If it doesn't exist call Abort and the installation won't even start. It's recommended that you show a message box stating why the installer didn't start so the user won't get confused.<br>

      What I would like it to do is, if it is found in the $INSTDIR to continue with the setup, but if it's not found then it shows the message and aborts.<br>
      <br>
      I know it will probably have something to do with Goto, but thats where I'm stuck!<br>
      <br>
      The next thing it would do is to check the version ot see if it is the correct version, using this bit of code in the Function .onInit section which works fine.<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>sysinfo::GetFileVersion "$PROGRAMFILES\LucasArts\XwingAlliance\XwingAlliance.exe"<br>Pop $0<br>Push $0<br>Push "."<br>Push ""<br>Call StrReplace<br>Pop $0<br>IntCmp $0 2002 +3 0 +3<br>MessageBox MB_ICONSTOP|MB_OK "WARNING: Incorrect Version blah blah blah."<br>Abort</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Function StrReplace<br>
      replace code and stuff blah blah<br>
      FunctionEnd<br>
      <br>
      Oh yeah I did look at that code you suggested, but I don't think it would be any good as like you said it searches the whole HD.

      <p class="post-content">Nothing with Goto, it's actually very simple. Just remove that 0 that comes before +3. What you've told IfFileExists to do is to jump +3 if it didn't find that file. The first number tells it where to jump if it did find, the second if it didn't. You've mixed them up, that's all.<br>
      <br>
      The second piece of code that checks the version can come right after the first piece. It should work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There is no direct way. You can pad the text with spaces from both sizes, but you can never be sure it will work on all configurations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You have a multi-line message box and want the text to be centered? I don't think that's a good idea (it doesn't look nice and isn't the Windows style).</p>

      <p class="post-content">No I'm using the<br>
      <br>
      !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_LINK<br>
      !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_LINK_LOCATION<br>
      <br>
      in my script, and since the colour is defined in the System.nsh file for the link how would I change it for my script to refer to changing the colour, do I have to create a new ini file, if so, how do I tell it to to change the link colour on the Finish page<br>
      <br>
      plus I'm already using the !define MUI_SPECIALINI for ini file for the link on the Welcome page</p>

      <p class="post-content">You should simply write the desired TxtColor value into ioSpecial.ini in the pre function of the finish page. Look for MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_FINISH_PRE in the MUI readme for more information about the pre function of the finish page.</p>

      Edit: done :) Get the latest development version and use MUI_FINISHPAGE_LINK_COLOR. See Readme for details.</p>
