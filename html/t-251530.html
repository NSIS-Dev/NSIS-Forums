Macros can be used inside of function just fine.<br><br>The actual error is a result of trying to use a run-time command outside of a function.<br><br>For example, ReadIniStr is a runtime function. You could include this command in a macro and that would still be legal.<br><br>If you then used !insertmacro to insert that macro outside of any function or section, you would recieve the error. But, if you used the same !insertmacro call from within a function or section, then the compiler would be perfectly happy.<br><br>The general rule is that anything in the help files under "instructions" (section 4.9) should be considered a runtime instruction.<br><br>If all this seems confusing, my recommendation would be to study the examples and start experimenting with some simple scripts of your own. Eventually, it'll all make sense.
