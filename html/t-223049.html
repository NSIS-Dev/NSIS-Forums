When I insert a CD, a installation directory selection windows is shown with Cancel and Browse buttons. When I click any one button, the light of the CDRom is on and the selection window is no response. After a few minutes (around &gt; 5 minutes), the installer resume active. I wonder what it is doing during a long period of time. Is it related to the large number of files in the installer? Any work around solution to resolve that situation? :confused:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Comperio</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd August 2005 04:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I have to say, I'm a bit puzzled. As far as I know, NSIS is should not doing anything at the directory sceen (at least not until the user clicks install or browse.)<br><br>Can you provide any other details about the OS on the test computer, such as version or service packs? And what about the installer? what compression do you use? (If you use files in the install for custom pages or other functions, you may need to use ReserveFile functions.) Have you tried running the install from the hard drive just to see if any delays are present there?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd August 2005 13:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Have you tried the CD on another machine?<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">unplug</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd August 2005 07:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">In the CD, it has an installer (program.exe) and autorun.inf to auto run the installer.<br>In the installer (program.exe), it contains over 3 thousand files.
