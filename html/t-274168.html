      <p class="post-content">Hi Afrow UK,<br />
      <br />
      Even simple script<br />
      <br />
      LockedList::AddFile /NOUNLOAD $SYSDIR\kernel32.dll"<br />
      LockedList::Dialog<br />
      <br />
      doesn't work for me.<br />
      <br />
      I get messages "Going to compile test program and then run it"<br />
      then "The file '$TEMP\nsz1325.tmp\Lock' is now locked. It will appear on the LockedList dialog page soon..." some dialog blinks and that's all.<br />
      <br />
      The same result I've got with example provided with plugin.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Firstly, you're missing a quote and secondly that's a module not a file.<br />
      <br />
      How about this script:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>Name "LockedList Test"<br />OutFile "LockedListTest.exe"<br /><br />!include MUI.nsh<br /><br />!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_WELCOME<br />Page Custom LockedListShow<br /><br />!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE English<br /><br />Function LockedListShow<br />  LockedList::AddModule /NOUNLOAD "$SYSDIR\kernel32.dll"<br />  LockedList::Dialog<br />FunctionEnd<br /><br />Section<br />SectionEnd</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      You'll get some garbage for the first program captions. I might be able to fix this.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thank you for sample but it also doen't work for me.<br />
      It seems that the problem is exactly in LockedList::Dialog<br />
      <br />
      I modified your sample adding three message boxes<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Name "LockedList Test"<br />OutFile "LockedListTest.exe"<br /><br />!include MUI.nsh<br /><br />!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_WELCOME<br />Page Custom LockedListShow<br /><br />!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE English<br /><br />Function LockedListShow<br />  MessageBox MB_OK "test1"<br />  LockedList::AddModule /NOUNLOAD "$SYSDIR\kernel32.dll"<br />  MessageBox MB_OK "test2"<br />  LockedList::Dialog<br />FunctionEnd<br /><br />Section<br /> MessageBox MB_OK "test3"<br />SectionEnd<br /></code>

      <p class="post-content">Found the problem. It was a bad array pointer. It wasn't the fact of the file not being there it was simply only taking the first file or module added with AddFile/AddModule.<br />
      <br />
      I was also able to fix the captions problem. I noticed captions were being repeated over multiple processes aside from the garbage caption for the first few processes. Just needed a ZeroMemory in there.<br />

      <p class="post-content">One more suggestion. I'm not compeltely happy with results.<br />
      For example, I have two browser application run: Internet Explorer and Moxilla Firefox both on page <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/File:LockedList.zip" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/File:LockedList.zip</a><br />
      <br />
      also I use following code in a script<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />LockedList::AddModule /NOUNLOAD "$SYSDIR\kernel32.dll"<br />LockedList::Dialog<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      and as results I've got<br />
      WINAMP.COM | Forums - LockedList plug-in - Moxilla Firefox (firefox.exe)<br />
      for Moxilla Firefox<br />
      and<br />

      <p class="post-content">Another suggestion.<br />
      <br />
      Add horizontal scroll when long name is displayed.<br />

      <p class="post-content">This isn't possible because the list box is actually a list view with a single hidden column set to the width of the box. The NSIS InstFiles page has the same thing. Another option would be to have a tool-tip like the InstFiles page...<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can use ListView_SetColumnWidth with LVSCW_AUTOSIZE, but I think the triple dot looks better. If someone wants to see the entire line, he could just hover over it instead of scrolling and then seeing just the end.</p>

      <p class="post-content">During testing of various locked items, I found a minor quirk. The locking process was detected going away for the exe's, but when I exited explore (brought up inside the target install directory), that was not detected going away. I had to navigate back and then next again to repeat the locked file search to get past it to the install. Also during testing, I ran into an "out of memory" message that appeared in the dialog just before the process name. That only happened once and did not repeat itself during futher testing.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Paths</strong><br />
      It appears that the plugin doesn't try both short and long paths so both need to be added for files / modules that may be in use with either a long or short path. Might be a nice addition for the plugin to check both behind the scenes.<br />
      <br />
      Better still would be the ability to match files / modules in use by file name and then compare the paths to verify they are the same. This would also cover the unlikely scenario where the path is a combination of both long and short. Also, files / modules names can be short.<br />
      <br />
      Besides that all I can say is wow... this is an extremely useful plugin.<br />
      <br />

        v0.4 - 27th September 2007<br />
        * Module or file names can now be just the file name as opposed to the full path.<br />
        * Folder paths are converted to full paths (some are short DOS paths) before comparison.<br />
        * Fixed typo in AddModule function (ModulesCount&gt;FilesCount). Thanks kalverson.<br />
        * List view is now scrolled into view while items are added.<br />
        * List changed to multiple columns.<br />
        * Debug privileges were not being set under SilentSearch.<br />
        * Added /ignore switch that prevents the Next button being disabled.<br />
        * Added AddApplications to add all running applications to the list.<br />
        * Added processing mouse cursor.<br />
        * Added right-click context menu with Close and Copy List options.<br />
        * Added progress bar.<br />
        * Added default program icon for processes without an icon.<br />
        * Added code to resize controls for different dialog sizes.
      </blockquote>I cannot reproduce that crash kalverson and by the looks of it it's out of my control, unless the module handle being passed is not valid. I could surround it by a try{} block but I am not keen on that idea.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I have a question about the LockedList plugin. Does AddFile support searching an entire directory? I couldn't find where it specifically said it was supported in the readme. I wanted to know that this is an option, before I go and try to fix my installer problems using this plugin.<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully it does, because this plugin looks awesome and is basically the perfect solution for what I'm trying to do.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Sorry, wild cards are only supported for window classes/captions. If your executable name is unique enough, just use AddModule \File.exe or AddFile \File.txt<br />

        <p class="post-content">I'm running into two problems with LockedList...<br />
        <br />
        1. It can't seem to detect that the files I specified are in use.<br />
        I'm using:<br /></p>
        <pre>
<code><br />LockedList::AddModule /NOUNLOAD "$SYSDIR\OurDLL.dll"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
        ( I take it /NOUNLOAD is still required even in the new NSIS handling? )<br />
        But as far as the search is concerned, the file is not locked. Unlocker ( <a href="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/" target="_blank">http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/</a> ) says otherwise.<br />
        Any tools out there that might help in identifying why LockedList doesn't see it while Unlocker does?<br />
        ( I'd try whouses.exe as well, but I seem to be whouses.exe-less )<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        2. LockedList crashes after parsing two of such modules.<br />
        The search process reaches 93%, usually when it will display that it found no processes using the file(s), and simply crashes.<br />
        <br />

        <p class="post-content"><strong>LockedList crashes when no files or modules are added</strong><br />
        I just found that when running a setup that contains no LockedList::AddModule or LockedList::AddFile calls, and calls LockedList:: Dialog, it crashes with "An unhandles win32 exception" (the regular Windows segfault message).<br />
        <br />
        My guess is that LockedList:: Dialog fails to check whether some variables normally set by AddFile or AddModule are set.<br />
        <br />
        In most cases this is not a problem of course, as usually there will be files to check for, but in this case the NSI script is generated, and will contain LockedList:: Dialog regardless of whether any files were actually found during generation that causes AddFile or AddModule calls to be made.<br />
        <br />
        I can (and probably will) change the generator to also add the LockedList:: Dialog only when needed, but it would probably be a good idea to also make LockedList:: Dialog perform the necessary checks to prevent it from crashing regardless.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Heya Afrow,<br />
        <br />
        Good to see this plugin still being worked on after all :)<br />
        <br />
        I have no idea if the updates happen to resolve the issue I had earlier - will see eventually in current development, though.<br />
        <br />
        Before upgrading I did run into the crash situation (at 87%, every time) again; it's entirely weird.. changing the compression type, removing a messagebox that displays 2 variables (or changing it so it only displays 1), etc. would make the crash go away; no such crash in the current version as far as I can tell.. but if that sounds indicative of something scary that you'd want to check out anyway, just say the word. The DLL doesn't have version information, buts its date is 2008-02-26.<br />
        <br />
        =====<br />
        <br />
        However, I -am- seeing some garbled output in the dialog list with the new version (edit: non-unicode);<br /></p>
        <pre>
<code><br />!addplugindir ".\Plugins\"<br />OutFile "test.exe"<br /><br />Page Custom customPage<br /><br />Function customPage<br />        LockedList::AddModule /NOUNLOAD "$WINDIR\notepad.exe"<br /><br />        LockedList::Dialog<br />FunctionEnd<br /><br />Section<br />SectionEnd<br /></code>

        That garbled line goes away once it's done checking.

        ..there was a request to add an option to only show the dialog if there were locked files found. Any thoughts on this?<br />
        I don't have a need for it myself as I'm performing a few other tests anyway (check if the target file exists, check if the file I want to install is newer, check if the file can be opened for write mode*) and abort the page display if the file being in a locked state isn't an issue.<br />
        <br />
        * I read the thread with the caveat about 'shared write', but apparently some 'locked' files can happily be renamed just as well. Shared write is highly unlikely for the files I'm dealing with (DLLs), so that's okay.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Yes, showing the daialog only if files are locked is a good suggestion. We don't want this dialog to interfere unless it is necessary. BTW, also possibly giving the search path is also a good option . This will avoid by listing all files individually.<br />

        <p class="post-content">Sweet - thanks for the update!<br />
        <br />
        Out of curiosity.. what happens with AddModule when supplying 64bit DLLs?<br />
        Or, in the case of AddFile, what happens with regard to the filesystem redirection on $SYSDIR / the use of SysNative?<br />
        <br />
        I've adjusted my installers to use $WINDIR\SysNative if ${AtLeastWinVista} and disable/revert FS redirection on XP64 (can't rely on the hotfix/existence of the folder), but it dawned upon me that I haven't the foggiest how LockedList responds to these things :)<br />
        <br />
        I'll try a few tests myself later - just musing in here.</p>

        <blockquote>
          As NSIS is 32-bit, the plug-in cannot enumerate modules of 64-bit processes (the AddModule plug-in function). This can only be fixed if a 64-bit version of NSIS is developed.
        </blockquote>Disabling redirection will have no effect. It is doing string comparisons only so whatever path you give it is what it will match on. To avoid this issue, you can simply use \subpath\modulename.dll instead of a full path.<br />

        <p class="post-content">gah - totally missed that rather prominently displayed bit in the readme. Any work-around ideas? I can still detect that I can't open it for writing / can't overwrite it, so i can still detect that -something- has it locked.*<br />
        <br />
        Not using the full path should probably work in this instance, even though it reduces it to just the filename. I suppose that might give issues if, say, one wants to check what application is locking "c:\somedir\somefile.ext" by using "somefile.ext" and another application has "c:\anotherdir\somefile.ext" open.<br />
        Edit: Not that there's any point in doing this in my case - given that they're 64bit DLLs.<br />
        <br />
        * Edit: I suppose I could use LockedList's stack output function for the 32bit parts, my own functions (that don't identify the locking process, of course) for the 64bit parts and populate some manner of list display myself - possibly using an NSDialogs timer to refresh the list periodically (not spotting a hook into the automatic update part of the LockedList dialog - and I'd need the timer for my own function anyway). Hmmm.</p>

        <br />
        Short of creating a completely custom page - is there any way to add to the LockedList list manually? I suppose through poking at SysListView32 directly, if nothing else.

        <p class="post-content">oh, on a rather unrelated note, I'm still getting the odd bits in the top of the list - but the new version at least seems to spit out some useful information; it reports the process ID as 4 (which, according to taskman, is the System process).<br />

        I have no idea why it's listing that - notepad certainly isn't running (if it is, it adds a 2nd line listing notepad itself). Windows XP, 32bit, SP2 and any other information you'd need, just say the word :)</p>

        <p class="post-content">Ah, I'll have to re-test.<br />
        <br />
        =====<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, AddClass, AddCaption, looping over processes etc. wouldn't do much good as I don't have the particulars of the application(s) that might use these libraries. They're basically DLLs that other developers can, and are likely to, make use of.. but I don't think we can dictate "Thou Shalt Useth This Class" :)<br />
        <br />
        Adding (err.. and removing, I suppose) custom data basically just to populate the list and have LockedList realize whether the list is empty or not.<br />
        <br />
        E.g. Let's say I run my own function to at least check if -something- is locking a 64bit file.. I can't tell what is locking it, but at least I can tell the user that something is. Quite possibly, they'll know what's locking it and can then close it.<br />
        <br />
        So having identified that a particular file is locked, say I call:<br />
        LockedList::AddCustomItem "path\filename" ["unknown process"]<br />
        That adds the custom item to the locked list internal list and display list. The display list so that, obviously, it is displayed..and the internal list so that if the other locks that LockedList handled itself are closed, it doesn't immediately report that there's nothing left to close.<br />
        <br />
        This would require a companion function a la...<br />
        LockedList::RemoveCustomItem "path\filename" that would remove the matching item. I'm *presuming* that it wouldn't require some manner of unique ID to be returned from AddCustomItem that would then get fed to RemoveCustomItem, instead just string matching.. but whatever is easier/better/etc.<br />
        This function would get called if my own function determines that said lock is, in fact, gone.<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately this probably means quite a few other changes - can't just add an nsDialogs timer to your dialog to periodically call my function / add a button to manually refresh / etc. so the plugin would have to call it and so forth and so on.<br />
        <br />
        Hence why I was already thinking that -maybe- it's better I create my own custom page with a list (probably through EmbeddedList), and populate that out of the LockedList stack methods. I'd lose the automatic checking - instead having to re-requery LockedList.. or.. actually I guess I can just check if the process that LockedList reported is still present when I do my refresh.. that should have the same effect?<br />
        <br />
        I'd better check that System process bit first :)</p>

          <p class="post-content">Uploaded v1.1. The callback is called initially before adding the custom item and then again every second after searching has completed.<br />
          <br />
          Edit: And FYI <a href="http://winprogger.com/?p=26" target="_blank">Why do win32 calls GetModuleFileNameEx, EnumProcessModules, EnumProcessModulesEx fail in Wow64?</a><br />
          Edit 2: LockedList uses GetProcessImageFileName if it exists so LockedList will work for all executables (32-bit or 64-bit) but cannot work for 64-bit modules. One idea (which Process Explorer uses) is to run a secondary 64-bit process which relays information back to the 32-bit process (in this case, the plug-in) but this would be a lot of work.<br />

          <p class="post-content">Excellent - That is actually a pretty elegant solution to an entirely non-elegant problem.. makes LockedList extremely flexible as a sweet side-effect :)<br />
          <br />
          One question if I may; the Custom example (which is still titled 'Using AddModule and notepad.exe' - btw) seems to use $R0 - the callback function address - 3 times. The docs only specify it once. I commented out the 2nd and 3rd and the example still runs so I suppose they're at least not required - but now I'm curious as to why they're there :D<br />

          <p class="post-content">Sweet - as far as I can tell, this will work beautifully.. still have to test it in the wild, but several quick simple tests haven't revealed any particular problems.<br />
          <br />
          So now I have...<br />
          <br />
          ${LockCheck} : a simple locked files checker macro bit that only reports -if- a file is locked (if it exists, and if we care (version number check)), not -what- is locking it..<br />
          <br />
          1. that I feed target/source files into with a single line call for each module<br />
          2. if it is determined none of the files are locked (based on the output of the macro), skip the LockedList dialog, otherwise...<br />
          3. initialize the LockedList dialog with those Module (32bit) or Custom (64bit) items that were determined to be locked, which will report the locking applications (32bit) and my Custom items (64bit)<br />
          4. which will automagically check everything except for the Custom items for which it calls...<br />
          5. a callback which invokes the simple locked files checking macro ${LockCheck} and...<br />
          6. tells lockedlist whether or not the file is unlocked based on its output again.<br />
          <br />
          It's not perfect, but it's much better than going *BOINK* at a user mid-file installation with a can't-overwrite-this-file dialog :)</p>

          <p class="post-content">I just realized that when the dialog closes, the stack value for the next button is always "next" - which means you can't discern from it whether the user clicked the next (all apps were closed / there was nothing to close to begin with) or the 'ignore' button.<br />
          <br />
          These are one and the same button just with custom captions on them, of course - which also leads to the work-around: grab the text off of the button and compare it to the '/ignore text' flag value you defined. Just thought it might be good if the plugin handled this in the value it pushes to the stack :)</p>

          I use Stu's plugin in my installer and it crash when it is trying to kill that application with our title (but only unicode build, ansi build works ok...)<br />

          </blockquote>How do you typically debug this? I've built it in Visual Studio 2008, and I'm trying to attach to my installer exe instance with no luck, so I'm probably missing something obvious. I'd be glad to help if I can.

          <p class="post-content">You can use the SilentSearch function for that but be warned the process can take a little time for modules (even on super fast machines) and even longer for file handles. Hence why the search occurs while the screen is visible.<br />
          <br />
          If you just want to make the label transparent the control ID is defined in resource.h.<br />
          You need to use InitDialog and Show plugin calls and InitDialog pushes the window handle onto the stack (just like InstallOptions).<br />

          The problem is in the source code; it references PARAM_SEARCHING in the part of the code dealing with the /noprograms flag. Must be a copy/paste-effected regression :)

            Let's say you need to overwrite a few files in 'c:\windows\'... would you honestly want to feed LockedList 'c:\windows\*.*' and have it throw up pretty much every locked file.. even though you might only want to overwrite two of them?<br />
            <br />
            I think your best bet is to create a list of the files you want to overwrite - either by A. hardcoding this in the installer by hand or by a pre-installer build-installer or B. extracting your files to a temporary location and use any of the FindFirst / FindNext / bits and pieces - and feed that to LockedList<br />
            <br />
            The 'B' method could be combined with lockedlist directly.<br />
            i.e.<br />
            <pre>
<code><br />for each destination path (<br />  extract the files that go to a certain path to a temporary location<br />  loop over the extacted files, and for each file (<br />    add the 'destination path\filename' to LockedList<br />  )<br />)<br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            The temporary location can be re-used with e.g. CopyFiles to get the files to the destination path without having to re-extract them from the installer.

            <p class="post-content">You're better of generating the LockedList AddFile/AddModule code at compile time using Locate in a specially built NSIS executable that you execute with !system (see <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Invoking_NSIS_run-time_commands_on_compile-time" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Invoking...n_compile-time</a>). However, I think AddFolder would be fine when used properly (i.e. your application's path that you may wish to completely remove).<br />

            I understand the complexity involved if AddFolder ( proposed function by Stu) is not used properly. As rightly said , using it on C:\Windows or any system related folders can be an issue. If we know what folders or files that are going to be targeted , this is not an cause of worry .<br />
            <br />
            @Stu<br />
            <br />
            This function if developed can ease my application's perfomance, because the application can cause any of the files in the instalation directory to be locked. Hence looping over and using AddFile is an existing option, but an overhead.</p>

            <p class="post-content"><strong>IsFileLocked issue</strong><br />
            Hi Stu<br />
            <br />
            Thanks for the plugin, it is very good and helpful.<br />
            <br />
            Anyway, while testing it in my installer I've found one bug. It treat file as blocked in the case when this file has non-existent directories within the full path. This can be easily fixed by replacing this piece of code at line 2050 in LockedList.cpp<br />
            <br /></p>
            <pre>
<code><br />      if (GetLastError() != ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)<br />        fLocked = TRUE;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            with<br />
            <br />
            <pre>
<code><br />      if ((err != ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) &amp;&amp; (err != ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND))<br />        fLocked = TRUE;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            Also it would be great to replace<br />
            <br />
            <pre>
<code><br />#include "afxres.h"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            to<br />
            <br />
            <pre>
<code><br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            in LockedList.rc to be able to compile with MSVC Express edition.<br />

            <p class="post-content">LockedList plugin doesn't seem to work with x64?<br />
            I added this line in the installer script:<br />
            <br />
            LockedList::AddModule "$INSTDIR\some.dll"<br />
            <br />
            When compiled with w32, the dll is detected and the running program is shown. But when compiled on x64 and running it on the x64-Version of the program that is locking the dll, the file is not shown in the locked list.<br />
            <br />
            Is this a known issue?</p>

            </blockquote>Yes. Because NSIS itself is not 64bit, and thus the LockedList plugin isn't 64bit, it also can't really access 64bit process information that would be required for this.<br />
            <br />
            One thing you can try is testing if the file is locked, rather than the module. For this you might have to use a manual testing method, like trying to open the file for appending. If that fails - the file is locked. There's a few downsides to that method (you touch the file, and you won't know -what- is locking the file), but it's possibly all you've got :)

            <p class="post-content"><strong>Add Custom not working?</strong><br />
            Hi, I am making an enhancement to our installer to change the horrible "MCI-Command Handling Window" holding open an activex control to be a more sensible message but I can't get the AddCustom work.<br />
            <br />
            I have tried using the example LockedListCustom.nsi and this builds but when I say 'Yes' to the question is myapp running it never show sin the lockedlist window. I get the same behaviour in my own installer.<br />
            <br />
            Details:<br />
            <br />

            <br />
            I have this running twice in the code above, once detecting if the file is in use (and currently forcing a true return) and once is extracted straight from the demo app.<br />
            <br />
            Any help with how to get this working appreciated.<br />
            <br />
            Thanks<br />

            <br />
            what version of the plugin are you using? I'll downgrade on my test setup and check that this code does actually work in principle.<br />

            <p class="post-content">My version is not versioned, so I can't say... but the date on the file inside the archive is 2010/Apr/28 - which would make it version 1.5 . Actually, I should have 1.6 in the actual current build as that fixes the Next button text. There's quite a few changes since 1.5/1.6, so I'd wait and see if Afrow knows what the problem might be (I didn't spot anything standing out in the source code, but I'm not a C/C++ programmer) so it can be fixed :)</p>

            <p class="post-content">Yes, it looks like this bug was introduced in V1.7, this works in V1.6 but when I upgrade to V1.7 then myapp never gets shown using the custom example.<br />
            <br />
            A lot changed between the versions so I can't even see anything obvious to try and help sorry :(<br />
            <br />
            I could only see that it changed from using uiFunctionAddress to iFunctionAddress<br />

              <p class="post-content">Agreed that closing programs without user interaction isn't a generally good idea. Our reasons are:<br />
              a) the updater needs to be totally passive with no user interaction required<br />
              b) our user base has proven itself incapable of closing programs on their own<br />
              c) other nsis plugins that I tried didn't provide nice feedback so we heard some complains about the updater being unresponsive if it took a long time to close a program.<br />

              LockedList is <i>process</i>-based, i.e. it checks for "local" processes that hold a lock on critical files and thus prevent the installer form continuing. While it might be possible to detect whether a local file is locked by "remote" access (actually the file would then be locked by the "file sharing" service running on the local machine), it won't be possible to tell which process on the "remote" computer holds the lock. There normally is, for good reason, no way to enumerate/analyze the processes on a "remote" machine. You'd have to run some kind of "monitoring service" on the remote machine to make information about running processes available over the network. Needles to say that the communication with the monitoring service should be encrypted and password protected. WMI can probably do that though...<br />
              <br />
              Without additional "monitoring" software running on the "remote" machine, the machine_id + user_id holding the lock on the file is probably all you can get. That's basically what "Shared Folders" -&gt; "Session" shows in the "Computer Manager".

              We're using LockedList to search for a running Process (see above part) in the .onInit function.<br />
              On 2.4 and 2.5 the installer simply exit (crashs?) between WelcomeScreen and License Page. On 2.3 it works. The problem occurs only on WinXP 64.<br />
              <br />
              We have just downgrade to 2.3 and hope we got no other problems.<br />
              Is there a way to fix it? Did you need some more information?<br />

              <br />
              The plug-in calls Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection but doesn't switch filesystem redirection on afterwards. I found this problem because I was trying to install some dlls to System32, and they ended up in the wrong place!<br />
              <br />
              I worked around the problem by adding the following to my nsi script after the lockedlist plugin had done its stuff:<br />
              <br />
              StrCpy $1 0<br />

              <br />
              the '/autonext' option is not working with the UNICODE plugin (on my Win7 x64 machine - if it is relevant).<br />
              <br />
              When I use 'LockedList::Show' and do a Pop $0 there are different strings in the ANSI and UNICODE plugin when I press the back button. $0 == 'back' (ANSI) and $0 == 'b' (UNICODE). This makes it hard to write compatible NSIS code (or I am using it the wrong way ;) ).</p>

                <p class="post-content">Hi, thanks for your quick reply.<br />
                <br />
                No, at the moment I am using the ANSI plugin with NSIS. But, because of some problems with my script I played a lot around with your plugin and also tested the UNICODE version.<br />
                Therefore I discovered these problems/bugs/inconsistencies.<br />
                <br />
                Maybe its no bug then sorry for wasting your time...<br />
                <br />
                Oh, but one other thing: Using the ANSI Plugin / 2.46 NSIS / Win7 X64. Installed on my test system was the AMD catalyst conrol center (sorry, at the moment I don't know which version - but I can receive it when you want to know).<br />
                The problem: while searching for processes it seems your plugin "touches" this running program (the control center) and causing it to crash.<br />
                Maybe the way you gain access to the running programs is the problem? The AMD tool was not in my lockedlist, btw. and it was the only program where I discovered such a behaviour but reproducable :)</p>

                <p class="post-content">You didn't answer my question. If you want to use the Unicode version of the plug-in you have to use the Unicode version of NSIS as well. Otherwise you experience the kind of 'bugs' you are getting.<br />
                <br />
                Edit: But if you are using the Unicode NSIS build then I will check it out.<br />

                  Is sometimes get the problem that the LockedList plug-in will get stuck in the "Cancelling search, please wait..." state.<br />

                  <br />
                  It will go on, as soon as I press some key or move the mouse cursor...<br />
                  <br />
                  My code looks like this:<br />

                I noticed that this doesn't only happen on my Win2k machine, it also happens under Wine (tested under version 1.4).<br />
                <br />
                Seems like it is "hanging" because it is waiting for some message, that, for whatever reason, doesn't arrive on Win2k or Wine.<br />
                <br />
                The WM_MOUSEMOVE message will eventually "unlock" it again, so that the installer can finally proceed...

                Can you see any reason why it thinks that so many processes need to be stopped? The installer would add .exe's, .dll's and various help files to the computer. Our software has not even been installed onto this computer yet, so I am not sure what to do. Should I call something other than AddFolder?

                <p class="post-content">What is the value of $INSTDIR? Yeah AddFile/AddFolder may not work properly on Windows 7. I need to retest those probably. I would recommend trying AddModule instead (32-bit binaries only).<br />

                Edit: Ignore what I just said. Just fixed it.<br />

                </blockquote>Edit 2: You may still want to look into AddModule though as it is a lot faster than AddFile/AddFolder. Unfortunately it will only work for 32-bit modules as NSIS is 32-bit.<br />

                $INSTDIR = "C:\Program Files (x86)\InspecVision\Planar"<br />
                At this time in the install, this would be the default location for where the product would be installed. The customer is trying to install it there for the first time, so given that the directory doesn't exist yet, then it should not be complaining about anything.<br />
                Just to confirm, this is an example of me calling AddFolder under Windows 7 and having problems with it. I will take a look into AddModule now and get back to you with any progress.<br />

                <p class="post-content">Hi Afrow,<br />
                I changed my installer to use AddModule and this seems to work much better on my customer's Windows 7 machine. I was able to do a remote connection with them when the installer was using AddFolder and due to their IT environment it was showing about 10 unrelated processes and services ( eg mcafee ) that needed to be closed before installation could continue. Using AddModule all is fine. Thanks for your help :)<br />

                <p class="post-content">I saw your original message but I hadn't seen the edit to it. This problem is only really repeatable on the customer's machine, so I now that I know that AddModule is working I have already sent him an installer using it. I don't have access to test out your new AddFolder code unfortunately unless the customer comes back with anything else. If they do, I will definitely let you know.</p>

                <br />
                I've also tried the sample lockedlistfindprocess.nsi with no luck either. It does not display any prompts if notepad is running.<br />
                <br />
                I've tried running on XP and 7, 32 and 64 bit, all with the same result.<br />
                <br />
                Any ideas what could be going wrong?<br />
                <br />
                Cheers,<br />

                <p class="post-content">You are not using the plug-in correctly. Look at the example scripts. There is an example script specifically for FindProcess (which is a utility function - LockedListFindProcess.nsi) and one for showing the LockedList dialog with notepad (LockedListNotepad.nsi).<br />

                <p class="post-content">Hi Stu, thanks very much for your help.<br />
                <br />
                It's a shame that I can't use FindProcess with the dialog. However, I've tried both the LockedListFindProcess.nsi and LockedListNotepad.nsi samples, both of which do not detect that notepad is running. I've tried changing the scripts to check for other executables that I have running with the same negative results.<br />
                It makes me wonder if there might be something up with my system that could cause this. Any ideas?<br />
                <br />

                <p class="post-content">You don't need to use FindProcess - the whole idea is you use the plug-in to detect a locked file, folder or module (dll/exe) and it will display the process(es) that is locking it. If you want to add a process yourself, you can use FindProcess in a custom callback - see the LockedListCustom.nsi example script.<br />
                <br />
                AddModule will not find 64-bit processes because NSIS is 32-bit. If you are running Windows x64 then you must run notepad.exe from SysWOW64 for the Notepad example to work. Yes this is a big drawback to the plug-in but unfortunately this is a limitation imposed by Windows. The readme clearly states this fact too - please read it.<br />
                <br />
                Edit: I do have plans to add an AddProcess method some day which will work on 32bit/64bit Windows (by using WMI).<br />

                <p class="post-content">Yes I have read the readme and was aware of the 64 bit limitation, which is something I need to work around for my application.<br />
                <br />
                I've tried the LockedListCustom.nsi example, and even that is not working. From looking at the script code I would expect to see a message box asking if My App v1.0 is running. However I don't see this, the page just says "No programs that have to be closed are running". So it looks like the callback is not being called?<br />
                <br />
                To give you some background, the problem that I am trying to solve is this. We write add-ins for AutoCAD. These add-ins are locked when AutoCAD is running so I need a way to prompt the user to close it. The complication is that AutoCAD comes in many flavours, languages, versions, plus 32 and 64 bit. The one constant is that its executable is always acad.exe. So I am thinking that my installer should be checking if acad.exe is a running process. However I can't seem to get the lockedlist plugin to do this.<br />
                <br />
                Edit: I've also tried the LockedListEnumProcesses.nsi example, and this too does not seem to work at all. I.e. no processes are listed in the details window.<br />
                <br />
                Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.<br />

                <p class="post-content">If nothing is working then the first thing I would check is if you've extracted the correct plug-in DLL. There's a Unicode version and an ANSI version - if you aren't using Unicode NSIS then you must use the ANSI version. I have just tested those two scripts and they are working fine for me (Windows 7 x64). In fact EnumProcesses is picking up 64-bit processes and their paths too - I'll look into that and see if I can get it to work for AddModule (when giving it an executable file).<br />
                <br />
                Edit: I just tried AddModule again and it does actually work for 64-bit processes after all (I was trying to find notepad.exe when I use notepad2.exe)! What it cannot do is find 64-bit DLL files (the 64-bit processes that are using them). I should update the readme. Either I fixed it myself some point or Microsoft have changed their API's to work for 32-bit processes via a Windows update.<br />

                <p class="post-content">Well it turns out that I was inadvertently trying to use the unicode build with an ansi installer. In my defence, it seems to have been caused by a bug in IZArc which I used to extract the dll from the zip file.<br />

                Firstly, thanks for the great plugin!<br />

                When using</p>
                <pre>
<code>LockedList::Dialog /autonext</code>
</pre>the back button doesn't work properly and instead takes you to the next page. Not really the desired behaviour since it prevents the user from going back past a certain point in the installer. This is using the latest ANSI plug-in (2.6.1.1).

                  Stu
                </blockquote>It seems the problem is more specific. Also, it is with autonext, not autoclose, that the problem exists. Using LockedListAutoNext.nsi as a base, I can reproduce the problem every time as long as notepad is not running. It seems that the problem occurs when no results are in the list while searching. The behavior is easier to see if AddFolder is used instead of AddModule. For instance, replace:<br />
                <pre>
<code>LockedList::AddModule $SYSDIR\notepad.exe</code>
</pre><br />
                in LockedListAutoNext.nsi with:<br />
                <pre>
<code>LockedList::AddFolder $SYSDIR\some_unused_or_non_existent_dir</code>
</pre><br />
                and you can see the back button behaves like the next button. But if you change the folder to one that must be in use so that you get results, such as:<br />
                <pre>
<code>LockedList::AddFolder $SYSDIR</code>
</pre><br />
                then the back button works correctly (even while search is ongoing).<br />
                <br />
                So again, the problem is only present when the result list is empty during search with /autonext

                </blockquote>But the problem is on the LockedList page itself. The first time the LockedList page shows up, if I click Back (during the scan) then it goes to the next page, but only if there are no results yet. If there are results and the scan is still in progress, the Back button works fine.<br />
                <br />
                In other words:<br />
                <br />
                1. Navigate to a LockedList page<br />
                2. During the scan, click Back<br />
                <br />
                If:<br />
                <br />
                a. there was a partial list of results at the time the Back button was clicked, then it will go back (as expected)<br />
                b. there were no results at the time the Back button was clicked, then it will go to the next page (NOT EXPECTED)<br />
                <br />
                'a' is the desired behavior regardless of whether search has found anything or not. I understand the behavior you mean if the user has already navigated past the LockedList page where we would skip back to the page before the LockedList page, but this behavior should not happen while the LockedList page is visible, and especially not on the first view of the page. I hope this clears up what I'm hoping to fix!

                  Is there a way to use autonext and autoclosesilent? In other words I would like it to skip the page if the file is not locked, but if it is locked then offer an option to close it.</p>

                    Hi.<br />
                    <br />
                    Is sometimes get the problem that the LockedList plug-in will get stuck in the "Cancelling search, please wait..." state.<br />
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    It will go on, as soon as I press some key or move the mouse cursor...<br />
                    <br />
                    My code looks like this:<br />

                    and it worked at killing the processes required to delete the file.<br />
                    but it required the additional handle.exe, which installs additional registry keys, etc.<br />
                    <br />
                    i noticed your plugin is much faster/easier to use.. ..<br />
                    however.. it kills the process to everyfile in the directory.<br />
                    <br />
                    whereas.. if i used the batch command w/ handle.exe,<br />
                    only the file's process is killed.<br />

                    <p class="post-content">Hey Afrow, I recently began to use your LockedList plugin and it works beautifully! It's perfect for exactly what we need, however the only issue I am running into is that the percentage sometimes gets out of whack. At times it works fine going from 0-100%, however other times it goes up to ~55000%. It's very odd behaviour, and was just wondering if there's anything we could be doing wrong?<br />
                    <br />
                    I'm running Windows 7 SP1, if you need anything just ask! Thanks</p>

                    <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
                    <br />
                    We are using LockedList in our setups and also been getting the huge %% issue. I investigated and fixed it. Going to clean the code up a bit and suggest my fix to the community very soon.</p>

                    <p class="post-content">Thanks! We were going to look into the issue at some point, but at the moment we are swamped with doing other things :) Glad someone looked into it!</p>
