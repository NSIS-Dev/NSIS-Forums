      <p class="post-content"><strong>Determine if Admin rights are needed (UAC)</strong><br />
      Hello all,<br />
      <br />
      I have an installer which can be used for "global", as well as "local" installations. By "global" I mean installing to system locations, creating shortcuts, etc...<br />
      While "local" installation is essentially just extracting into a directory (INSTDIR).<br />
      <br />
      The thing is, I don't know how to determine if it needs administrative privileges when doing a "local" installation. For example, doing an installation to "C:\program files\..." would require admin privileges, while installing to a user's personal directory wouldn't.<br />
      <br />
      Right now I just have "RequestExecutionLevel admin", but it doesn't allow ordinary users to do a "local" install to their directories.<br />
      <br />
      I know there's a UAC plugin ( <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in</a> ), but there's almost no documentation there and I have no idea how to use it to achieve my goal.<br />
      <br />
      Any help would be really appreciated.<br />
      Thanks in advance!</p>

      <br />
      The point of interest is the CreateFile/CloseHandle command. It does not actually create anything, but it will return a positive handle ID if the user calling it has enough privileges. If not, it'll return -1. Oh, and I pasted those two macros I used in here: <a href="http://nsis.pastebin.com/fc93d069" target="_blank">http://nsis.pastebin.com/fc93d069</a>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you both for your replies.<br />
      <br />
      The MultiUser stuff - I think I read somewhere that it's not compatible with UAC. Also, I don't quite see the thing I'm looking for there (maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way).<br />
      <br />
      MSG, thanks a lot for your code.<br />
      One question though - is this code known to work with WOW emulation on 64-bit windows? I know windows does a lot of behind-the-scenes path substitution in that mode, and e.g. "C:\windows\system32"'s parent directory may not always be "C:\windows". (I wrote that as an example - it might work for these directories, but for others it might not).</p>

(I wrote that as an example - it might work for these directories, but for others it might not).
      </blockquote>Hmm... That's an interesting question. I was going to say that, because the redirection happens behind the scenes, the above code should not be affected by it. "$INSTDIR\..\.." could never become some strange virtualstore directory, because $INSTDIR is just a string, and that string does not contain virtualstore.<br />
      But then I realized I have no idea when exactly the path gets expanded to its physical location. If "$PROGRAMFILES\Test\.." is expanded to $PROGRAMFILES before it's sent to win32 api, there's no problem. But if it's the api commands that expand the path... It might get tricky.<br />
      <br />
      Then again, although I don't know how to find out which of the two actually happens, I haven't encountered any problems with the code. But perhaps some programmer could help out to clarify?

      <p class="post-content">There seem to be a lot of cases when windows decides to rewrite the paths. I think this breaks the parent directory / subdirectory relationships based on path string parsing.<br />
      <br />
      There's this: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927387<br />
      <br />
      And there's also WOW64. For WOW64 I think the most correct way would be to get a real path from our virtualized path, and then use it in the above checks. Simply disabling the path translation is incorrect IMHO.<br />
      <br />
      I found the question asking about how to do this ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/942110/translating-32-bit-paths-to-their-wow64-equivalents ), but it remains unanswered.</p>
