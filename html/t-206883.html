      <br />
      <b>Known problems:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>The version of Russian.nsh which is supplied with 2.05 doesn't compile. Use the attached version instead.</li>

        <li>If a section group is the first section, other section groups will not behave properly. Add an empty hidden section at the very top of the script to work around this problem.</li>
      </ul>All of the these problems were already fixed in the latest CVS version. I predict some more glitches will be found because of all of the changes in the components code. Therefore, I will not release a fix-up version right now, but 2.06 next week.

      <p class="post-content">AdvSplash and LangDLL plug-ins problem in the NSIS 2.05 - installer goes to background after splash/lang window disappears. AdvSplash worked fine in 2.03 (and probably in 2.04, but I am not sure). LangDLL had the same problems in 2.04 (and may be earlier).<br />
      This happens on the one of my comps only - Win2K Server Rus SP2, PII-350 256 MB (and bad video card). On the other comp with Win2K Pro Eng SP4, PIII-533 128 MB plug-ins work fine. The same with MSI Banner plug-in. My NewAdvSplash still works correct on both comps. May be first comp works too slowly? But why AdvSplash plug-in worked correct on the same comp in 2.03 version? Any "fixed bugs"? ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">It works fine for me on both slow and fast computers. Since it only happens on one of your computers, maybe it's a problem with it? Have you tried running it in safe mode where some programs will not interfere? Have you tried finding the differences between "your NewAdvSplash" and the other plug-ins?</p>

      <p class="post-content">As you all have probably noticed already, I didn't release 2.06 last weekend. I didn't have too much time last weekend, and I won't have this time too. Other than the Russian language file bug, there aren't any major problems with 2.05 that affect everyone, so it's not that bad anyway. 2.06 should be released in two or three weeks, on schedule. Hopefully, it will include some more automated testing to prevent problems, such as the language file problem, in the future.</p>

      <p class="post-content">KichiK, I have not clear understanding of "background" problem in AdvSplash. This is why while adding my little changes to base version (C-file header includes change history from Justin to my add-ons) I had to repeat changes step-by-step moving from old to new version and finally it began and continue working (and this is my solution ;) ). AdvSplash.c 2.03 and 2.05 "diff -B --ignore-all-space" 7 kB shows that someone worked hard with file formatting (and made little changes in "state" var). But finally I do not see any reasons for AdvSplash to change behavior, something weird again..</p>

      <p class="post-content">(I'm using latest NSIS available via the menu-&gt;Update latest<br />
      development and this is the AbiWord installer.)<br />
      I'm not sure if this is a bug (either in NSIS or my script) or a change somewhere between 2.02 and 2.05, but my installer script builds fine but there are two major differences:<br />
      - the default install type is now custom instead of typical<br />
      Is there a new command that must be used (or maybe one I<br />
      should have been using) to indicate the default one?<br />
      - subsections don't work like they used to, in particular,<br />
      when only partial subitems are selected the check box in<br />
      the parent remains clear or selected (whichever it was)<br />
      instead of the former grey+check, even unselecting all<br />
      items does not clear the parent (group) checkbox (only<br />
      directly clicking on it). Is this the expected bevahiour,<br />
      part of the bugs you are talking about above, or something<br />
      that requires a change in my installer [if so I would<br />
      appreciate directions as what to look into]?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for helping me determine where the problem is.</p>

      <p class="post-content">According to the latest <a href="http://www.abisource.com/bonsai/cvsblame.cgi?file=abi/src/pkg/win/setup/NSISv2/AbiWord.nsi&amp;rev=&amp;root=/cvsroot" target="_blank">abi/src/pkg/win/setup/NSISv2/AbiWord.nsi</a>, you have a section group (subsection) as the very first section. This is the trigger for the second known problem described in the first post. Your description also matches the bug symptoms. Simply add an invisible section before the first section group to avoid this bug.<br />
      <br />
      Using the latest from CVS didn't help because you probably didn't recompile makensis.exe. I no longer upload a new version of makensis.exe to CVS for every change. I only upload a new version when I release a new version of NSIS. I intend to remove all executables from CVS once I finish a build system I'm currently working on. The new build system will build the entire NSIS package so it'll be easy to make a complete nightly package.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, I recompiled latest cvs version and using it the<br />
      selection of sections within groups now appears to be fine,<br />
      however, the default install type is still always Custom.<br />
      I added an initial hidden empty section and it made no<br />
      difference regarding the install type, I even added explicit<br />
      calls to SetCurInstType (1st tried in .onit function, and<br />
      then even tried in my 1st section). Should I file a bug for<br />

      <p class="post-content">I have tried to reproduce this with the latest CVS version, but couldn't get it to start with the custom install type selected. It always starts with typical. It might be because of the many changes I've made to the script.<br />

      I couldn't find anything in the script that would make SetCurInstType in .onInit, placed after !insertmacro SectionList "InitSection", not work. Any chance you can get a smaller script reproducing this problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I narrowed down my problem to the add/remove aspect of<br />
      my installer. When a previous install exists (ie it finds<br />
      the list of installed components) it should set the<br />
      corresponding sections to match, but apparently is failing<br />
      somewhere and pretty much just deselects everything;<br />
      but when I remove the entries so as to mimic a fresh<br />
      install it does correctly start with typical.<br />
      I will do some more testing and see if I can track down<br />
      what is causing the difference.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There was another change in 2.05 that might have caused this. Selecting a section group with SetSectionFlags now affects its children too, just like when the user clicks a section group. However, I didn't notice any section groups on the list in SectionList. Is there another place in the script that might set flags for section groups?</p>
