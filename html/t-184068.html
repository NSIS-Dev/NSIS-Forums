      <p class="post-content"><strong>Dialer bug with windows 98</strong><br />
      Or rather windows 98 bug ;)<br />
      <br />
      I'm writing a script which is making repeated calls to the dialer plugin, and so I decided to leave the dll loaded to be less of a resource hog.<br />
      <br />
      This works fine on 2000 and XP but on windows 98 the dll seems to get in a flap. Specifically if I use the autodialonline function and later use the autodialhangup, then subsequent calls to autodialonline manage to create a connection but they return 'offline' (getconnectedstate is similarly broken after this).<br />
      <br />
      Having googled and searched around I cant find anyone else having this problem though i guess you all let the dll unload!<br />
      Is there a simple work around / tweak to the dialer.dll that anyone already knows about or is unloading the only route for me?<br />
      <br />
      Cheers</p>

      So its above the spec required... wininet does support the calls, but something gets confused somewhere.

      <p class="post-content">Heres a typical sequence.<br />
      <br />
      Call autodialonline - connection made and returns online<br />
      call getconnectedstate - returns online<br />
      call autodialhangup - returns success (and is successful!)<br />
      call getconnectedstate - returns offline<br />
      <br />
      Call autodialonline - connection made BUT returns offline<br />
      call getconnectedstate - returns offline (incorrectly)<br />
      call autodialhangup - returns success (though connection still exists)<br />
      call getconnectedstate - returns offline (though connection still exists)<br />
      <br />
      Call autodialonline - connection is promted even though there is already an active one... hitting cancel OR connect results in 'offline' being returned.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      If i then unload the dll it all starts working again...<br />
      <br />
      very odd huh?</p>

      <p class="post-content">oh and btw that self same sequence will behave itself on windows 2000 or xp. I think the double-dial connection thing quoted on msdn is where the modem has to make a call, connect to a machine then make another dial out to complete the connection.<br />
      <br />
      Its not that this shouldn't work, it should but its not doing! - i can attatch the script to make this sort of sequence if anyone has windows 98 and is interested!</p>

      <p class="post-content">It can be the time after you disconnect and before you connect again. Sometimes the Modem response is slow. Try to put a <i>Sleep</i> command between those. But I think it's not a NSIS problem, as by the source code of the plugin says.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for thinking about it. I think you're right its certainly wininet.dll thats broken, but I guess unloading the dll seems to fix whatever problem there is and that'll have to do.<br />
      Interesting problem though if anyone wants to know more about how broken 98 was!<br />

      <p class="post-content">sorry, just to clarify the sleeping doesnt help, wininet just starts going crazy if the dialer.dll doesnt get unloaded</p>
