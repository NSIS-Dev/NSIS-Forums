        XP doesn't prompted for an admin password.<br>

        <blockquote>
          RequestExecutionLevel admin
        </blockquote>This then forces the user to log in as administrator first.
      </blockquote>This is not correct. Requestexecutionlevel does NOTHING on windows xp. It only does something on Vista and newer with UAC turned on. You need to use the userinfo plugin to verify access level (in .onInit for example), and throw an error when it's not admin (and then quit the installer).<br>
      <br>

      </blockquote>This isn't true. You just need to make sure that you also verify admin access in the uninstaller (use un.onInit function). The setshellvarcontext all needs to be done either way, because admin-only installers should always install for all users. That's how Windows is designed.<br>
      <br>
      Long story short: Don't use the multiuser macros. If you need admin, install for all users. If not, install for single user.

      </blockquote>Seems to be the same conclusion I came too which is something I suppose.<br>
      <br>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Hmmm doesn't seem to be my experience. If it's not that line something in the multi user macro does force the installer to quit if you are not admin, which is what I need.<br>
      And it started happening the same time I added that line.... but it's not important really how it happens, it happens.<br>
      <br>
      This is my uninstall function currently<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>Function un.onInit<br>   !insertmacro MULTIUSER_UNINIT<br>FunctionEnd<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      This appears to ignore
      <pre>
<code>RequestExecutionLevel admin</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      What do I need to add to that to force a request in XP, as far as I found so far nothing will do that.

      <p class="post-content">Now I've switched back to non multi-user install the "You are not a admin" dislog has gone and you are right Requestexecutionlevel does nothing any more, so that must be part of the multi-user macro.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Like I said, you can use the UserInfo plugin to check for admin acccess, and throw an error if you don't have it. The fancy 'Enter your administrator password here' requires a lot of fancy coding. I guess you could use ShellExecuteEx. But it's a lot of work for a small function - the user can just run as admin themselves.</p>
