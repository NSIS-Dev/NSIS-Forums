      <p class="post-content"><strong>Bugs in NSIS</strong><br />
      I found 2 bugs in NSIS in this week:<br />
      <br />
      Using:<br />
      Windows 95 (without much of the updates, no internet)<br />
      Using latest development snapshot<br />
      <br />
      1) DeleteINISec command: doesn't return a error when a section doesn't exist.<br />
      <br />
      I put a IfErrors 0 "Loop" command after it, and never executed the code after the IfErrors (see the 0?) (it is in a loop part (using IntOp $1 $1 + 1, adding everytime), only exits when detect a error, but this is the problem).<br />
      <br />
      2) Banner Plugin: doesn't work after calling Install Options.<br />
      <br />
      It stops the program and I only can quit it using Ctrl+Alt+Del. Used just one time (to call it).</p>

      <p class="post-content">On both Wine and Windows XP the error flag is not set if the section was not deleted. You will need to find anther method to figure if the section is there or not. A constant key that will show in all of them should do the trick.<br />
      <br />
      Documentation fixed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This script is a part of my program. This RCTribes.nsh have the RCDefault.nsh (the start part of script). Use external file language strings and external search for tribes.... I will try to get a simpler script (like my last post, I don't have much time, so all go in "s l o w m o t i o n").</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why are you using /NOUNLOAD for Banner::Destroy? It will not unload this way.<br />
      <br />
      You are using a special build of InstallOptions. Unless it happens with the official build too, you should ask whoever built your InstallOptions. In this case, dselkirk.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>I will have a look in this.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>I used too the original one, and gave the same thing. As I wrote above, I will try do the /UNLOAD thing first.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Maybe someone have to update the examples of plugins come with NSIS. They have the old "Icons" folder, that is now the "Graphics" folder. About ALL of the examples relationated with graphics have the problem (AdvSplash, BgImage...).

      <p class="post-content">Now I'm more able to describe this:<br />
      <br />
      First, this bug "aparently" occurs only in Win95 (my program was based in the Win98 SE, now I have a Win95, this occured in the first compilation in Win95).<br />
      <br />
      Second, it only occurs when using Modern UI.<br />
      <br />
      Third, this bug not occurs in Callback functions (like .onInit), but with custom pages (not tested using common pages, nor the section itself).<br />
      <br />
      Fourth, it isn't linked with Install Options, nor the modification of it, (I tried to call BEFORE calling it, and gave this bug).<br />
      <br />
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      Off of this Banner Plugin bug, EnumRegEnumRegKey and EnumRegValue apparently doesn't work in Win95, is it real? I will test it more, because the last time I tested this was before the installation of lots of Win 95 updates.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi deguix,<br />
      <br />
      could you please submit a simpler script focusing only the bugs you found?<br />
      <br />
      sorry but this thread is somehow confusing me :/<br />
      <br />
      TIA,<br />
