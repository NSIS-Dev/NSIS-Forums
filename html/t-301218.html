      <br>
      that way the user can enable or disable it, which is recommended<br>
      <br>
      also have a look at <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter2.html#2.3.3" target="_blank">Sections</a> for further options

      <p class="post-content">Ok, I figured out where to put it and makes the shortcut, but the shortcut doesn't work. When I click on it, it says that it can't find the file that its supposed to run. I tried a few things like changing the directory and stuff but I don't know what to do from here.<br>
