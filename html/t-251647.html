If you get a CRC error, the answer is there. If you get "Error Launching Installer", the answer is probably there as well, but the problem is different. If you get "Error Launching Installer", then the installer can't read itself.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mrkimir</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd December 2007 14:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Had the same problem,<br><br>discovered that there was a unicode letter (Ä) in the path.

Moving the installer to a location where the path did not contained Chinese characters fixed this.
