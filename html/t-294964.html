      <p class="post-content"><strong>A newbie that tries to pack an installation</strong><br />
      Hello people!<br />
      I have no idea about NSIS scripting and I don't want to.<br />
      I have a simple question:<br />
      I unpacked a NSIS installation and want to repack it using NSIS, how di I di it?<br />
      (I already downloaded &amp; installed NSIS 2.38)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">By "unpack", I assume that to mean you used some 3rd party program (like <a href="http://www.7-zip.org" target="_blank"><u>7-zip</u></a>) to to extract the files? If so, then there's not really any way to "repack" (technically, that's known as "compiling"), since you don't normally get the actual NSI script file from 3rd party programs. (And even if you do, it might not be a complete script file.)<br />
      <br />
      If you did somehow manage to get the script file (and any other external files), you'd be one step further. But, it would be likely that you'd have to modify it to include the proper paths for the files, plug-ins, and other include files.<br />
      <br />
      In either case, it would involve knowing a bit about NSIS first.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The thing is I have a mIRC setup file and I want to silent install it.<br />
      the problem is that the /S switch is unavailable so I need a way to work around it..<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestion?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Unless you get permission from the original author to use and modify his install script, you'll have to write your own script from the scratch. Of course you will also need permission from the original author to redistribute his software, namely mIRC, with your own custom installer...<br />
      <br />
      BTW: If the mIRC setup program doesn't support the /S switch, then most likely it was *NOT* created with NSIS...</p>
