I am currently running it silently using the following syntax:<br><br></p><pre>
<code><br>${If} $VAR1 == "1"<br>ExecWait '"path\to\selfextractor.exe" /s /a /s /sms /f1$EXEDIR\path\to\issfile.iss' $0<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      I used the instructions at <a href="http://unattended.sourceforge.net/installers.php" target="_blank">http://unattended.sourceforge.net/installers.php</a> to find the command-line parameters. For some reason, the "selfextractor.exe" seems to hang in the background (taskman-&gt;processes tab) indefinately, until I end <i>my</i> installer from the task manager. Then the selfextractor executes and installes the third-party product just fine.<br>
      <br>
      Have any of you come across this problem? It seems to happen only with this particular EXE, as the others I include in the installer work just fine.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks in advance,<br>
      Joe

      <p class="post-content">Thank you for the quick reply.<br>
      <br>
      I ran it from the command line like you said, and seemed to ignore both the /H and the /? parameter. I also failed to mention in my previous post that I tested the command as you see it on a virtual machine, just from the command line, and it works fine.<br>
      <br>
      Any other ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the redirect, but this doesn't help me. This gentleman's problem occurred during a silent installation of the NSIS installer, but the normal mode worked fine. I cannot even get the normal mode to work.<br>
      <br>
      I removed the first /s command to confirm that the installation is indeed extracting to the $TEMP directory, which it is, and it appears that the Setup.exe that's extracted does not run until my installer is closed. I hope this helps clarify my problem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Update: the problem still exists when I just use Exec instead of ExecWait. The window shows that the self-extractor is extracting, just like before, and while that is happening the next command in my script is being executed. I run the rest of my NSIS installer normally, and my unattended IS exe only runs <i>after</i> the NSIS installer is closed. Perhaps this behavior is a hard-coded into the IS installer by the third-party company who makes it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Could be, in which case you could call a function in NSIS which puts itself into a loop while your installer.exe is running. You can use the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FindProcDLL_plug-in" target="_blank">FindProcDLL</a> plugin for that.<br>
      <br>
      Like so:<br>
      Push setup.exe<br>
      Call WaitForInstaller<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>Function WaitForInstaller<br>Exch $R1<br>Push $R0<br>Loop:<br> Sleep 1000<br> FindProcDll::FindProc $R1<br>StrCmp $R0 1 Loop<br>Pop $R0<br>Pop $R1<br>FunctionEnd<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Would be an idea to make the installer file name unique, in case the user already has a setup.exe process.<br>
