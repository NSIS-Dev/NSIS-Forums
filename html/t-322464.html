      <p class="post-content"><strong>Repair in Add/Remove Programs</strong><br />
      Hi All,<br />
      <br />
      I've got a NSIS installer that I want to add repair support to. I have set NoRepair=0 in the registry so the Repair button shows up in Add/Remove Programs -&gt; support information, but I don't know what value to create to point to my exe so it gets run when the user clicks Repair.<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone know if this is possible with NSIS? I did a search here and found a few old threads, but none of them seem to have been resolved. One of the threads suggested defining ModifyPath, but that does nothing when the Repair button is clicked.<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!<br />
      Dave</p>

      <p class="post-content">You would need to lie to Windows and create the following value in your ARP information.<br />
      (DWORD)WindowsInstaller=1<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately this also makes the ARP applet actually invoke the Windows Installer (msiexec).. which of course won't work here.<br />
      <br />
      It's one of many ways that Microsoft has been pushing people to use the Windows Installer - as now you have no choice but to use a kludgy solution instead.. letting the user 'remove' your product, but then actually present to the user a dialog that asks them what they -really- want to do.</p>

      </blockquote>Right - but that is cosmetic and while it does clarify to the user that the entry offers both choices, the Applet itself will still only have the 'Remove' button shown/enabled/etc.<br />
      ( I use SAFARP, so I'm not entirely too sure what ARP looks like these Win7 days :) )<br />
      <br />
      MSFT could have easily let other installers be supported by these methods; but alas.<br />
      <br />
      I suppose.. if you -really- wanted to.. you could grab WiX and make a near-empty shell MSI installer which gets handled by the msiexec, and would launch your -actual- NSIS installer/uninstaller. ( or so I presume )
