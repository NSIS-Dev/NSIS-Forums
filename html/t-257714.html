      </blockquote>Sure it does. It will first extract the MSI and then execute it.<br>
      <br>
      I posted my reply after downloading jdk-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.exe and running it. It extracts an MSI file in my %TEMP% folder, which I copied over to a new location, renamed as jdk.msi and run it by hand.<br>

      <br>
      I was able to extract the MSI, but i tries to look for COPYRIGHT file located at c:\progra~1\java\...<br>
      <br>
      On my previous post, I was able to make it work but not in silent installation. Even though I specified the /s for silent mode but /sms work for waiting the installation to complete.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hi CancerFace,<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for the input, but the msi(jdk) didnt launch. Here's the script i used:<br>
      <br>
      ExecWait '$SYSDIR\msiexec.exe /qn /i "$INSTDIR\jdk-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.msi" ADDLOCAL=ALL IEXPLORER=1'<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I've used below syntax to extract the jdk msi:<br>
      <br>
      jdk-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.exe -a -r -f1c:\jdk-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.iss<br>
      <br>
      but the *.iss is no where to be found on drive c:\ but different java msi filename is extracted at c:\</p>
