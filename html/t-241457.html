      </blockquote>Sorry, I thought it would be better to cut down on the number of new threads.<br />

      </blockquote>I couldn't find anything in MSDN, and playing around with a .rc file, it doesn't seem to let you correctly create a new block unless the header item is the language.<br />
      <br />
      Oh well, no big deal. I was curious because I noticed the lavasoft ad-aware installer (non-NSIS) does not have the language info.
