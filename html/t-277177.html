      <p class="post-content"><strong>No progress bar in the UltraModern UI</strong><br />
      I have been playing around with the various interface options and decided to port my test downloader to the UltraModern UI. The only issue I have run across so far is that the download progress bar isn't drawn in the Ultramodern UI. If I use the ModernUI then it works as normal.<br />
      <br />
      Is this a known issue with UMUI?<br />
      <br />
      I am trying to figure out how the UMUI differs in the creation of the window. Running in a debugger, I can see that NSISdl gets something for the HWND of the parent window. I am just not sure which window's handle it is getting because it does all the drawing but there is no control to be seen.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hello,<br />
      <br />
      It is a known issue.<br />
      <br />
      This is a workaround:<br />
      Simply, add this section before all others in your code:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>                Section ""<br />                        SetDetailsPrint none<br /><br />                        Push $0<br />                        Push $8<br /><br />                        FindWindow $0 "#32770" "" $HWNDPARENT<br />                        GetDlgItem $8 $0 1004<br />                        System::Call "user32::InvalidateRect(i,i,i)i (r8, 0, 1).r4"<br /><br />                        Pop $8<br />                        Pop $0<br /><br />                        SetDetailsPrint both<br />                SectionEnd</code>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the help but that didn't seem to work. I notice you are getting a handle to and invalidating the standard install progress bar control. That particular control displays fine. :(<br />
      <br />
      My problem is with the secondary progress bar that NSISdl displays (and I assume other download plugins.) As it is now, NSISdl gets a handle for the two "details" controls and hides them (which works) then creates another static text box and a second progress bar. Both function calls seem to succeed in the debugger (I get handles to the controls) but neither show up! I am wondering if they are behind something but all this is a new world for me - I never did much UI programming.<br />
      <br />
      This issue is the only thing keeping me from using a beautifully skinned installer instead of the same ol' boring thing. After all my pixel pushing this is getting to me! :D<br />
      <br />
      I am looking for something I can do to fix this from within NSISdl. There maybe a way to improve its window handling code so that workarounds aren't neccessary but I start getting nervous when I see all the HWNDs flying around. That esoteric art simply isn't my forte.<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, I found out that (almost) everything works if I remove the "WS_CLIPSIBLINGS" style from the progress bar and static text that NSISdl creates. There doesn't seem to be any flickering and the plugin still works in the old school interface.<br />
      <br />
      I also modified the code to copy the "ctlcolors" structure to the new static text from the old so that the created progress text matches the general theme.<br />
      <br />
      So everything seems to work now, thanks for the help. :)<br />
