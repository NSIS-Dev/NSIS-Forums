      <p class="post-content"><strong>IO problem</strong><br />
      I've noticed something ugly under Windows 98 while using IO.<br />
      If I am writing to the IO ini file just before the IO page loads, in this case - to the listitems for a droplist; then when the page loads, the droplists don't contain anything visual. They appear with the small black square beneath it on mouse-click (which happens when there are no listitems present,) but if I press the down arrow, then the other options I wrote to the listitems actually appear.<br />
      I will use Sleep to pause before the IO page appears, and I'll see if that fixes it.<br />
      <br />
      This is not a problem on my other PC running WinXP-Pro<br />

      <p class="post-content">InstallOptions doesn't read the INI file again after initialization. This is not a problem with timing if when you press the down arrow the items show. Did you set the right height for the droplist?</p>

      The droplist does actually pop out, but behind the component selection box.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If it works on WinXP-Pro, then how can I have the bottom value wrong.<br />
      This is the first time I've used DropLists on my Win98SE machine, so I will try out my other programs which also have DropLists on my Win98SE machine, and see if the problem is still happening.<br />
      <br />
      I'd do it now, but my bro is on the WinXP-Pro machine making Dance music with e-Jay Dance 4! :)<br />
      <br />
      How would I use or do FlushINI?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Don't use FlushINI, you don't need it. Windows XP automatically sizes the drop list to a size that will show all items in the list (or the maximum size which will show at least some and the others with a scroll bar). Windows 9x doesn't do this, it expects you to size the drop list to a suffcient size that will show all of the items. That's why the InstallOptions readme says:<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        Note: For combobox or droplist, the "bottom" value is not used in the same way.<br />
        In this case, the bottom value is the maximum size of the window when the pop-up list is being displayed. All other times, the combobox is automatically sized to be one element tall. If you have trouble where you can not see the combobox drop-down, then check the bottom value and ensure it is large enough.
      </blockquote>If the bottom value is too small the drop list will not be displayed just like in your case.

      <p class="post-content">The tops of the droplists on my IO page are as follows:<br />
      <br />
      1.<br />
      Top=21<br />
      <br />
      2.<br />
      Top=35<br />
      <br />
      3.<br />
      Top=49<br />
      <br />
      What would you recommend I use as the bottom for these droplists?<br />
      Also, is there any reference in the readme's to the size of the nsis default modern dialog?<br />
      <br />
      Edit: ARGH!! I just put the Bottom value to 1000 for each one, and that seems to be fine!<br />
      Sorry for being so darn stupid- I must read things over at least 10 times now :/<br />

      <p class="post-content">Use top + at least 50.<br />
      <br />
      There is no reference, but you can open modern.exe in Resource Hacker and find out.</p>
