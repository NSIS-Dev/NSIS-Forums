      <p class="post-content"><strong>getting the installed program to work for all users rather than the user who installs</strong><br />
      I have to install a program as an admin because I need to look at various system properties. I have the installer ready , the problem I am getting is that a normal user can't use the installed program because he/she does not have rights to read/write to files that the installer(as an admin) copied to the system.<br />
      Is there any flag that I can use to set the installation for any user of the system rather than the user which installs the program.<br />
      <br />
      I was looking through the Help files I and found this command ---&gt; SetShellVarContext<br />
      would this command beenough to make it happen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, 'SetShellVarContext All' makes the $Desktop and such constants point to the 'All Users' directory, however, then normal users cannot change these files.<br />
      <br />
      I just posted 10 mins earlier about this.<br />
      <br />
      but this may not be a problem in your case.<br />
      <br />
      [Edit]<br />
      After re-reading your post, I found that you are asking a slightly different question than I thought, you need to run the installation as administrator, otherwise normal users cannot write to the places you want.<br />
      Using 'SetShellVarContext All' will just make the installation use the All users directory instead of the logged in (or run as) user.<br />
