<code><br>  InitPluginsDir<br>  File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\splash.bmp "splash.bmp"<br>  advsplash::show 4000 640 480 -1 $PLUGINSDIR\splash<br>  Pop $0<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      The problem is, that since I did this, upon opening the installer, a "Please wait while files are extracted"(or similar) messagebox pops up, and it takes maybe a minute for it to count from 0% to 100%, and then show the splash image.<br>
      <br>
      If I <i>remove</i> the splash code, the installer opens <i>immediately</i>.<br>
      <br>
      -If the splash thingy is making the installer this 'heavy', I can't say I think it's worth it.<br>
      <br>
      The image is pretty small(in my opinion) at 640x480, but since it's a .bmp it's at over 1MB still.<br>
      <br>
      I think I read somewhere that one could 'reserve' files, and that that would make the installer 'faster'. Does this apply here? Or would it only make it compile faster?<br>
      I'm using LZMA compression, if that's related.<br>
      <br>
      It seems it has to extract the bitmap on load, and that this process takes maybe a minute.<br>
      <br>
      So is there any way to speed this up?<br>
      <br>
      Why isn't it possible to use a .jpg, btw?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks. :)

      <p class="post-content">you should try reducing the palette of the image to 8bit or lower.<br>
      <br>
      using reservefile should speed up your installer, but make it much bigger.</p>

      </blockquote>This applies exactly to this situation. Use ReserveFile on the top of the script, right after SetCompressor lzma. You should reserve the bitmap.

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the replies, but it doesn't seem to change the fact that it takes 25 seconds to load the splash image on startup(I said a minute, but that was exaggerated - it just <i>feels</i> like 1 min).<br>
      <br>
      I don't think a simple splash image justifies delaying the installer by ~30 seconds(counting the time the splash is visible).<br>
      <br>
      I put SetCompressor at the top of the script like you said, just below !define VER_NAME, which is at the <i>very</i> top.<br>
      <br>
      Like this:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>!define VER_NAME "Name of my installer."<br><br>SetCompressor lzma<br>ReserveFile "splash.bmp"<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      -I'll try to make the image 'smaller' by lowering the color palette, unless there's something else I can do.<br>
      <br>
      -Any way to stretch the splash to cover the entire screen, by the way, like I've seen some installers do?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      UPDATE:<br>
      <br>
      I managed to take the image size down from 1,20MB to 300KB by making it 8bit, but the installer <i>still</i> has to spend quite a few seconds extracting it on startup...

      <p class="post-content">Sorry for the late reply.<br>
      <br>
      Just thought I'd reply to say thanks, it worked when I reserved the advsplash.dll as well.<br>
      <br>
      Now the installer opens right away.<br>
      <br>
      -If others read this thread later and have the same problem, I should add that to reserve the .dll file, I had to copy it from the NSIS plugins folder into my installer folder.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You don't have to move it, you can use:</p>
