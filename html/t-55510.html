I'm one of the developers over at Yaga (<a href="http://www.yaga.com" target="_blank">http://www.yaga.com</a>), another one o' them P2P network dotcom startups. I used NSIS for installation of "Yaga Share", and lemme tell ya, we would never have made it to our current 190k (!) installer without it.<br><br>However, I must say I'm not particularly enamored of NSIS's scripting language. Yeah, it gets the job done, but I feel it could be better.<br><br>But! It is better to light a single candle than curse the darkness. In my spare time, I've cobbled together a prototype for a replacement language. I called it "Angstrom". Its runtime engine is essentially a lightweight FORTH; the current parser also looks like FORTH, but I would probably hide that before it saw the light of day.<br><br>Angstrom currently supports:</p><ul><li>Arbitrarily-named global variables, all-you-can-eat!</li><li>User functions, with named arguments and local variables (also all-you-can-eat), and recursion</li><li>Expanding variables inside strings, like <b>"My name is $foo"</b></li><li>Built-in flow control with <b>if</b>/<b>else</b>/<b>endif</b> and <b>begin</b>/<b>while</b>/<b>repeat</b>; no more labels, real structured programming!</li><li>A variable can be numeric (<b>3</b>) or a string (<b>"foo"</b>), and they are handled differently</li><li>A couple odds and ends thrown in (addition, subtraction, equals, less-than)</li><li>Separate "compiler" and "executor" modules, to minimize runtime size</li><li>Calling out to C functions for easy embeddability</li></ul>As a proof-of-concept, it's already pretty usable. F'r instance, it can tell you how to solve Tower Of Hanoi puzzles :)<br><br>So how big is it? Angstrom currently adds 2290 bytes to my test program. But it's hard to say how much it would change EXEHEAD (the NSIS installer runtime component.) First of all, I can probably squeeze that down a <i>little</i>. Also, keep in mind also that your compiled scripts would probably be smaller with Angstrom (as it's more space-conscious). And there's also a bunch of special-case code in EXEHEAD that I could streamline (like the N different versions of <b>if</b>/<b>else</b>/<b>endif</b>).<br><br>So. How interested would you folks be in such a thing? Should I take the plunge and try and integrate it into NSIS? If Nullsoft weren't interested in the diffs, should I bother making my own alternate release?<br><br><br>Cheers,<br><br><br><i>larry</i></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Gonzotek</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd July 2001 16:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I'd be interested in it. I know that at least one other developer, Edgewize announced plans to "spin-off" another version of NSIS. What you have in mind sounds great for more than just installers. Windows lacks majorly when it comes to scripting...We can use batch files, perl, or other third party resources, but there are few "lightweight" script languages that use a Win32 interface and are powerful enough to be useful. I've been learning Euphoria <a href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com" target="_blank">http://www.rapideuphoria.com</a> , which is a cross-platform language (Linux, Win32, DOS) that has a nice library for building Win32 apps, but an open-source script engine, built on NSIS, would really be cool.<br><br>-=Gonzotek=-<br></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Edgewize</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd July 2001 18:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I've been working on a replacement script syntax for NSIS, basically more of the same token-parsing but with a consistant syntax. I have to say that a full-fledged scriptable langage sounds incredible. Assuming there are still ways to perform basic NSIS functions (like extracting a file ;), I can't see why anyone wouldn't be interested in this!<br><br>My only worry is that it is perhaps too indepth for some projects - for example, a simple self-extracting archive that opens a readme afterwards. So perhaps replacing the original parser with Angstrom is a little premature. But for larger projects I can only imagine some of the benefits a true language would bring.<br><br>I have long been interested in opening a "community-NSIS" site, possibly on SourceForge, where anyone can suggest modifications or improvements. Since I am not likely to go through with this for some time yet, I think you should simply create an independant release (with source code) and tell us where to find it.<br><br>Justin has been incredibly hard to reach for any sort of comment - he never replies to emails or forum posts.

Since most people don't like postfix (which is FORTH's natural state), I'll have to add parenthesis to make things explicit. If I'm not feeling lazy, the result would be:</p><pre>
<code>if (MessageBox("$message" "$title" $MB_YESNO) == $IDYES)</code>
</pre><br>If I am feeling lazy, I'll just leave operators as functions:<pre>
<code>if (Equals(MessageBox("$message" "$title" $MB_YESNO), $IDYES))</code>
</pre><br><br>So I don't think this would be "too indepth for some projects". My hope is that it would be as easy to use as NSIS currently is for such projects.<br><br><b>DuaneJeffers</b>: I'd integrate it into NSIS by removing NSIS's current scripting language, and plugging in mine instead. The result would work just the same as NSIS currently does (same compression, same EXEs), just with a different scripting language.<br><br><b>Gonzotek</b>: I wouldn't suggest using an Angstrom-based NSIS for general-purpose scripting. I expect my result would still be tailored to the domain of installation/uninstallation. For general-purpose scripting under Windows, I suggest Python. It has <i>wonderful</i> integration with Windows, and is plenty powerful, yet it's a joy to program in.<br><br>One more thought. The way Angstrom works internally, it is easy to add new symbols at runtime. I'm thinking I could add an extension DLL interface to NSIS, which would let me move some little-used functionality (Netscape plugins, ActiveX registration) into their own DLLs. The extension DLLs would be stored like regular installed files; the installer would decompress them into a temporary directory and load them. For people who don't use these features, they wouldn't include the DLLs, and adding Angstrom would likely result in a <i>smaller</i> installer. (Well, unless they rebuilt NSIS to disable those features.)<br><br>Cheers,<br><br><br><i>larry</i></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Gonzotek</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th July 2001 17:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Python!

I'm proposing <i>replacing</i> the existing NSIS scripting language with Angstrom, but <i>preserving</i> all the existing functionality.<br><br>So, for instance, right now you'd call:<pre>

Of course, the whole point is to add new functionality at the same time, and I'd be doing that too.<br><br>So: you wouldn't be able to choose between NSIS scripting and Angstrom scripting in the same installer.

And adding a 334K DLL to NSIS, when the NSIS runtime is less than 40K, would be an unpopular move with most NSIS developers.<br><br>Plus, I'm really only proposing replacing the scripting language.

I will point out that if you're interested at all in NSIS, you must be using a Microsoft operating system, and likely you've got other Microsoft products as well. The Windows Setup API is a good idea, even if it's ten years late, and I look forward to the day when I can rely on it being present on users' machihnes.<br><br>On to your other questions.<br><br>Regarding the lack of the <b>Nullsoft Installation System</b> message in the Yaga Share installer:<br>Ah, you caught that. :) Yeah, it always annoys me when other companies enforce their own branding on my product. How many products exist out there where the first thing a user sees when running the installer is something about "InstallShield"? Ewww.<br><br>You bring up a good point, in that I'm probably not the only person that annoys. I could probably make it settable from within the script, so you could change it to your own text, or make it blank, or whatnot.<br><br>As for adding multiple checkbox bitmaps, or a back-end registration database, or how similar will it be to the existing NSIS:<br>Like I said to KennyKen above, I don't want to add tons of new features to NSIS. I'll have enough to do just replacing the scripting language / runtime execution environment. My goal is to make NSIS+Angstrom able to do<br>everything NSIS currently can do, and maybe a little more, and make it much easier to extend with new functions.<br><br>Finally, all the work I've done on Angstrom so far has been on my own time, and I don't expect that to change.
