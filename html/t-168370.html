      <p class="post-content">I don't get it... What's the problem? Do you have a problem with your application name being appended on the selected directory in the browse dialog? Read the documentation about InstallDir, add a backslash at the end of the default directory.<br>
      <br>
      Why are you using both .onVerifyInstDir and MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VERIFYONLEAVE? If MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VERIFYONLEAVE is used, .onVerifyInstDir has no effect.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Your post made me look again at the code and I found a problem there after all. Since RC1 it always appended the application name even if the selected folder name was identical to the application name.<br>
      <br>
      I don't know if that's what you meant or not, but thanks anyway.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm, ok, but how do i use MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VERIFYONLEAVE?<br>
      is this the right syntax:<br>
      !define MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VERIFYONLEAVE "MyVerifyFunction"<br>
      ?<br>
      <br>
      and what's about this:<br></p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm, the directory-selection is still not working correctly:<br>
      <br>
      My default directory looks like that:<br>
      "$PROGRAMFILES\EA GAMES\Battlefield 1942"<br>
      now, this is shown correctly at first at the directorypage.<br>
      then, i search for another path. because no other directory on my system contains the "bf1942.exe", the default-directory is just, what i've to select.<br>
      ok, i select it (D:\Programme\EA GAMES\Battlefield 1942) and press "OK".<br>
      now, at the directory-page there stands:<br>
      "D:\Programme\EA GAMES\Battlefield 1942\Battlefield 1942"<br>
      but this directory doesn't exist on my system!!!<br>
      that's just what i ment with the bug.<br>
      and it's still in the latest cvs.<br>
      <br>
      edit:<br>
      if i select "D:\Programme\EA GAMES", the directory is shown as "D:\Programme\EA GAMES\Battlefield 1942".<br>
      seems as the directory-page always enhances the path with "Battlefield 1942".<br>
      then, that's the bug.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You shouldn't define any value for MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VERIFYONLEAVE, you just define it without any value. When using it, use GetInstDirError in the leave function as instructed in the MUI readme.<br>
      <br>
      You can't remove the new folder button.<br>
      <br>
      There is no compiled version in CVS with the fix yet. You should recompile the latest CVS source code.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, it doesn't disable the next-button, but it disables the ok-button in the selection-dialog, if "abort" is called in this function. that is what the mui-function doesn't do.<br>
      my function looks like that:<br>
      Function .onVerifyInstDir<br>
      IfFileExists "$INSTDIR\bf1942.exe" +2 0<br>
      Abort<br>
      FunctionEnd<br>
      it has the effect that if u select any directory, that doesn't contain "bf1942.exe", the ok-button is disabled.<br>
      it HAS effect :)<br>
      <br>
      edit: i'm in irc now, for further discussing.</p>
