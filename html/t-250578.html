Which means that the installer front-end (the actual installer) is likely passing control to MSIEXEC to run the exctual install.<br><br>Unfortunatley, I haven't been able to locate the actual MSI file. And <a href="http://www.appdeploy.com/packages/detail.asp?id=520" target="_blank">this webiste</a> seems to indicate that the installer EXE passes other parameters to MSIEXEC, making it impposible to run the MSI file directly anyway. <b>edit: At least not without knowing the paramters (which I have not been able to find)</b><br><br>Knowing this, it might be best to check for the presence of the version of QuickTime you require and then offer a polite message to the user that they need to install version x.xx of QuickTime before running your installation.<br><br>And don't forget:<br>Apple requires you to have a license to distribute their products.

Then, in that page's callback function, issue the QUIT command. This will stop the installation.<br><br>(NOTE:<br>The quit command will NOT allow any of your other callback functions to run (such as .onInstFailed). If you require other cleanup functions to run when the installation quits, you'll need to wrap these instructions along with the Quit command inside your own function and then call your special function instead of just issuing a stand-alone quit command.)<br><br><b>Option #2 (assumes you'll use just a MessageBox):</b><br>Check for QuickTime during .onInit. If not installed, perhaps just display a message box letting the user know what's going on followed by the abort command. Probably something like this:<br><pre>
<code><br>Function .onInit<br>   ; *** [check for QuickTime here] ***<br>   ; Pretend $0 = "Y" if Quicktime is installed<br>   StrCmp $0 "Y" QT_YES QT_NO<br>   QT_NO:<br>      ; QuickTime is NOT installed:<br>      MessageBox MB_OK "QuickTime is NOT installed.$\rPlease install it."<br>      abort<br><br>   QT_YES:<br>      ; quicktime is installed:<br>      ; *** Continue your function here ***<br>FunctionEnd<br></code>
</pre>
