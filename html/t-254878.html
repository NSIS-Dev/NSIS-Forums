A user with admin rights should be given the choice how to install. Depending on what choice the user makes the installer should write to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or to HKEY_CURRENT_USER.<br><br>This is expecially important when dlls must be registered, because without admin rights the registration in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT will usually fail. Instead of HKCR one should use either HKLM\Software\Classes or HKCU\Software\Classes.<br><br>Does NSIS provide any support for this?<br>Is there a page that asks this question or must I create one myself? Is there a standard variable to use during installation and uninstallation?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Joachim</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Backland</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th September 2006 16:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I have seen some NSIS installers ask this question using a custom page designed with InstallOptions, but I do not beleive there is a built in page to ask this.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th September 2006 16:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Use InstallOptions to create the dialog and depending on the radio buttons state, SetShellVarContext to <b>all</b> or <b>current</b>.<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">joachim</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th September 2006 23:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for the answers.<br>I managed to create such a custom page, but of course the strings on this page will remain untranslated.<br><br>As for SetShellVarContext I found out, that this information must be saved somewhere, so that it is again available for the uninstall step.

I have to deliver information to the applications that I installed what kind of installation is selected, because they also must access the corresponding registry area. What is the normal way to do this? I suppose that I have to write a registry value under HKLM that corresponds to the selection... Is this the right way?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th October 2009 10:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can use the registry, or write to an ini file in the app's directory, or whatever you prefer.<br><br>Of course if it's a single-user install, you can also use HKCU instead of HKLM.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">TrifonovS</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th October 2009 10:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">If I write to HKCU by installation for the current user only, how the applications will know where to find this registry key (HKCU or HKLM)?
