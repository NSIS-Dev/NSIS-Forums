      The above variable, $1, actually is blank.<br>

      if i were to Pop $R1 right after the UrlOpen, i'd see some sort of transfer error. nothing other specific than that. If it'd work, this would rock, and solve the issue of reading remote files, but, sadly, not working :(

      <p class="post-content">If you are validating a password as I said you should hash it and check that instead. When possible you should always avoid having a copy of the actual password. Also instead of downloading the hash/password, instead POST the hash/password to a web script which does the validation and outputs some success string. Note that this could be bypassed by using a proxy or by changing the hosts file.<br>
