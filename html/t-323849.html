      <p class="post-content"><strong>Possible Security issue w/ NSIS, ******odern UI?</strong><br />
      Hi All,<br />
      <br />
      I just wanted to throw this out there.<br />
      <br />
      I still have to investigate more, but basically, I downloaded the latest<br />
      NSIS and the Ultra Modern UI, all within November, and built a new<br />
      install on my Windows Server 2008 machine, so that I could capture<br />
      some screen shots and test more with the problem of the Welcome<br />
      screen appearing on top of the running Uninstall window.<br />
      <br />
      I ran the Install on another, XP Pro SP3, dev machine, and as soon as the<br />
      Install phase started, I got a pop-up from ZoneAlarm saying that something was<br />
      trying to get out, on the internet, to 80.190.143.232:DNS<br />
      <br />
      I've NEVER seen any NSIS Install get any pop-ups of anything wanting to get out before.<br />
      <br />
      The XP machine has an up-to-date Avira, and no problems with viruses, or malware.<br />
      <br />
      The server just has the stupid Windows Firewall running, which gives no<br />
      warning at all, of course.. :-\ So I installed PC Tools Firewall, and as soon as the<br />
      Install phase starts I got this pop-up:<br />
      <br />
      "NSFEB is attempting to use another process Net Command with parameters (...)"<br />
      <br />
      and if you click on "NSFEB" it gives: ....\Local\Temp\Nsv3ce3.tmp\Nsfeb.tmp<br />
      ( the exact file name changes )<br />
      <br />
      Then it gets pretty much the same pop-up at the end of the Install.<br />
      <br />
      Of course that firewall puts a zillion pop-ups about every interaction<br />
      of apps, but at least it notified me that something was trying to "get out"..<br />
      <br />
      Maybe this is nothing, I don't know, but I've done plenty of installs,<br />
      but not that many with the Ultra Modern UI, and I've never seen any firewall pop-ups.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe I'll try to re-build NSIS from the source, but I don't know.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      P.S. I might have "solved" the issue of the Welcome screen "hiding"<br />
      the running Uninstall window. After the Uninstall starts, I let it go down<br />
      into the Uninstall some, then do a:<br />
      <br />
      Sleep 1500<br />
      <br />
      BringToFront<br />
      <br />
      And brings it back on top of the Welcome screen, for now.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, on the Server, I found out what the two "Net Command"s where,<br />
      those where okay.<br />
      <br />
      At the start of the Install, I sent a command to stop my Service<br />
      and when the Install was finished I sent a command to start the new Service, so that part, on the Server machine anyway, was okay.<br />
      <br />
      But the ZoneAlarm popping up that notification, on the other machine, of something<br />
      wanting to get out was totally different.<br />
      <br />
      Also, I re-installed NSIS and the .zip of the Ultra Modern UI. before I<br />
      downloaded the "combined" NSIS/******odern UI and that overwrote the original<br />
      NSIS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks like your security products might be tripping all over eachother.<br />
      <br />
      Your ZoneAlarm alerted you to a connection to 80.190.143.232 . IP lookup tells me that IP belongs to AVIRA GMBH. So maybe you have some Avira product installed which decided to do an online lookup of.. something? For whatever reason.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, that sounds about right.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe Avira decided to try to get out to do an Update.<br />
      I tried to look-up that IP and got something that seemed<br />
      weird.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry about all this.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!</p>
