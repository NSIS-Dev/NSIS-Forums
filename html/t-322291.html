      <p class="post-content">When you use EM_SETEVENTMASK to set the ENM_LINK event on the RichEdit control, that control will send an EN_LINK notification via WM_NOTIFY to the control's -parent-.. in this case, the inner dialog used by nsDialogs.<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, setting up an NSD_OnNotify on that hwnd doesn't seem to work.. the function supplied is never called, at least.. but maybe I'm doing something stupid.<br />
      <br />
      Using the WndSubClass plugin to catch events on it instead does work, and I can see it grabbing the WM_NOTIFY and detecting clicks (different lparam), but the actual notification sent, in wparam, has a value of 1200.. rather than that of EN_LINK (1803). So I'm not sure what's going on there.<br />
      Edit: Ah - I had a typo somewhere. The EN_LINK does work off of the RichEdit itself - but you'll need to poke at the ENLINK (see below) to figure out whether the user clicked the link or just moused over the thing. Funs.<br />
      <br />
      Then again.. if you then read further into how this is then handled further... the lparam is a pointer to an ENLINK structure. That ENLINK structure has an MNHDR and a bunch of information... none of which are particularly directly useful (i.e. none contain the link clicked as a nice string). Instead, you get to poke about at the charrange structure instead... getting the start/end from that. Then you have to poke at the RichEdit control once again to get the actual text at that start/end range before you have something you could use to open a browser with.<br />
      <br />
      You'd be much easier off just using the built-in license page if you must have the clickable links inside the text... do you have a particular reason for not using a custom one instead?</p>

      </blockquote>I'm guessing you mean that your custom page has an extra print and save button, rather than the license page. However, you could modify the actual license page using a resource editor, and then work with those buttons. The ButtonEvent plugin is an older example of doing something like that:<br />

      </blockquote>I... guess you could if you really wanted to. I'm starting to think (once again) that a Browser control would be more appropriate here.. then you can just stick HTML in there with all its inherent goodness.<br />
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsWeb_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsWeb_plug-in</a><br />
      Might be able to glean from the source what code is used and use System plugin calls instead, but no real need.. the plugin is fairly small.<br />
      <br />
      But, again, if you really wanted to.. there's an EM_FINDTEXT that you could use as a quasi-anchored link (i.e. you click the link, it searches for the correct subsection with the same string, perhaps, further down the document.. would have to be unique, of course) and gives you the beginning/ending char index... then there's EM_EXSETSEL which you can use to select that range (or just select the position at the beginning of that range), combined with EM_SCROLLCARET which scrolls the caret (which should now be at the selecton) into view.<br />
      ( there's also an EM_SETSCROLLPOS, but that takes pixels and I haven't the foggiest how one might get from char index to client-doc pixel coords there. )<br />
      <br />
      But, once more.. Browser control might be better for your exact purposes? ( though the question about links in RTFs has come up several times before, so they'll always have this thread :) )

      <p class="post-content">well that's another reason a browser control might be better ;)<br />
      Although you can set a link on a standard bit of text, the RichEdit control doesn't appear to recognize them straight out of OpenOffice.org re-saved through Wordpad, and inserts the URL behind the linked text.. I think that requires a change to RichEdit 4.1). There's some more SendMessage craziness that -might- set a link on a given selection, but that drops you back to specifying which text should be linked in your installer code.. and I have no idea if that -would- work (haven't tested.. EM_GETCHARFORMAT SF_SELECTED / CFE_LINK | CFM_LINK / EM_SETCHARFORMAT SF_SELECTED ).<br />
      <br />
      One completely hacky way would be to just stick http:// in front of the table-of-content items and make that a tiny-sized font (I think the smallest size you can set directly is 1) and hope nobody thinks that silly ;) Although you could combine that with the above by finding all instances of http:// and hide them entirely through WM_SETCHARFORMAT.<br />
      <br />
      Really, though, Rich Text Files aren't meant for this sort of thing.. hyperlinks were hacked on by MSFT by popular demand.. but you shouldn't expect HTML-like behavior from an RTF :)</p>
