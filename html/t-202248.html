      <p class="post-content"><strong>New line in MUI details view</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I am trying to force a new line in the details view of the installer and have not succeeded.<br />
      <br />
      I first create a string like:<br />
      <br />
      StrCpy $MyVar "This should be one line.$\r$\nAnd another"<br />
      DetailPrint "$MyVar"<br />
      <br />
      I print this to the installation log and it works just fine, but the details view does not break the text at all.<br />
      It just gives "blah, blah, blah ..." if the line is too long. Since you can not scroll over to read it, it would be helpful to be able to force it to wrap or put the breaks in myself.<br />
      <br />
      I have tried '$\n' and '$\r$\n' in the string. Neither worked.<br />
      <br />
      From what I have seen, the installer can do almost anything, so I assume it is my lack of understanding.<br />
      <br />
      While I'm at this -- Thanks to all who have spent many hours developing and supporting NSIS. It was no doubt a labor of love, but lots of labor!!<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">NSIS uses a list view for the details log. It doesn't support line breaks. Why not use two DetailPrint commands?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
      <br />
      I don't use multiple DetailPrint statements because I build the output string in a function and return it by pushing it on the stack as a variable that the main pops. The message built can vary depending on the results, so it might have to be more than one line.<br />
      <br />
      I guess I can put up with it or write a function that parses it.<br />
      <br />
      At least the text log has the breaks.<br />
      <br />
      So I guess "That's the Breaks".<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Couldn't you just DetailPrint it in the function directly as well as output the text from the function...<br />
      <br />
      Outputing the text from the function and then parsing the output would take longer (not really noticably) but it'll still be messy :p<br />
