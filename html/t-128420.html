      <br>
      <br>
      Then in this main installer, add this...<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>exec "d:\mysql\setup.exe" #Executes installer<br>loop:<br>Sleep 2000<br>IfFileExists "$TEMP\mysql.tmp" loop<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So.<br>
      When the installer is extracted and runs, then it will write a mysql.tmp file to the Windows Temp dir. After executing, it will check for the existance of the tmp file, and while it is still there, it will not go to the next secteion, but will keep looping until the tmp file is deleted. As soon as the extracted installer finishes, or is canceled, then the tmp file is deleted. Therefore the main installer will go onto the next section.<br>

      Hope that helps.<br>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>RE: Big problem</strong><br>
      Hello,<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for your help, i will give them a try. Lets assume i don't need to cut my installer into pieces yet (many exe files), My biggest problem is with execwait not being able to wait until mysql installer finish its work before going to another section, i will have problems throughout my entire installer, b/c i am installing zope and apache too, in one giant package.<br>
      <br>
      my ideas over this past weekend were:<br>
      --use messageBoxes all over the place to temporary stop my codes from going any further until the user click on "OK".<br>
      <br>
      -- Use the Sleep command in my code.<br>
      <br>
      I have a question about that before i go any further.<br>
      <br>
      Do you think Sleep would work if i use it right under my 'ExecWait d:\mysql\setup.exe'.<br>
      <br>
      Theoretically, it should wait for so many milliseconds until it continues, RIGHT?<br>
      <br>
      No more ideas after that!<br>

      Hello,<br>
      <br>
      I read it, i actually solved executing mysql db part myself last week. I am putting the chopping my installer apart until later.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for helping me, the links help.<br>
      I like this installer NSIS, if it could be more powerful than this, then i will like it even more. It seems that i am running into all kinds of problems but luckily, i find my way out for a few things . For me its rush time, i don't think i can learn to use other installer and use them for this project in little time i have.<br>
      <br>
      I will post my overall codes onto this post soon. It has gotten Huge!!!<br>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Way to execute mysql.exe to load in DB!</strong><br>
      hello,<br>
      <br>
      My installer is 90% finished and tested, Found alternative way to do things, unfortunately am still stuck with inserting db sql files into mysql during run time.<br>
      <br>
      i am using either Exec or nsExec::Exec.<br>
      <br>
      Code:<br>
      StrCpy $R1 "c:\mysql\bin\mysql Db &lt; dump.sql"<br>
      <br>
      Exec "$R1"<br>
      Will not work so does<br>
      nsExec::Exec "c:\mysql\bin\mysql Db &lt; dump.sql"<br>
      <br>
      Even if i tried to seperate it:<br>
      Code :<br>
      StrCpy $R1 "C:\mysql\bin\mysql"<br>
      StrCpy $R2 "db &lt; dump.sql"<br>
      <br>
      Exec or nsExec::Exec "$R1 $R2"<br>
      <br>
      Can someone please give me a working code for this minor problem, i have tried many combinations.<br>
      it just will not run during runtime.<br>
      <br>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hello</strong><br>
      Hello Kichik,<br>
      <br>
      thank you for the Links,<br>
      <br>
      Believe me, i read them and tried them all out as far as the DB-&gt;Mysql goes. They still will not work. I am not kidding. Inside the installer at runtime, the Db-&gt; mysql part gets Skip even it said that it executed that section.<br>
      <br>
      i even tried:<br>
      mysql -u root -e "\. file.sql" dbname<br>
      inside my batch file and directly execting it inside the istaller, it will not work.<br>
      <br>
      Once i seperate just the DB-&gt;mysql part<br>
      any user can click on it and it will work, but it won't budge inside the entire installer during runtime.<br>
      <br>
      I like this installer NSIS, i won't have time to learn to use another one, or learn how to call other installers at runtime.<br>
      <br>
      i got the wait to work using 'Sleep'.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      This code works. Nothing skips. Have you tried it?<br>
      <br>
      If you want help you'll have to give some more details, example sciprts of what you've read in the links and doesn't work and the errors you get because currently all I am getting from you is nothing works everytime and the amount of information in there is zero.
