      The Reg key will replace the InstallDir with what the user has placed instead.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Duane. It's the "now that I know the app is installed, dont run the NSIS installer, but run the app instead" part that I can't seem to get to work. I do have the app launching after the install is complete just fine.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Do something like this:</p>
      <pre>
<code>InstallDir $PROGRAMFILES\MyApp<br><br>function .onInit<br>ReadRegStr $0 HKLM "Software\MyApp" "InstallPath"<br>StrCmp $0 "" Done<br>Exec "$0\MyApp.exe" it is installed! so run the program!<br>Quit<br>Done: ; So not installed? continue install then!<br>functionend<br><br>section<br>; some install stuff<br>sectionend<br><br>section ; do not forget to write the regkey<br>; to know next time that it is installed<br>WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\MyApp" "InstallPath" "$INSTDIR"<br>sectionend</code>
</pre><br>
      To autorun, create a file "autorun.inf" containing this:
      <pre>
<code>[autorun]<br>open="path to app" ; replace!<br>icon="icon file"   ; replace!</code>

      I would think you would want the installer to run if the file is not there.

      <p class="post-content">My solution is intended to run the program on harddisk if installed. Otherwise the installation will continue. So no aditional installation needed that should be run.

      <p class="post-content">A solution to the problem that people delete applications instead of uninstalling them could be this: if no regkey -&gt; just install. If the regkey is present -&gt; present an InstOpts dialog asking to "reinstall" or "run" (and maybe even "uninstall") and where run is default. This way this problem would have been solved.<br>
