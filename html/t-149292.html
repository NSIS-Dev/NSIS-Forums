The problem you're having is probably caused by unloading the plug-in in the leave function which is called when processing a windows message. That message is sent to the dialog by no other but your own plug-in. When the control returns to your plug-in's code it's no longer there, and that causes the crash.

seem to like doing when the hook function is in the dll calling it (though it works fine under all other oses tested :hang: ).<br><br>the reason for this was trying to drop the need for a /NOUNLOAD to

      <p class="post-content">It seems there are still several "problems" of this plugin together with the Modern UI:<br>
      <br>
      (1)The button is not displayed the XP styled way.<br>
      (2)It seems that every window-refresh unloads the button espeacially a refresh of an InstallOptions-Dialog, so u have to call the HelpButton::show - method at least in every show and leave-function.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway - keep up the good work.<br>

      <br>
      <a href="http://www.nunzioweb.com/daz/nsis/releases/HelpButton_v1_0_RC1.zip" target="_blank">download 1.0 RC1</a><br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=379" target="_blank">archive reference page for 0.9 sytnax</a><br>
      <br>
      main changes are that you can now use /help to use chm files <font size="1">e.g.</font> "/help=${NSISDIR}\nsis.chm"<br>
      <br>
      as well it's now possible to specify the top left corner of the window as <b>"x,y"</b> or <b>center</b> (centers in the middle of the desktop) or <b>centerp</b> (centers in the middle of the installer).<br>
      <br>
      and also the size of the window can be set via <b>"width,height"</b> after the top left corner value.<br>
      <br>
      until it's documented/tweaked any of the new parts not used need to be set as "" in the script where you'd otherwise place the information. depending on feedback, etc i'll potnetially modify this and i will update the help file about this in the next day or so<br>
      <br>
      syntax example:<br>
      <b>HelpButton::show /NOUNLOAD "232,231" "?" "" "/help=${NSISDIR}\nsis.chm" "" "" "centerp" "500,500"</b><br>
      <br>
      this will place a '?' button to the left of one of the 'back' button in a classic UI installer and open the nsis.chm file centered over the installer window and 500x500 pixels in size<br>

      <p class="post-content">HansH: cool, good to hear it's working for you. i've been trying to get to a 1.0 state with it for almost a year now so it's good to know the updates haven't screwed things up too much :)<br>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Window size using html</strong><br>
      Using version 1.0RC1 (and older) I can't get the html helpwindow large enough. I'm using: HelpButton::show /NOUNLOAD "232,231" "?" "" "/html=xxx.html" "" "" "centerp" "800,800"<br>
      It's as if there is a max limit for the window size.<br>
      Is it possible to fix?</p>

      <p class="post-content">there shouldn't be a limit with the size (from the plugin side of things). the only thing i can think of is that the html help window enforces a size limit itself but without looking into this i can't say for certain. will try and look at it over the weekend (and update the wiki page as well)<br>

      <p class="post-content">Has anyone tested this plugin with Windows 7/ Vista and the latest nsis version. 5 Years are a loooong time.<br>
      I will give it a try, or are there already any other possibilities to give the user an extra information window? (The user needs to choose between several installing options which can't be explained in the short description box)<br>
      <br>
      The Help Button shows up after 3 seconds, don't know why it takes so long?<br>
      Does anyone has a complete documentation for 1.0 or could tell me what's important to set?<br>
      <br>
      The screen size of the html is always the same, can't make it bigger. It's opened on the upper left corner of the desktop.<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code>Function helpCombo<br> HelpButton::show /NOUNLOAD "300,100" "?" "" "/html=c:\gps\gpsbabel.html" "" "" "centerp" "1024,768"<br>FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      --&gt; should open in the center of the installer window, but it's on upper left coprner of the desktop<br>
      --&gt; should be 1024 x 768, but it's only about 150 x 150<br>
      --&gt; using MUI2.nsh<br>
      <br>
      Can I insert an html link instead of this help button, so that a browser window is opened? maybe this would be easier?

      <p class="post-content">i've never tested it on Vista/Win7 (no idea if anyone else has) but i don't think i've even got the source code for this anymore (and it'd need a complete re-code anyway to make it compatible with ansi and unicode installers that are now available). however it's been so long since i've done NSIS plug-in coding i don't think i'm going to have the time to make a new version.<br>
      <br>
      as for the size limits it sounds like it's an issue with the plug-in's ability to control the html control (though i had thought it allowed for larger sizes when i'd developed it so maybe something with the IE web browser control has changed, dunno).<br>
      <br>
      you might be able to make a link control with nsDialogs and go that way, am sure i'll be corrected if i'm wrong, heh<br>

      <p class="post-content">thanks for your quick answer!<br>
      Ok, that's good to know. I will try it with nsdialogs or the linker plugin.</p>
