      <p class="post-content"><strong>setoverwrite by version</strong><br />
      In the past, I have used InstallShield and it had a way to specify file overwrite by (VERSION | DATE) where a file would be overwritten if the new file had a greater version than the old file, independent of the date/time stamp. I assumed, wrongly I believe, that the 'SetOverwrite ifnewer' would take file version (if avaible) into account. Is there a simple way to ensure that a file is overwritten if the source file has a newer version than the destination?<br />

      You can set "SetOverwrite on" - and it will be always overwritten. If file is blocked (by system, or currently is running) - installer will notify you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I realize that, but I only want to override if the file is newer. I would like the definition of 'newer' to be 1) first version 2) then date if necessary. If this does capability not exist, it seems like a nice feature that shouldn't be too dificult to implement. I am hoping, though, that I missed a simple mode/setting to accomplish my goal</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can use GetDLLVersion and GetDLLVersionLocal to do the version comparsion. You can use the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixB.html#B" target="_blank">Library</a> or the older UpgradeDLL macro to do this comparison for you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, I have used those functions/macros primarily for updating system DLLs. I was just hoping that I missed some capability in the File command that would allow more control over overwriting files. It seems that I did not miss anything and will need to use something other than the File command to update my files.</p>
