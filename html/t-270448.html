      <p class="post-content"><strong>Directory Constants on Japanese XP</strong><br />
      I have an installer that I'm attempting to run on a Japanese system, but the predefined constants $SMPROGRAMS, $DESKTOP, $STARTMENU, and $SMSTARTUP (and possibly some others) all wind up pointing to the wrong location: the user's folder in the Documents and Settings folder.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not doing anything special, and I have a test script that just calls SetShellVarContext current, followed by a DetailPrint of each string, so I can see what they're supposed to be.<br />
      <br />
      Any idea why this should be happening? Does anyone else have this problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I just tried this on a Japanese system, and the constant values were correct for me. Are you running a true Japanese OS or another OS that has been set to Japanese?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I compiled and ran, and it displayed correctly for me. I'm testing on a Japanese XP VPC image. I had to comment out this:<br />
      !include "CMSLIb.nsh" ; CrystalMaker functions.<br />
      !insertmacro GetContextDocsFolder<br />
      <br />
      Unless that is causing the issue, it could be your instance of a Japanese system. NSIS has had multi-lingual support for a while now. VPC is now free, so if you confirm that it's your system causing the problem, you could install VPC to do your development and testing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You don't have to compile the thing on the Japanese system itself, do you? I built mine on a stock English system and copied the binary over.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Correct, you can compile on an English system. My last comment was confusing. I meant you could use VPC to test with, not to actually do your script development on.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I ran a repair from the installation DVD and now everything works fine. My guess is the problem occurred when I tried to install a video driver for this laptop awhile ago and the installation failed.<br />
