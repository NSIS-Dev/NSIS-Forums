The reason is when you build it does a find in the script for the output file name (outfile "xxx"), it first sets a bookmark to the current cursor position and returns to that bookmark once it has found the file name. If however you've used the mouse wheel you haven't moved the cursor just the view.<br><br>What I've done is add an option to make the cursor follow the scrolling.
