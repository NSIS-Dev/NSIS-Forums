      <p class="post-content"><strong>What's Wrong With Turkish Language Support?</strong><br />
      I've just downloaded and installed (clean install) 2.18 but there is a problem with Turkish lang support. I've noticed in the changelog that, some updates have been done on Turkish lang file. But there is something wrong cause some characters don't seem correct. Please refer to the picture i've attached to this post, it's an installer made by modern UI example script...<br />
      <br />
      I've look into Turkish translation files which are in the Contrib folder but all the words, letters seems to be ok.<br />
      <br />
      Can you please tell me what can i do?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not an expert with nsis, so i couldn't what you meant :)<br />
      <br />
      But i can say, i've installed nsis and gone to "Program Files\NSIS\Examples\Modern UI" and compiled that MultiLanguage.nsi file. Then tested it but i've seen that there is something wrong with Turkish language support.<br />
      <br />
      Any solution or any code to add that multilang example script to run it properly?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The language for non-Unicode applications is defined in the Regional and Language Options control panel. It's a Windows setting that determines the ANSI codepage used to convert non-Unicode text into Unicode that can be displayed on screen. If you select the wrong language, you'll get the wrong Unicode text.<br />
      <br />
      There's no simple code you can add to the installer that'd make the text display correctly with the wrong codepage. The solution is the Regional and Language Options control panel.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I solve this problem just open Turkish lang file with notepad and change Language code Win-1254 (C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\)</p>
