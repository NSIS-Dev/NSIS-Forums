      There are three buttons at the final screen (Exit, Options, Close), two of them greyed (Exit and Options), how could I activate them and write a function for them?</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol, yes I am talking about NSIS :)<br />
      <br />
      Afrow UK, let's see if you can help me a bit, because the example in that plugin is too complex for me.<br />
      <br />
      3 is the control id of the greyed button "Options", I put this code as a function that loads the page where the button is:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code> Function MyGUIInit<br />  # Create event handler for our parent window button.<br />  ButtonEvent::AddEventHandler /NOUNLOAD 3<br /> FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      and then I put this other code as a function when the page is left.<br />
      <pre>
<code> Function ComponentsLeave<br />  # Find out if one of our buttons was just pressed.<br />  ButtonEvent::WhichButtonID /NOUNLOAD<br />   Pop $R0 # Control ID of button user pressed.</code>
</pre><br />
      and that's all, then the greyed button should do what the function ComponentsLeave says, did I understood correctly?

      Yes that code is correct, but I wouldn't recommend using the back button though (because it belongs to the installer), but try it anyway it should still work.<br />
      <br />
      $R0 in your leave function will be 3 if your button is pressed or -1 otherwise. A simple StrCmp (or ${If}) will allow you to execute NSIS code accordingly.<br />

      <p class="post-content">this is the code I used with the previous functions:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>Page InstFiles "EnterInstall" "" "ExitFunction" </code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      the problem is that the ExitFunction is loaded before the user can even click on a button.<br />
      <br />
      Remember that I am trying to activate the buttons on the final page of the installer, which I couldn't find a page name for it, and hence I used "InstFiles".

      <p class="post-content">ok, after almost four years, I attempt to do it again :P<br />
      <br />
      is it possible to make clickable the button which in this screenshot is called "enrera"?<br />

      because I am not sure if what the plugin ButtonEvent is made for this purpose.<br />

      </blockquote>Ok, great, no need to edit the UI. I read it in the readme and I was wondering if I should still have to edit it.<br />
      <br />
      Next.<br />
      <br />
      What does it mean to "use ButtonEvent on both" which both? I don't understand what "both" are you refering to. Also, how to use ButtonEvent on them? Do you mean both buttons? The close button and the one I am interested?<br />
      <br />
      I am using the default UI. So, what I have is this page with the leave function and the grey button I want to use.<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code>Page InstFiles "EnterInstall" "" "ExitFunction" </code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      I am trying to read the examples, but I get lost easily.<br />
      <br />
      So, what I have to do is activate the grey button and put the ButtonEvent code somewhere so I can compare $R0 on the leave function and if it's 3 then use the code I want for that button.<br />
      <br />
      Now, if you can help me a little bit further... thanks

      <p class="post-content">Yes try on both buttons. I understand what you are trying to do by using a leave function but you don't have to do it that way. You can just use callbacks on each button instead via ButtonEvent.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I have tried and all I can suggest is you add another button (i.e. ID of 4) over the top of the Back button with Resource Hacker and only show it on the InstFiles page. For the previous and next pages you will need to hide the button again (add a Show functions for both).<br />

      <pre>
<code>Page Components HideMyBackButton<br />Page InstFiles ShowMyBackButton<br />Page SomeOtherPage HideMyBackButton<br /><br />Function HideMyBackButton<br />  GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 4<br />  ShowWindow $0 ${SW_HIDE} ; WinMessages.nsh<br />FunctionEnd<br /><br />Function ShowMyBackButton<br />  GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 4<br />  ShowWindow $0 ${SW_SHOW} ; WinMessages.nsh<br />FunctionEnd</code>
