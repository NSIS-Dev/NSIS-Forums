      <p class="post-content"><strong>SkinnedButton 1.21 development version</strong><br />
      Hi everybody,<br />
      <br />
      after quite some tedious work, I have a new version ready for testing. It still contains quite some diagnostic code so don't bother about the size ;) This version of the dll performs proper skinning of bigtest.nsi with the UltraModernUI, without additional tweaks to the NSIS sources. Well, at least for me it is working now ;)<br />
      <br />
      So I'm asking everybody who is interested in skinned buttons to test the plugin and check if really all buttons will be skinned properly now. If you find some that won't work, please tell me :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The message box is a system message box which is created as another top-level window, not as a child window, so I can't skin it directly. I'll see what I can do about that. The unskinned back button on the next page is astonishing, though. Up to now, I just played with the UltraModernUI which has an integrated message box pane - so this bug does not show up at all. Thanks for the feedback, gotta see what I can do about the additional top level window.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, I can now skin the message box button. The method of wansis and skinnedbutton plugins are not sufficient to accomplish this, so I stripped a lot of code and rewrote most of the rest. The only strange thing is that after clicking the message box button, the back button becomes unskinned again *big sigh*<br />
      <br />
      Oh, btw, should the large "Click me!" button become skinned too? It looks pretty ugly *g*</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, the "Click me!" is a html link, isn't it?<br />
      By the way, I can skin all of them now, except for "Click me" and I have to fix some redraw issues. Put it in the background and bring it to the foreground again and everything looks okay *sigh*</p>

      <br />
      If you followed my old instructions, you have to edit ui.c from the NSIS sources and recompile NSIS to get the exehead files with the required modifications. With these modifications, the Show Details button will be skinned and the Next button too. But this is already outdated by now. I've implemented a new way of skinning buttons, I just have some minor problems with keeping an eye on childwindows and some window refresh problems I don't fully understand by now. I can launch the test.exe and it looks misdrawn, place another window in front of it and when I remove the other window, test.exe looks okay. So everything gets drawn nicely, just not at the right time ;)<br />
      <br />
      I've broken some bits while implementing the new system for the messageboxes. I have to re-implement the skinning for childwindows completely. That means I'll still use the draw routines from wansis but that's about all that's left from the old skinnedbutton plugin. A lot of new code has been integrated.</p>

      <br />
      I am impatient to see that, and in particular the source code.<br />

      If you could add some comments for the comprehension in the source code, that would help me much to understand it...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, simple but effective fault. I forgot to replace the debug version of the dll with the release version. Most systems out there have no debug runtime dlls installed, that means loading of the skinnedbutton.dll fails and thus no skinned buttons at all. Find the correct version attached, please :)<br />

      And BTW, SuperPat45: Please shrink the picture in your signature a bit, it voids the forum formatting :(</p>

      <br />
      Now what SkinnedButton can skin the messagebox buttons,<br />
      <br />
      Would be possible to make small NSIS plug-in making possible to change the text color and the background color of the messagesbox?<br />
      (il would make very pretty with UltraModernUI and SkinnedButton)?</p>

      Hi<br />
      I made installer with full background image and I would like to use your plugin with<br />
      XPStyle turned ON<br />
      <br />
      Check my topic: <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=251710" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....hreadid=251710</a><br />
      <br />
      But I did it with XPStyle off ........<br />
      <br />
      Could you fix it to work with v XPStyle turned ON ?<br />
      <br />
      It would greatly help me</p>
