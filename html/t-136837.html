      <p class="post-content"><strong>Help with my function</strong><br />
      I re-wrote this script <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=300&amp;instances=0,11" target="_blank">here</a> after finding that it sometimes goes into a infinite loop (and crashes my installer)<br />
      Right now, I found out that it never replaces the last occurence of text, no matter what I do.<br />
      <br />
      I'm currently using:<br />
      <br />
      Push "cls$\r$\n"<br />
      Push ""<br />
      Push "1"<br />
      Push "all"<br />
      Push "${INSTDIR}\compile.bat"<br />
      Call AdvReplaceInFile<br />
      <br />
      So, my script will use these and it should replace like so...<br />
      cls$\r$\n<br />
      cls$\r$\n<br />
      cls$\r$\n<br />
      cls$\r$\n<br />
      ...becomes...<br />
      cls$\r$\n<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      cls$\r$\n<br />
      See that it always leaves another "cls$\r$\n" on the end, when it is not meant to.<br />
      Can anyone find out what is either wrong with the script, or what I should do to fix this problem.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks<br />
      <br />

      Edit:<br />
      I think it would be a good idea to add a "Text file manipulation" directory on the archive, unless it's ok that I create one myself?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You are more than welcome to create directories yourself. Do whatever you want, if you're not allowed the Archive should stop you :) (don't quote me on that :P)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok thanks :)<br />
      I'm still not sure why it is not writing the last line down though (or removing it in my case)<br />
      <br />
      Maybe it's just because in the example I was <i>testing</i> under, it's because it <i>is</i> the last line of the file, and IfErrors is bypassing it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">How would I go about adding a subdir within the "Useful Functions" section?<br />
      I would like to add "Text file manipulation" as a subsection within the "Useful Functions" section.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry if I am sounding stupid, but I don't want to make a mess of anything :p<br />

      <p class="post-content">To add a directory to the archive go to Contribute and choose "a new section that can contain other pages."<br />
      <br />
      I'll have a look at the script and tell you if I find anything.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think the problem in the script is in the loop_filter label. The first comparison you do there is with a copy of $7 minus the last character. While this will work for lines where the last character is not a line break it won't work for the last line that probably doesn't have a line break after it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You are right!<br />
      Anyone know how I would go about fixing this?<br />
      <br />
      Edit: Made the new section, and put all the scripts in.<br />
      Could somone delete the old ones for me?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Afrow, just start the counter from -1 :)<br />

      About the sections in the archive you should be able to delete the instances yourself assuming the pages were created by you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">LOL<br />
      I was able to insert other peoples' pages into my section, but I couldn't delete the old ones (made by me) because it said I need administrator rights!<br />
      <br />
      Edit; ok I changed StrCpy $5 -1 and it still doesn't work, unless you mean something else?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yes, thats what I thought.<br />
      The only thing is, once $5 becomes 0, doesn't $6 become ""?<br />

      <p class="post-content">No since 0 is the same as "" and is the same as not specifying anything which never results in "".</p>

      <p class="post-content">It didn't work using $5 as 1, it stops any lines being changed in the file at all.<br />
