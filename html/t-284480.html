ModernUIEx is an extended version of Modern UI but with the new UltraModern pages support.<br># UltraModernUI included henceforth three plugins that are supported natively :<br>* The SkinnedControls plugin. SkinnedControls is based on the wansis plug-in of Saivert and can skin all buttons of your NSIS installer like the most recent installers as well as the scrollbars (only for Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista).<br>* The InstallOptionEx plugin. InstallOptionEx is writen by Diego Pedroso (deguix) and is an expanded version of InstallOptions containing many new features, with size drawback. This unofficial version, by SuperPat, contain a lot of bugfix necessary to the correct operation of some UltraModernUI pages.<br>* The NSISArray plugin. This plug-in written by Afrow UK, allows the support of the array in NSIS. It comes with plenty of functions for managing your arrays. This plugin is used with the AlternativeStartMenu and MultiLanguages Pages of UltraModernUI.<br><br># All the Skin were remakes and twenty skins are now available. blue, blue2, SoftBlue, red, red2, SoftRed....<br><br># Twenty background skins are now available. blue, blue2, SoftBlue, red, red2, SoftRed....<br><br># New pages are available:<br>* MultiLanguage Page if you want to replace the MultiLanguage Plug-in.<br>* Maintenance Page with Repair, Modify, Uninstall and Continue Setup options.<br>* Update Page with Update, Uninstall and Continue Setup options.<br>* Informmation Page for viewing text and RichText files.<br>* SerialNumber Page.<br>* Setup Type Page with Minimal, Standard, Complete and Custom options.<br>* AlternativeStartMenu Page to replace the StartMenu Plug-in. It allow to use a TreeWiew instead of the ListView and can set the ShellVarContext<br>* Additional Tasks page.<br>* File and Disk Request Page.<br><br># Left Text, Left Time and LeftMessageBox functions are removed.<br><br># UltraModernUI is translated into two languages English and French an partially translated into German and Brazilian Portuguese.<br><br><br><b>TODO:</b><br><br>- The documentation is outdated and the SkinnedControls plugin documentation is non-existant. So you can see examples to see all properties.<br>- Need to rewrite one of the macros managing "UMUI Flags" (It allows, among other things, what options were chosen in the different pages ...).<br><br><br><b>I need your help for:</b><br><br><b>- Your feedback</b><br><b>- The translation of UltraModernUI into the other languages</b><br><b>- Creation of more skins</b><br><b>- The corrections of some InstallOptionsEx plug-in bugs:</b><br>* Transparent Icons are not transparent in the page...<br>* Button are not drawn if we use SkinnedControls plugin... whereas that work very well with InstallOptions.<br><b>- Improvement for SkinnedControls plug-in:</b><br>* Skin checkboxs and radiobuttons<br>* Skin progress bars<br>* Skin dropLists arrow<br><br>I plan to release the final version in March, 20th, the third anniversary of the release of the first version<br><br>Thanks in advance for your help.<br><br><br><b><a href="http://guerin45.free.fr/UltraModernUI/" target="_blank">Download</a></b></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Yathosho</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th January 2008 14:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">can help with a translation into german</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th January 2008 16:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Any plans to update it to the Modern UI version 2.0?

</pre><br>
      <br>
      I've been looking at both the UMUI.nsh and LogicLib.nsh and the error is correct, on line 61 of the UMUI.nsh you have<br>
      <br>
      !define CONTINUE 512 ; set by MAINTENANCE and UPDATE pages<br>
      <br>
      and on line 582 of the LogicLib.nsh it has the define<br>
      <br>
      !define Continue `!insertmacro _Goto Continue "For or Do or While"`<br>
      <br>
      I think you may have to change your Continue to something else<br>

      <br>
      When I install the "combined" NSIS + UMUI, it erases the NSIS package, and installs only a few of the packages in NSIS, so a lot of plugins are missing!<br>

      <blockquote>
        My "pre" function that calls INITDIALOG still has the problem where any custom pages do not have their backgrounds drawn correctly...
      </blockquote>If you want your page will be automatically skinned you have to use the INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY or INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY_RETURN macros.<br>
      The init dialog doesn't do this because if you set your own color into your pre function thes will be erase by the INSTALLOPTIONS_SHOW, INSTALLOPTIONS_SHOW_RETURN macros.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      For the confirm page, I don't know why it is not skinned because th page use the INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY macro. Can you send your example script?

      It has the same issue. It conflicts with the name in LogicLib.<br>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>You should prefix any constants used by UMUI with UMUI_ or something similar. This way, there'd be no collisions with built-in stuff like LogicLib.

      Hi!<br>
      i would like to know how to use the new PageEx called<br>

      Has someone a working example on this page?<br>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>testing beta2</strong><br>
      Thanks for the reply, now it is working properly. UMUI beta2 has a lot of cool features, but I also noticed a serious problem: speed. I was playing with the preset examples provided with UMUI. Testing on a Pentium Dual Core computer having 3GB memory(!) it took me around 10-15 seconds to display the serialnumber page. The frame of the page gets loaded before the setup gets frozen. If you turn everything off in Function serial_function, it won't get frozen at all. Whenever turning a LABELEDSERIAL on (with its define), it takes longer and longer to load the page. Other pages - like the maintenance - also take a bit of time to load.<br>
      Something seems to me to be broken in the example with Update page. i built the example, installed it, tried to install it again, and there was no Update page displayed. The registry keys were created properly. It should resemble Maintenance page example, which is working properly.</p>

      </blockquote>Salut SuperPat,<br>
      <br>
      My custom pages are working fine with the INIT/SHOW approach.<br>
      <br>
      I have one 'standard' page, which I launch with a PRE function. As a result the page, actually the components page, background is 'old style' grey. Here is the code snippet:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>; Welcome page<br>!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_WELCOME<br><br>; Components page<br>;!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_COMPONENTS &lt;- not used<br>Page components oninst.CheckInstalledJRE "" ""<br>...<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      If I ignore the Java check and use the stock !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_COMPONENTS everything is fine. I can't seem to find a way to do it when I launch the page in this manner:<br>
      <br>
      Page components preMacro "" ""<br>
      <br>
      Is there some way to fix this?<br>
      <br>
      Merci!!!

      </blockquote>That would be true if I were using a 'custom' page with a corresponding .INI file. But I am not. I am using the Components page as defined by the UMUI, but calling it in a different manner than with INSERT_MACRO_XXX.<br>
      <br>
      I rewrote the java function and now include it in my on.init, however, it would have been cleaner the other way around, espeically to be able to re-run the function automatically if the user backs up to the components section from a later page.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for your response...and thanks for the documentation...you rock!<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      PS just a thought on the flickering scroll bar during the INSTFILES phase...perhaps you could resize the scroll button fewer times, and therefore redraw the scroll bar fewer times?? My app installs over a thousand files...so the flickering is quite intense.

      Hi!<br>
      <br>
      Thx for the new release, meanwhile I got the Update example working as well.<br>
      I found a serious bug in UMUI_PAGE_MULTILANGUAGE. Compared to MUI, function .onInit gets called twice if you use this page. First before the page gets displayed and secondly if the selected language of the combobox was changed. This misbehaviour can have a side-effect, for example my script was detecting in .onInit if it was already running, and if yes, it aborted itself. Since .onInit gets called twice, it aborted itself whenever I changed the setup language to other than the default...</p>

      <p class="post-content">In fact, when you choose an other language, the installer is reloaded:<br>
      <br>
      You can bypass your ckecking by adding this code in your .onInit function:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code>Function .onInit<br><br>        !insertmacro UMUI_MULTILANG_GET<br><br>        !insertmacro UMUI_IF_INSTALLFLAG_ISNOT ${UMUI_LANGISSET}<br><br>        ; Check if installer is already lauched only the first time<br><br>        !insertmacro UMUI_ENDIF_INSTALLFLAG<br><br>        ; Eventualy other code<br><br>FunctionEnd</code>

      Hi again<br>
      <br>
      Thx for the solution for .onInit, it works. I noticed that the new InformationPage cannot use licenselangstrings (or langstrings) instead of file names like license page. Do you know a solution to make it multilingual (to display a separate information file for each language)?</p>

        <p class="post-content">Thanks, the new Information page works properly!<br>
        <br>
        Now I wish you could somehow solve the slowness of SerialNumber page. After a bit of googling I found this page: <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=2051082" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=2051082</a> which indicates that using ReserveFile can improve performance.<br>
        <br>
        I was playing a bit with WriteINIStr, this function is called relatively frequently (7 times in UMUI_SERIALNUMBERPAGE_ADD_LABEL for instance). It only adds a value for an entry to a section in an INI file if it does not contain it, otherwise it rewrites the entry. This means that it has to scan through the whole file..</p>

        <p class="post-content">I have found another bug, or probably i am just too dumb to use it.<br>
        <br>
        If you look at the attached images (in the .rar) for<br>
        <br>
        Image1.png i used<br>
        <br>
        !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_BGCOLOR transparent<br>
        <br>
        and for Image2.png it was:<br>
        <br>
        !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_BGCOLOR FFFFFF<br>
        <br>
        The problem as you can see with the transparent setting is that the Groupbox line shows through, if i use FFFFFF the second line under the Directory Picker has a white Background.<br>
        <br>
        Is it possible to have the line of the group box disappear AND to have all the labels on the page with a transparent background?<br>

        <p class="post-content">Yes but it is not an UMUI bug,<br>
        MUI_BGCOLOR don't work with transparency because it is not possible to hide the bar of groupbox<br>
        And for the label that change like in components, directory and installfile pages, the new text is written on the top of the old text and become unreadable.<br>
        <br>
        Only the solution I know is to use a background image having plains colors at the position of theses labels</p>

        <p class="post-content">Hi!<br>
        <br>
        Apparently "!define MUI_LANGDLL_ALWAYSSHOW" doesn't work to force the installer to display the multilanguage page. The language selection will be skipped, if the language is stored in registry! How can I make the installer to ALWAYS show the multilanguage page? Also using a multilanguage page in an <i>UN</i>installer won't work. I get an error message as soon as I switch the language...<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        I will do it for the next release.<br>
        while awaiting, you can remove the define UMUI_LANGUAGE_REGISTRY_VALUENAME. The language won't be save in the redistery and the page will be allaws shown.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Yes, when I remove UMUI_LANGUAGE_REGISTRY_VALUENAME, then the multilanguage page will always be shown. But also the language won't be saved, so the previously selected language won't be selected by default. That wouldn't be a real problem, if I could use a multilanguage page in the Uninstaller. But currently I can't! Switching langauge via multilanguage page in an Uninstaller makes the installer abort with error message. Any chance for a fix?</p>

        </blockquote>That's exactly what I though.<br>
        <br>
        The problem is: The original uninstaller only passes the install directory to the temporary uninstaller (e.g. Au_.exe _?=C:\Program Files (x86)\MPlayer for Windows\), <font color="darkred"><i>not</i></font> the path to the original uninstaller (e.g. Au_.exe _?=C:\Program Files (x86)\MPlayer for Windows\Uninstall.exe). I have no idea how to find out the EXE filename without passing it to the temporary installer too. But that would require re-writing parts of NSIS itself, I guess...<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [EDIT]<br>
        <br>
        Maybe you can extract the "_?=" option from Au_.exe's commandline somehow and then directly restart the Au_.exe by passing the correct value of "_?=" plus the "/L" option...

          <p class="post-content">That was fast! Works fine :)<br>
          <br>
          One suggestion though:<br>
          Change "UMUI_DISABLED_BUTTON_TEXT_COLOR" to "707070" for the "gray" Skin. You really can't distinguish disabled buttons from enabled ones otherwise...<br>
          <br>
          Thanks for your work :up:</p>

          <p class="post-content">Hi SuperPat,<br>
          After switching to MUI2 and the new nsdialog code, I have to tell you, I REALLY think you should convert to using nsdialogs instead of using InstallOptions.<br>
          nsdialogs has a lot of our outstanding problems with InstallOptions and UMUI fixed.<br>
          I suspect most of the pending "bugs" you have in UMUI will go away if you convert to nsdialogs...</p>

          <p class="post-content">Depending on the missing Buttons:<br>
          <br>
          I had the same on my XP when i used a NSI file that was before based on XPUI. Exactly the same "non-showing" buttons. Then i re-build the .nsi from scratch based on the UMUI Basic.nsi and than it works perfectly. I didn't compare the two therefore i don't know what it was.<br>
          <br>
          Another question: does anyone know where i can find or get the WANSIS source code that runs after compilation with VS 2005? I'm no C++ guy so i opend the VS2003 based sourcecode in VS2005, let 2005 convert, included all the SDK stuff, compiled without error but didn't run. Shows up an error in the example.nsi in .onGuInit and only tells me: wansis error: c:\......\temp\..\winamp_gen.bmp. No idea why.</p>

          </blockquote>I do <i>not</i> use XPStyle, but still I get reports that Buttons are not drawn. I could not reproduce that problem on my own machines so far, but I do not have a Vista machine here. Also I got reports that the installer crashes in NSISArray.dll when "Custom" setup is selected. Since I do not call NSISArray.dll explicitly anywhere in my installer, it must be some problem caused by UMUI. But again I cannot reproduce the problem. I only got a bugreport from a user...<br>

          <br>
          Since I don't use NSISArray in my own code, it must be something in UMUI's "internal" code or a bug in NSISArray itself. I don't know. But the crash either occurs when leaving the "directory" page or when creating/showing the "startmenu" page. Any ideas on what could be the problem?<br>

          <p class="post-content">Well, maybe the array simply overflows for some reason. That might be: Too many items (folders or shortcuts) in the startmenu directory or very long filenames.

            <br>
            But maybe it would be safer to disable skinned buttons for <i>all</i> versions of Vista x64 that are equal or newer than SP-1, since we must expect that future Service Packs will have the same problem, unless the opposite is proven...<br>
            <br>
            IMHO skinned buttons could be disabled completely for Vista, since I don't care about Vista as long as I don't get any error reports ;)

            I would like to bring to your attention a bug that I am experiencing. With your latest version of UltraModernUI, if a MessageBox is displayed in a custom leave function via MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_LEAVE, some of the buttons on the following screen will not be skinned. This can be demonstrated by the attached script. I'm not sure what's going on, but I think it's in the SkinnedButton plugin. Is there any way you could look in to this?<br>

            <p class="post-content">I have a couple of problems with password fields from installoptions ini files.<br>
            <br>
            First Problem:<br>
            When a user types in a password field, then hits the backspace key, the carret moves back but the * characters remain. When they then type, the carret moves forward again and the * characters that were there before backspace remain until the user types past the end of them.<br>
            <br>
            Second problem:<br>
            A user types in the field, then holds ctrl and hits home, the text is highlighted as expected, however, no matter what they type, the highlight stays and all the existing * characters remain, then behavior is like the first problem.<br>
            <br>
            In short, the UI for a password field does not operate as expected. It does, however, operate fine when used in a non-UltramodernUI interface. Any help here would be appreciated.</p>

            <p class="post-content">I've just switched to using UltraModern UI, mainly because I want to produce a custom look and UMUI seems to handle skinning+ResHacker very well.<br>
            <br>
            I do have one small problem, which I've brought upon myself. I've used ResHacker to move around the components in Dialog 105. And I mean I've moved EVERYTHING around, especially the Header text blocks, which I've shifted down to be right above the big work area. I've also resized the dialog. Generally speaking, it works.<br>
            <br>
            My install script is just a test version of "basic.nsi" that comes with UMUI. I've turned on the Welcome and Finish pages, but not customized them. When I run the installer, everything is great until I get to the Install page. Right before it switches to the Finish page, for a split second, the header text gets what looks like "Installation Complete" written on top of it, such that they both appear at the same time. Then it switches to the Finish page.<br>
            <br>
            It happens so quickly that I can't do a screen capture. Blink and you miss it.<br>
            <br>
            When I switch back to an unhacked UMUI, I don't get the problem, leading me to think that I've moved something -- or perhaps *failed* to move something -- so that the original header text isn't being blanked out.<br>
            <br>
            Another clue: If I don't have a Finish page, the behavior still happens, but the text is replaced with "Installation Complete" and "Setup was completed successfully", which is displayed correctly. There's still a brief flash of overwritten text.<br>
            <br>
            I'm guessing most (all?) developers have not experienced this problem, because hacking the UI is thankfully not the norm. :) But I would appreciate any advice anyone may have about fixing this problem.<br>
            <br>
            Thanks in advance for any help or advice!<br>

            <p class="post-content">D'ohh! Instead of giving you my production script -- too many dependencies for you to compile -- I've given you your "basic.nsi" script updated with the new look. It exhibits the same behavior, though it's right before the StartMenu page displays. (Since on my machine that page takes a while to display.)<br>
            <br>
            The complete setup is included in the attached .zip. Let me know if I've left anything important out.<br>

            <p class="post-content">Yopu are right, the text you seen is well:<br>
            "Installation Complete"<br>
            "Setup was completed successfully."<br>
            <br>
            This is normal behavior of MUI. we can see it with UMUI because I have added some instructions at the end of the finish function.<br>

            I will release a new version immediately.</p>

            <p class="post-content">SuperPat, another question while you're poking around in the code... There are currently several bitmaps used in the background of the installer dialog. (The left image, header image, bottom image and center image.) My design doesn't have five images, just one. For my skinning purposes, having so many images makes things harder, because I need to slice up my design into pieces.<br>
            <br>
            If I were to remove four of the image resources and resize the center image to be the full height and width, will that harm anything. Does the interface get messed up if an expected resource is missing? (I believe I already eliminated the left image, and it seems to work, but maybe I am pushing my luck. :) )<br>
            <br>
            Also, I just noticed the UMUI_CUSTOM_SKIN define, which makes my skinning better, since I need to keep my skin files separate from the normal NSIS code. I can see you really put a lot of thought into this!<br>
            <br>

            <p class="post-content">The UNIQUEBGIMAGE setting does the trick very nicely! (And its companion setting, UNUNIQUEBGIMAGE.) Thanks for that. I'm really happy to discover how easy it is to create a customized installer using UltramodernUI.<br>

            <br>
            There's a minor "bug" in UMUI when its behavior is compared to MUI. In the alternate Start Menu page (using UMUI_PAGE_ALTERNATIVESTARTMENU) if you delete the default choice in the text box you are still allowed to click Next. In MUI, the Next button is disabled if the text box is empty.<br>
            <br>
            The current behavior isn't too bad, but I must admit I prefer the way MUI works in this one case. What would be best, actually, is if this behavior could be controlled by a !define.<br>

              Hi,<br>
              <br>
              I found out about UltraModern today and IÂ´d like to ask if what I think is right. On the download page (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=146999&amp;package_id=161955&amp;release_id=608330" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showf...ease_id=608330</a>), the list shows :<br>
              <br>
              NSIS{version}*<br>
              Ultra*<br>
              <br>
              The NSIS* installers will install NSIS{version} together with UltraModern and Ultra* need NSIS{version} installed. Now as of today UltraModernUI_1.00_2009-02-06.exe is the latest version. I already have NSIS 2.43 and when I luanch the installer it finds it all right. Before I go on and install UltraModern, I would like to know if it can break my current NSIS install. IÂ´m playing with MUI and MUI2 and I want to make sure adding UltraModern to the mix wonÂ´t make my working environment go berserk. Please confirm the Ultra* exe only adds files to the current NSIS install and wonÂ´t affect itÂ´s behaviour.<br>
              <br>
              TIA,<br>

              <br>
              I keep my (NS)Dialogs in seperate files for better overwiew and sharing between different setups, i map the file in like this<br>
              <br>
              !include "..\..\Shared Resources\NSIS Script\Dialog_GetLicenseFile.nsh"<br>
              <br>
              when i do that with Umui i get this error:<br>
              <br>
              <i>Error: no branding image found in chosen UI! Error in macro MUI_HEADER_TEXT on macroline 9 !include: error in script: "..\..\Shared Resources\NSIS Script\Dialog_GetLicenseFile.nsh" on line 50 Error in script "LCM_Setup_Unicode2.nsi" on line 54 -- aborting creation process</i><br>
              <br>
              When i copy the dialog out of the seperate file into the main setup.nsi the error goes away and it works just fine, there is a grey background (instead of the chosen green one) in that dialog but i guess i that can be adjusted somehow.<br>
              <br>

              Just want to let you and others to know that when you run the UMUI installer on Vista 64-bit, the buttons first show up, but immediately gets painted over, resulting in white spaces. Per your post I disabled the skin controls and was able to get the buttons to display correctly. I guess the default skin is in a different location for 64-bit Windoze.</p>

              <p class="post-content">am fed up of seeing people complaining about the missing buttons (which aren't depending on the colour scheme and how well your monitor is setup - they are just grey blobs by default which makes them visible ;) ) so i've had a quick look at the plugin (which someone should have done ages ago rather than keep posting 'me too' replies) which does the skinning and it's due to an attempt in the code to not mis-handle link style controls from the InstallOptionsEx plugin.<br>
              <br>
              the attached version (includes updated SkinnedControls plugin and UMUI.nsh to replace your existing ones) i hope will rectify this and seems to work ok with the example files i threw at it (mainly IOEx based ones and the script for UltraModernUI). if it is ok then i'll clean up my changes to the source code for SuperPat to put into the distro, etc.<br>

              <p class="post-content">Thanks a lot, DrO :cool:<br>
              <br>
              I tried your fixed version of SkinnedControls and it seems to work much better. All the "standard" buttons (Next, Back, Cancel, etc) are visible and skinned now! Unfortunately the "Show Details" button on the install page is still missing. This is on Windows 7, RC-1, 64-Bit. Hope the remaining problem can be fixed too.<br>
              <br>
              [EDIT]<br>
              <br>
              The "Show Details" button is now missing on Windows XP too, so the fix broke something :confused:</p>

              <p class="post-content">hmm, ok. wasn't aware of the UMUI installers showing that button in the first place but then again with the button style checks i'm having to do it's not that much of a surprise. what script are you using or is there a test script that shows the issue (just need something as i'm far too rusty on my nsis coding to remember what's needed to have that button show).<br>
              <br>
              also at the moment i'm only working on a Vista x64 install but that should give the same results as Win7 i'd have hoped.<br>

              <br>
              i've been compiling them in release mode with VS2003 and changed it to not use the Win98 loading optimisation (just a habit from the other projects i work on). also the Skinned Controls one was not set to remove unused sections / comdat stuff (whereas IOex was set to do so).<br>
              <br>
              i'll have the altered source files uploaded probably later tonight but will leave you to alter the project files as needed (makes more sense if you're building with VS2005 rather than mess things up with the files i've got adjusted to load in VS2003).<br>

              <p class="post-content">I noticed a serious problem with UMUI and the UAC plugin: The UAC plugin will create two processes. The "outer" process is running with user privileges, the "inner" one with elevated rights. The "inner" process is the actual installer, but whenever it needs to do something as the normal user (e.g. launch an application that we don't want elevated) it will ask to the "outer" process to do that. So far this works fine and fixed my problems.<br>
              <br>
              Now the UMUI problem: When UMUI changes the language, it will re-start the installer. When using UAC this means: The "inner" process will terminate (and re-start), the "outer" process will terminate after the "inner" has terminated. Now only the "inner" process (the new instance created by UMUI after language switch) is running, but the "outer" process is missing. Consequently all actions that needed the "outer" process will fail (do nothing in fact).<br>
              <br>
              How can I workaround that problem? Thanks in advance :)</p>

                </blockquote>When using the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in" target="_blank">UAC Plugin</a> <font color="darkred"><i>only</i></font> the "inner" process is elevated. The "outer" process runs with <i>RequestExecutionLevel user</i>. This way the "inner" process, while being elevated, can ask the "outer" one to run jobs at <i>user</i> level. This is required, because once a process is elevated, all processes it creates are elevated too. But this causes serious problems. If you launch a normal application with elevated rights, then Drag&amp;Drop will be disabled. And other strange things happen! So we need to be able to launch Non-elevated processes from an elevated installer. That's why the UAC Plugin is so important: It allows to run the "main" (inner) installer at elevated level and do the install tasks, but we can still launch <i>user</i> processes from the "outer" process.<br>
                <br>
                Now the problem with UMUI is that it restarts the installer, when the language is changed. When using UAC Plugin, only the "inner" installer will be restarted. The "outer" one will simply terminate! Because the "outer" one was waiting for the "inner" one and the "inner" one has terminated, so the "outer" one does too. It can't know that the "inner" one created a child process, just before it terminated. Well, that's the usual ExecWait behavior. As a result only the "inner" (elevated) installer will be running after language change in UMUI. All calls that would involve the "outer" installer, such as UAC::Exec will fail! That's a serious problem and it means we can't use UMUI with UAC right now.<br>

                <br>
                For example, in your onInit function you can set the flag:<br>
                <br>
                !insertmacro UMUI_SET_INSTALLFLAG ${UMUI_UPDATE}<br>

                - Updated: NSISArray plugin to version 2.4 that using the new API version. The old version 2.2 of the DLL plugin, using the old API, is kept for user having NSIS versions prior to 2.42.<br>
                - Modified: UMUI installers now install the new API version of the InstallOptionsEx plugin instead of the legacy version for user having NSIS versions 2.42 or later.<br>
                - Added: Configuration define in the Include\UMUI.nsh and Include\MUIEx.nsh files to choose if UMUI need to use the old API version.<br>
                - Fixed: Missing installing two files (exdll-vs2008.sln, exdll-vs2008.vcproj in examples\plugin directory) in the NSIS+UMUI package.<br>
                - Fixed: Warning in the confirm page if UMUI_CONFIRMPAGE_TEXTBOX is not defined.<br>
                - Added: The information page now support natively multiple translated information files. See the Information.nsi example for details.<br>
                - Fixed: The last two characters of the last line of text files where dropped in information pages.<br>
                - Optimization: UMUI use the $EXEPATH variable instead of the System plugin to find the installer full path. Consequently, UMUI is now compatible with NSIS 2.26 at least.<br>

                <p class="post-content">Hi SuperPat,<br>
                <br>
                I'm trying to use the UMUI for a MultiLanguage installer. What I found is that if I try to add Russian in my installer all I get is garbage in the interface. I tried compiling using unicode-NSIS but this seems to break the SkinnedControls plugin (I get an error with a message in Chinese and I get no language selection box). I also tried with the example provided but I have the same problem.<br>
                <br>
                I reckon I have two options here:<br>
                1) Do not show Russian if the codepage is not compatible<br>
                2) Make SkinnedControls work with Unicode<br>
                <br>
                Do you have an idea on both those solutions and what would be the correct way to proceed?<br>
                <br>
                Thanks!</p>

                <p class="post-content">HI there,<br>
                <br>
                Sorry I had to read the TODO list before posting... Anyway, I went the hard way (not that hard once you know what to do but I'm pretty noob in C++) and recompiled the SkinnedControls plugin. I have attached the source code and the compiled dll (it is in the plugins folder) for anyone wanting to give it a shot.<br>
                <br>
                The problem I have now is that the UI_PAGE_MULTILANGUAGE is not appearing, probably because I am using InstallOptionsEx which again is not Unicode. I'll see what I can do with it (I'm afraid I don't have the source code tho) or maybe switch to InstallOptions and get rid of the TreeView view in the StartMenu page.<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, enjoy the Unicode SkinnedControls (provided "as-is" with no warranty etc. etc.)</p>

                  <p class="post-content">Well, NSIS Array is Unicode and using InstallOptions unicode also works. I'm almost getting there except for one thing, the Russian name of the language instead of being "Русский" is all "???????" and also the Welcome page/start menu page and Finish page is all ????? while other pages and buttons work fine...

                  <p class="post-content">OK!<br>
                  <br>
                  For whoever is interested I managed to fix this as well. The solution is to convert all the INI files present in $NSISDIR\Contrib\******odernUI\Ini\ to UTF-16LE (You can do this with Notepad++). That way, WriteIniStr can detect the encoding and write a proper string that can appear no problem.<br>
                  <br>
                  To recap, to get UMUI working with Unicode:<br>
                  1) Get the SkinnedControls.dll compiled for Unicode (posted a couple of posts above)<br>
                  2) Get the NSISArray.dll comiled for Unicode (thanks to afrowuk: <a href="http://www.afrowuk.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.afrowuk.co.uk/</a>)<br>
                  3) DO NOT define UMUI_USE_INSTALLOPTIONSEX (At least until we get InstallOptionsEx compiled for Unicode, will work on that as well!). That means you can't use the TreeVIew in the AlternativeStartMenu page.<br>
                  4) Convert all the INI files from UMUI from ANSI to UTF-16LE<br>
                  <br>
                  I have tested this only on my Win7 machine so as usual anything can break on any other PC but at least now it's working fine.</p>

                  <br>
                  Well, partially. But anyway here is the InstallOptionsEx plugin working in Unicode. The RichText fields are not working because the creation function was too complex and I really had no time to go over it (and the various fread, fopen and fseek).<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway it works for my installer and with the UMUI interface... probably still need to solve a problem with the treeview StartMenu page but for the time being everything else works.<br>
                  <br>
                  Hope you enjoy it!<br>

                  Also the last obstacle with the Treeview StartMenu page has been overcome. It needed replacing the FileRead and FileWrite functions with the corresponding FileReadUTF16LE and FileWriteUTF16LE in Unicode NSIS.<br>
                  <br>
                  Feel free to download the amended .nsh file (zipped) and please let me know any problems you may find. I don't know how much time I'll have to support this but I'll do my best.<br>

                    HI there,<br>
                    <br>
                    Sorry I had to read the TODO list before posting... Anyway, I went the hard way (not that hard once you know what to do but I'm pretty noob in C++) and recompiled the SkinnedControls plugin. I have attached the source code and the compiled dll (it is in the plugins folder) for anyone wanting to give it a shot.<br>
                    <br>
                    The problem I have now is that the UI_PAGE_MULTILANGUAGE is not appearing, probably because I am using InstallOptionsEx which again is not Unicode. I'll see what I can do with it (I'm afraid I don't have the source code tho) or maybe switch to InstallOptions and get rid of the TreeView view in the StartMenu page.<br>
                    <br>
                    Anyway, enjoy the Unicode SkinnedControls (provided "as-is" with no warranty etc. etc.)
                  </blockquote>I made wiki page for SkinnedControls plugin <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/SkinnedControls_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/SkinnedControls_plug-in</a>, if you change something in the code, please mentioned it there too.

                  <p class="post-content">I already read the thread, but still am confused:<br>
                  When using "XpStyle on" - the Show Details button is not showing. Should this be fixed with a current snapshot from sourceforge or is this still a known issue? Any way of getting around it other than turning XpStyle off?<br>
                  <br>
                  Thanks for an awesome UMUI!</p>

                  <p class="post-content">I have been using this UI a lot.<br>
