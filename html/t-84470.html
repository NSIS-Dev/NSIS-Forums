I thank all people who supported me in achieving this goal. First of all of course all people of the NSIS Forum. Furthermore, I'd like to thanks my parents, the neighbours, my goldfish and of course my computer for not crashing too much lately.<br><br>My plans for the future are just to try to answer as many questions as possible to help all of you out. I do not expect huge problems since you all have behaved real nice as long as I can remember.<br><br>So just continue your work with NSIS as I will do. Please always first try to search the Forum, because your question could already have been answered. If not, just post the question and the answer will soon be posted. Furthermore, I really support the idea of the "READ ME FIRST" to tell the people who where so kind to answer to your problem if the solution worked.<br><br>I think that's it.<br>But the most important part: just have fun!!!<br><br>Good luck everyone with NSIS,<br>greetz from Holland,<br><br>-Hendri.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">SQwerl</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th April 2002 09:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">lol<br>/me applauds<br>---<br>And as for us to behave (i'm agreeing with you Smile2Me).
