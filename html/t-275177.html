      <p class="post-content"><strong>LangDLL, NSIS:Language and /S switch</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I had in my script support for multiple languages. Later on, my company decided that for now we support english only. Because I know for a fact that this will get change to support multi-language again, I left the language-code into the script, and I just commented out the following lines:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />;!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "French"<br />...<br />Function .onInit<br />;!insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />...<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Everything seems to work fine, english is by default used in the installer and uninstaller, no language dialog is shown. But there is one problem: if I install silently (my-setup.exe /S) the "NSIS:Language" entry is NOT written in the registry, which means that when I later uninstall the program from Add/Remove programs, I get the choose-language-dialog, which is not desired. (The "NSIS:Language" is written into the registry if the installer is run non-silent)<br />
      <br />
      Questions:<br />
      a) Why in a silent install the NSIS:Language is not written into the registry? Is this by design? I mean, in a non-silent install, even if the language-dialog is not shown, the NSIS:Language is written into the registry with the default value.<br />
      b) How could I solve my problem without removing my language code from the script?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you,<br />

      <p class="post-content">The MUI_LANGDLL_SAVELANGUAGE macro is inserted in the InstFiles page leave function, so you should put !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_SAVELANGUAGE somewhere where it shall be called in a silent install (like a hidden section).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi Stu,<br />
      <br />
      Thx for your answer.<br />
      <br />
      a) Are you saying that the language is not saved because the "InstFiles page leave function" is not called in a silent install?<br />
      <br />
      b) I could put the !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_SAVELANGUAGE into the Main section at the end of it, in case of IfSilent, no?<br />
      <br />
      c) btw, is this problem a bug of MUI, or I'm just using it inadequately?<br />
      <br />
      Thx,<br />

      <p class="post-content">It is a common mistake to think that a page leave function is executed in a silent install. Of course, it isn't, because the page itself is never displayed.<br />
      Using IfSilent or ${If} ${Silent} with that in a hidden/unselectable section is the way to go.<br />

      </blockquote>Yes, this is clear. What it's not clear, is: shouldn't this somehow be already supported in MUI? I mean MUI_LANGDLL_SAVELANGUAGE is not even documented, so it shouldn't be the user's job to call it specially in a silent install. So, it's either a MUI bug, or I'm misusing something.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Logically if you install silently, you don't select a language? How can it save a language then?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yes, I agree, but on the other hand no language is selected also when the !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY is commented out, like in my case, and still in that case a language is saved in a non-silent mode.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yes but my point is if you installed silently originally, you would have never selected a language so the uninstaller <i>has</i> to display the dialog.<br />
