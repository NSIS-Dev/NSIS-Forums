      <p class="post-content"><strong>Progress message dialog box 'unpacking data' doesnt show before setup loads</strong><br />
      Hi there,<br />
      <br />
      I have made an installer which is 50 MB compressed and upon execution it show the message box "please wait while setup is loading... Initilizing setup 15 % "<br />
      <br />
      but the main thing is it doesnt show the other progress message box "please wait while setup is loading... unpacking data 20 % "<br />
      <br />
      My installer takes around 20 secs to unpack and doesnt show this mesaage while unpacking. I know it shows this msg as it showed it in my previous versions but not the latest.<br />
      <br />
      20 secs without anything on the screen by the installer makes people think their system has hanged as mouse moves slowly too due to high CPU usage while unpacking.<br />
      <br />
      For some reason I cant get the Splash screen to work too.<br />
      <br />
      heres my .oninit code :<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      why has that gone away?<br />
      <br />
      Is it because of the new version of Nsis 2.02?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It should show. I don't know why it doesn't show anymore, I'll check it out.<br />
      <br />
      In any case, you really should use ReserveFile so your setup will load faster.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The only part effecting the unpacking data msg box would be in the .oninit function right?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yes, .onInit should be the only function that affects the showing of that dialog. NSIS 2.0 can be downloaded from the project page:<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, I have looked at it and found out that everything works as should. When using solid compression, the dialog will show. Solid compression is enabled by default for bzip2 and lzma.<br />
      <br />
      The problem with your script is that you extract very large files in .onInit. That's a bad idea. If you're doing that, you should at least use the Banner plug-in to show a message to the user.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The banner plug in replaces this dialog, but I think as this dialog isnt being shown, it wont show the banner too.<br />
      <br />
      I would still like to have the orignal dialog over the banner as it shows the progress.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way I can get the dialog back?<br />
      <br />
      and you said having the files unpack at .oninit is a bad idea. Is there a way to change that? like can I have it unpack the selected components only at the install page?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It will show the banner, if you use it.<br />
      <br />
      You can use solid compression (SetCompressor bzip2 or SetCompressor lzma) to get back the dialog.<br />
      <br />
      To unpack the files only in the install page, unpack them in a section. Each visible section is a component in the components page, and only the selected components will execute the code in their sections.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Use the File command in the sections to have it unpack the files in the sections. For example:</p>

      <br />
      But how do I get the splash screen to show up?<br />

      <p class="post-content">MakeNSISw has an option to override the compression. It is also possible you've downloaded the special build with solid compression disabled. To make sure you haven't, run makensis with the /HDRINFO switch and look for NSIS_BZIP2_COMPRESS_WHOLE. If it's there, you don't have the special build.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It turns out the "unpacking" progress dialog didn't show because of the usage of BGGradient. This happens because the unpacking dialog won't show if the NSIS dialog was already created. The gradient background window pretends to be the dialog for so it can be used as the parent of splash screens. Since it is created before .onInit, anything extract in .onInit won't have the "unpacking" dialog.<br />
      <br />
      I have made the gradient background window stop pretending to be the dialog window. The background window is hidden while processing .onInit anyway so the script can make the installer silent without the window flashing.</p>
