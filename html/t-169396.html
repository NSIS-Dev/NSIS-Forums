      <p class="post-content"><strong>using NSISdl to get a list of files to download</strong><br />
      HI<br />
      I am building an auto-update engine for my software in NSIS. Is it possible to download a list of files to download using NSISdl , and then download and replace those files one by one? I have searched the forums and the archive, and have not found a way to do this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm afraid I don't understand what your saying. If you could point me to an example script, please do so. I need a way to download a list of files, open that list, and then download the files in that list one by one.<br />
      <br />
      I would just download the main EXE, but what if I want to add more new stuff than the main EXE? What if a new feature I added requires a new dll or something?<br />
      <br />
      The only thing I can think of is to download and run an installer. But I'd rather be able to download a list of files, like I said at the top of this post.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was thinking more along the lines of "download a nsis script, and then run the instructions in the script". Is this possible?</p>

      <p class="post-content">because I might want to register a new dll or something, and it might not all be going in the same folder, etc. etc.<br />
      <br />
      I think the way to go on this one is to download an installer, and run the downloaded installer. Only thing is the downloaded installer might want to replace the updater. Is there a way to get the installer to copy itself to a temp folder before running itself, in the same way that the uninstaller does?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sure. For an example see the NSIS Update script (available in CVS, Contrib\NSIS Update).</p>
