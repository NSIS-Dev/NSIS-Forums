      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to create a service EXE which calls a BATCH file.</strong><br />
      I went to <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Service_Lib" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Service_Lib</a> and included "servicelib.nsh".<br />
      I have a batch (.BAT) file which I wanted to add as a Windows Service.<br />
      I have written an EXE, Its code is given below:<br />
      <br />
      outfile "Gateway-Start.exe"<br />
      <br />
      !include servicelib.nsh<br />
      !define InstallDir "Gateway"<br />
      InstallDir "$PROGRAMFILES\${InstallDir}"<br />
      <br />
      # create a default section.<br />
      section<br />
      call executeGateway<br />
      setOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
      sectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      Function executeGateway<br />
      # I tried using EXEC but no success.<br />
      # Exec "$INSTDIR\bin\gateway.start.bat";<br />
      ExecShell "open" "$INSTDIR\bin\gateway.start.bat";<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      If I double click above EXE the gateway BATCH files starts, but if I add this EXE as a Windows Service the BATCH file executes but the status in services.msc never changes to STARTED.<br />
      <br />
      Its very urgent please help and thanks in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe it's because the exe closed itself after the batch is started and the batch is closing as well after the eof is reached?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to create a service EXE which calls a BATCH file.</strong><br />
      The BATCH file executes successfuly as I do see java.exe instance alive in Task Manager.<br />
      <br />
      But NSIS EXE gets closed after I receive a PopUp saying "Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in timely fashion" in my services.msc window.<br />
      <br />
      Even if the NSIS EXE gets closed the java.exe (the BATCH file) still persist in Task Manager which is correct.<br />
      <br />
      The problem is, in services.msc the status for my service is not saying STARTED, it just says STARTING... and then no status.<br />
      <br />
      Please help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Erm... it's java that is running and not the batch.<br />
      Windows is only watching the file, the service is associated to (like service.exe).<br />
      <br />
      if the service is the batch file itself, try starting java with "Start /W". This will keep the batch running until java is closed.<br />
      Maybe the msc will then tell the correc status, but i can't say this for sure because i never build a service on a batch.<br />
      But i did serveral times using VB.<br />
      <br />
      Using VB makes own serices easy because i can watch the started process (like java) and if it was closed, stop the service or restart the program. Maybe this is an option for you?<br />
      You can use NSiS for such a program too, but in my opinion it's harder with NSiS to get the pid of a specific process.<br />
      <br />
      Edit:<br />
      Forgot to mention that the service exe, which starts the program, is made to stay in memory. Won't work else.</p>
