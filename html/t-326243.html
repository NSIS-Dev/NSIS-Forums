      <p class="post-content">Okay i am very new to this and i do not think that the manual is beginner friendly so i am sorry for all the questions!<br>
      <br>
      I have made this code now:<br>
      <br>
      !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_Html_PRE<br>
      <br>
      Function Html_Pre<br>
      <br>

      ReadRegStr $0 HKLM SOFTWARE\Lotusnotes\Domino\1 DataPath<br>

      ${AndIf} $0 != setOutPath $DESKTOP<br>

      <br>
      ${EndIf}<br>
      <br>
      FunctionEnd<br>
      <br>
      Should this work? I get this error if i try run it;<br>
      <br>
      !define: "MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_Html_PRE"=""<br>
      Function: "Html_Pre"<br>

      ReadRegStr $0 HKLM\SOFTWARE\Lotusnotes\Domino\1\DataPath<br>
      Invalid command: ${IfNot}<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I think i get that if there is an error it's running the code i place here: ${AndIf} $0 != ``<br>
      <br>
      But if i need a browser to show up, so they can give that path themselves, is that something u might know?</p>

      <br>
      I did not use the Modern UI, but have now rewritting my code and are using it now, and damn that is just a lot easier and much more stylish!<br>
      <br>
      I been looking at finding some way so slow down the installation, maybe some disc space check and sleeptimer, but i have not been able to find the code to the Modern UI, i do not now if there maybe is a site with more different codes then on the Modern UI page?<br>

      Okay then this is my code now.<br>
      <br>
      But i don't think it work like it maybe should! :) The main thing is that at the $0\domino\html, the html dir can in some of my cases have been moved it happens rarely but i need an error, or if it is possible a way to extract that specific "html" folder on a browsed location, and only that folder(Its a installer for some of our users and they should be able to do it by themselves) ! But when i try and test it, and move the html dir so it is not in that path, it just creates the folder and move the files in there, i hope you can follow me!<br>

      Likes this right? If i remove the html folder the .exe just creates the folder at the location from the registry, and that is what is should not do, i need an error or and browser were you can manually place the files. Is that possible?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The only thing wrong with that code is you probably want to add StrCpy $DataPath $DataPath\domino\html just before the Abort. You keep saying you need a 'browser' for manual directory selection which is exactly what the Directory page is for. Do you never see the directory page? Also make sure you use $DataPath in your install sections. If you're reading from the registry key again on install then that is defeating the purpose of having $DataPath store the result of the directory page.<br>

      <p class="post-content">I know that i can get a directory page to show, but the main thing with this installer is that the users i am creating this installer to, are in hopefully all cases having the directories in the path i am getting from the registry, but it is possible to move the "html" dir, as said before in that case i need the html dir to be manually installed, but i have talked with some from my work and they say that it is most rarely and some have never seen it being moved, so that is not a priority anymore.<br>
      <br>
      Now my boss has asked if it is possible to get a page that shows the directory in which the installer gets from the registry, in this case C:\Lotus\Domino\Data for example.<br>
      <br>
      I have tried to add the directory page, and get the ReadRegStr $0 HKLM "SOFTWARE\Lotus\Domino\1" "DataPath" - to be shown and grayed out in best case so they cant change it, and i need it to be the path from the directory because it can be placed on different drives depending on the user, but i can't get it to work.<br>
      Then i tough a customized page, but that seems pretty difficult to make, .ini file, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      I don't know if you got something that could help me here. I am really great full for all the help i have gotten from you at this point!<br>
