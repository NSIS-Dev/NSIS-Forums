      <p class="post-content"><strong>request admin privileges + run upon finish</strong><br />
      when running the installed program upon finish in combination with requesting application privileges as admin:<br />
      - if a "user" is trying to install, he/she must choose one of the "admin" user accounts to be able to install.<br />
      - the password for this admin user must be filled in to allow the install procedure.<br />
      - upon finishing the installation the installed program is started:<br />
      this process is actually started as the admin user, but running on the logged on user's desktop!<br />
      if the application has any kind of file dialogs (open, save as, etc.) this "user" is now able to browse, alter, delete, all of this admin user's files!<br />
      <br />
      this "bug" or what to call it, is fairly common among many installers, but it would be nice to be able to avoid it.<br />
      <br />
      is there any workaround? that is; let the installer start the program upon finish, but as the user logged on, not as the admin running the installation?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Two solutions exist for NSIS:<br />
      1) Remove the Run Application checkbox from your finish page. This is the simple solution.<br />
      2) Use the UAC plugin to execute your application As User in a finishpage run-function. This is the complicated solution, and sports a much higher chance of going wrong.<br />
      <br />
      Option 1 is recommended. The Run checkbox is practically useless anyway.</p>
