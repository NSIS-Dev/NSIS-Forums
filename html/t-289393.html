We had one member writing a like installer, but work has gotten him very busy.<br><br>What we have are maps with thumbnail DDS files (which can be converted to any other type for this) which we want the program to be able to use like a slide show, and when the user finds the map they want, they click a button and the program first removes one or two files from a previous map, opens a ZIP file and copies the one or two files from there into a folder in the games UserMaps folder, then drops to the desktop.<br><br>I've been told it can be done, and with a example Installer I've written an Installer for one of my maps, but I'm really lost as to the hows of the programming.<br><br>Would anyone be able and willing to tackle this?<br><br>I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this, and would understand if it was pulled.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st March 2008 21:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Can be done...it'll be the best to make a plugin just for this task...or trying using nsDialogs.<br>I think the real task will be the slideshow, I have the code in my head, but not in the correct environment.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">snoopy55</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st March 2008 21:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">It would be MUCH appreciated!<br><br>The files for the slide show can be placed anywhere.
