<code><br>OptionsReset ON|OFF <br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      OptionsReset ON will make the options jump back to the developer configured defaults if the user selects back.<br>
      <br>
      OptionsReset OFF will let the user-selected options stay if the user backs up to check what they did.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hrm. It really ought to remember user settings by default. I'll see what I can do about that.<br>
      <br>
      If the user enters a change and hits the Next button, I can't imagine why it should ever reset to the developer's settings. I don't think that such an option is necessary.<br></p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks guys ...<br>
      <br>
      I'd just like to say that effort on this installer is fantastic.<br>
      <br>
      I downloaded nsis143.exe to build an installer for use in our company, finished it in 2 hrs, and started the documentation for it in the pm.<br>
      <br>
      When I checked out the web site to ensure the URLs were right in the afternoon, a new version had appeared ...<br>
      <br>
      I suppose I prefixed the question with newbie as I'd got less than 8hrs experience with it, and thought it was a silly question.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, thanks for your input, hard work and help.<br>
      <br>
      regards<br>
      <br>

      <p class="post-content">I fixed this problem in my non-official version, 1.44e... I'll do a binary-only release this afternoon, and a full source release ASAP.<br>
      <br>
      Kudos to Justin for creating such a wonderful installer and open-sourcing the code :)</p>
