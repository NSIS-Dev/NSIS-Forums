      <p class="post-content"><strong>Distributing NSIS with my app</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I want to distribute NSIS with my shareware application and I wanted to ensure that legally its fine - which I think it is.<br />
      <br />
      Also I have successfully embedded the NSIS installer into my own install (generated with NSIS of course). However it means that NSIS typically pops up its' window after it's installer has run from the users point of view.<br />
      <br />
      I am assuming if I modify the makensis.nsi in the examples directory I can create an NSIS installer without the NSIS program running at the end? I'm not quite sure where it does this.<br />
      <br />
      Also if I use the makensis example to create nsis's installer it says annonymous all over it and who knows what other stuff. What do I need to do?<br />
      <br />
      I have also thought about including a strip down version of NSIS in my apps own directory that it would privately use. But I don't know what I would need to do for this and which files are needed (I use MUI) - maybe problems with a NSIS registry setting, especially if someone installed a full copy of NSIS etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There's no need to modify makensis.nsi. You should create a new script that installs just what you need without any user intervention. Registry is not an issue. Strip down whatever you can't compile your scripts without.</p>
