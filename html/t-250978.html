      <p class="post-content"><strong>how to install to steam/counter-strike path</strong><br />
      hi.. I have a custom server with some files i need to install in counter-strike folder for steam.<br />
      The problem is that all steam users have their own path for steam..<br />
      I mean every path changes because of the username or hard drive, like mine "D:\Steam\SteamApps\sidico\counter-strike", but almost every one have it in "C:\Program files\Steam\SteamApps\@user\counter-strike"<br />
      <br />
      how can I set "InstallDir" to get the correct path for the folder "counter-strike", no matter wich drive is it or the most important thing "the username".. I have no idea :(<br />
      <br />
      thanx a lot..</p>

      it helped me a lot, now my installer works like I wanted, it install everywhere steam is..<br />
      <br />
      I tryed to make another installer for my dedicated server, the problem is that I have to install it in another path, in my PC at home is in "C:\program files\valve", but in my college is in "E:\custom server\valve".. I tryed to modify the code but it doesn't compile.. I'm so noob at this, can u help me with a code like yours but this time it just have to look for the folder "valve"<br />
      <br />
      I really wanted to do it myself, but I can´t..<br />
      Sorry if I´m asking too much.. sorry for my english too..<br />
      <br />
      thank you..</p>

      <p class="post-content">The function should still work, because it gets the path from the registry. It does not search the computer for a "Valve" folder. This would be very unprofessional.<br />
      <br />
      Is "E:\custom server\valve" a proper Steam installation?<br />

      <p class="post-content">sorry I forgot to mention, valve forlder is for counter strike 1.5 that is still popular in my country<br />
      I think 1.5 has to be with WON or something, It doesn´t come with steam :(<br />
      <br />
      Edit: I think it has to look for hl.exe because you can change the name of valve folder too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If it isn't a Steam program then it will likely have a registry entry somewhere else for the location that it is installed in. Use the search feature in regedit and do a search for the folder path.<br />

      <p class="post-content">thanx.. I have the path, the problem is i dunno how to use it to install there.. for exmaple:<br />
      I have HKCU "Software\Lala" "Lala"<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Function path<br /> ReadRegStr $La HKCU "Software\Lala" "Lala"<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>

      <p class="post-content">No problem :)<br />
      <br />
      For a default install path, use InstallDir "my path".<br />
      If that registry key exists however, it will use the path in the registry instead.<br />
