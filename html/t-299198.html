I do not know how to setup such things, but it seems to be some kind of mounting several disks to create such a directory structure. But this is not the subject of this thread. Obviously this seems to be possible with this OS.<br><br>W: &lt;first disk - old harddisk with capacity of 13MB&gt;<br>W:\GSI$GSIRoot &lt;second disk - lots of GB space&gt;<br>W:\GSI$GSIRoot\Application\Setups &lt;third disk - lots of GB space&gt;<br><br>The target directory is:<br>W:\GSI$GSIRoot\Application\Setups\Programs\Other\VDE-Normen\VDE 8.0<br><br>That means it is addresses a folder on the third hdd with lots of space. The MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY however DOES NOT ENABLE the 'NEXT' button and shows a free space of 13MB. Apparently the calculation of space is always using the root of the path - what is working in 99.9 % of all use cases. But here it maps to the 13 MB disk, instead of detecting this uncommon directory mapping to the big harddisk.<br><br>I used MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VERIFYONLEAVE to ship around that and offered an IGNORE button to continue. But until today I thought the builtin MUI page could handle it all.<br><br>Is it possible for NSIS to detect such situations? What about other installers - are those aware of such things? Is anyone familiar with this situation? It would appreciate when the answer to this question will be merged into the NSIS MUI code, thus everybody can create installers that pass such situations as well.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">saschagottfried</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th October 2008 09:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Until now I had no reply.
