Current XP icons, say in the titlebar, 16x16 pixels typically, would be so small as to be almost invisible when the screen resolution is twice that or three times what it is today. It's my understanding that Vista icons are capable of adjusting to the screen resolution. If all interfaces increase in size <i>some day</i>, graphics, and not just icons, need to appear larger. That has implications for images you design today. <i>The request is:</i> if images are made larger and resized to fit (already stretching happens if the bitmap is smaller, or bigger, as you point out), future installer versions would be able to use the same images with a high enough resolution. Admittedly, it's a crackpot idea. You might as well wait until 250/320 DPI displays are in use, then begin to consider if you want to build a new installer with a larger interface with enhanced graphics. Too much trouble for now. Wishful thinking. I shouldn't have brought it up in a NSIS context. The MUI appearance is probably good for another couple of years, maybe longer than that.:up:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2007 21:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I'm sorry, I still don't understand the request.

I don't understand really perhaps, why Vista icons can resize depending on the user's screen res. Having that feature in icons, there is also a case for creating applications that resize. As an example, if you have a 3096x2304 display setting (Bill Gate's utopia apparently), the titlebar and the titlebar icon show up with more pixels. (Is that possible?) You must forgive, I'm a complete idiot when it comes to programming. I don't know the next thing about software development. My only wish is for a smooth transition from the average display resolution today to those higher DPI settings. I don't feel like scrapping my MUI installer when it becomes too small ... in 2011?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd April 2007 09:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">No need to apologize, I'm just trying to figure out what's needed here.

Probably a define named something like MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP_HIGH_DPI will need to be created which will contain the path to the higher DPI image.

Since on XP, not Vista, I don't have much experience with DPI settings: 96 and 120 and custom. I can emulate the effect of stretching in Photoshop. Distortion occurs unless the DPI is exactly 96 or 192 or 288. Larger images aren't the cure. Small fonts tend to look ugly when an image is stretched.

Such images would appear less blurry, I thought, in Windows Vista with improved high DPI device support over XP. In fact, I knew larger images were <i>resized to fit</i> at higher DPI settings. I wasn't requesting the feature. I didn't know increasing DPI expanded the image area. Windows XP at 200% DPI expands the Modern UI welcome/finish page area to 993x603 pixels. The 96 DPI default size is 497x314 pixels. You seem to be suggesting a feature where the image area expands but bitmaps are not stretched? I'm not sure why.<br><br>Q: Vista <i>is</i> more accurate, 994x628 pixels at 200% DPI. ?
