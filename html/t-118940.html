      <p class="post-content"><strong>Listing NSIS Variables</strong><br />
      kichik or anyone - is it possible to have all variables used by NSIS listed cathegorically?<br />
      I used NSIS readme before NSIS 2.0 (because it had tables and I could select all variables (but anyway, I like the current readme better :))<br />
      example list (NSIS 1.9x hightlighter):<br />
      <br />
      OutFile Name Caption SubCaption BrandingText Icon<br />
      <br />
      and so on with one space between.<br />
      Any ideas?<br />
      BTW, I am making highlighter for ConTEXT (<a href="http://www.fixedsys.com/context" target="_blank">www.fixedsys.com/context</a>) for NSIS2, so I ask.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, ConTEXT 1.0 is in works, rewritten from scratch, closed beta will happen soon.

      <p class="post-content">I like EditPlus, it's very customizable and is easy to use. It's not free though. I bought it before I even knew C, not to mention NSIS :D<br />
      <br />
      I have written a syntax file for it and sent it to the author a long time ago. The file he has on his website is very old. I have a newer addition on my computer but it changes so rapidly so I don't send it to him. I will send it when NSIS 2 final is out.<br />
      <br />
      If you took all of the words from NSIS the way I told you to then your syntax file is complete. I told EditPlus to treat your file as a NSIS script and all of the words were in the right place.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I am in a process of making a highlighter for another editor (syn Text editor).<br />
      <br />
      This editor has three grops of words for highlighting (and I need exactly three, but I am not exactly sure how to divide them correctly):<br />
      1. Objects<br />
      2. Constants<br />
      3. Keywords<br />
      <br />
      In my previous NSIS highlighter there were three groups of keywords:<br />
      a) AddBrandingImage AddSize AutoCloseWindow BGGradient (etc.)<br />
      b) Abort BringToFront Call CallInstDLL ClearErrors (etc.)<br />
      c) SW_SHOWNORMAL SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED SW_SHOWMINIMIZED (etc.)<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions of how to put them?</p>

      I think it got changed to "!AddPluginDir", but I am not sure - remove it for now.<br />
