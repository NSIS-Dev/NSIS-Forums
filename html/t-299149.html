      <p class="post-content"><strong>Building NSIS</strong><br />
      I am attempting to compile NSIS. Compiling the first time is always the hardest thing for me when trying to get an open source project setup.<br />
      <br />
      I downloaded and extracted nsis-2.40-src.tar<br />
      <br />
      Via the links on this page:<br />
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Building_NSIS_from_SVN" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Building_NSIS_from_SVN</a><br />
      <br />
      I have installed:<br />
      Platform SDK 2003 R2 with all options checked.<br />
      SCons v1.1 (I forget what the problem was, but the older version gave me errors about it not being a new enough version, so I installed v1.1)<br />
      Python 2.5.1<br />
      <br />
      I already have Visual Studio Team System 2008 SP1 installed with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2008 as one of the components. However, when installing I chose the C# developer profile, so I'm not sure if this would affect the build scripts ability to find what it needs.<br />
      <br />
      I was going to install Visual Studio 2005 Express as well, but all roads on microsoft's website lead to Visual Studio 2008 Express.<br />
      <br />
      This is my command prompt log:<br />
      L:\Development\Code\Nsis\nsis-2.40-src&gt;scons<br />
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...<br />
      Delete("nsis-25-Oct-2008.cvs")<br />
      Delete(".instdist")<br />
      Delete(".test")<br />
      Using Microsoft tools configuration<br />
      *** Couldn't find a good version of libcp.lib<br />
      <br />
      L:\Development\Code\Nsis\nsis-2.40-src&gt;<br />
      <br />
      Any help would be greatly appreciated as usual.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks. That seemed to do the trick. Now it can't find windows.h though. Is the script looking for it based on the include directories configuration in VS C++ Express? Or do I need to add that to the path?<br />
      <br />
      Also, is this the correct version of the windows SDK that it needs?<br />
      "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Include"</p>

      I've used the Windows SDK Configuration tool to set me version to 6.1. I've added ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Include" to the Include paths in Visual Studio 2005.<br />
      <br />
      I've also tried running scons from the the Windows SDK command prompt, the VS 2005 command prompt, and the VS 2008 command prompt.<br />
      <br />
      What is the method scons uses to search for includes?</p>

      </blockquote>Hello,<br />
      I am also trying to compile this sources... But, dont know why, Scons can't be found. So, I dont see this:<br />
      "scons: Reading SConscript files ...".<br />
      Could you write here what did you do to compile it (try to compile)?<br />
      I mean, what programs did you installed (versions), what environments path did you add, etc...<br />
      I am looking for a simple description how to build this sources on Windows (XP) platform. I wanted to translate NSIS to my language (program + docs), but It is impossible without possibility to build it... (have to say, that there was time I did it, with NSIS 2.23 version... and now I cant do it, don't know what am I doiing wrong).<br />
      <br />
      Ps: Kichik, maybe you will find some time to write some simple guide?<br />
      <br />

      It seems my issue might be related to this, but not knowing much about python or scons, I'm not sure how to work around it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Pepe, also, after installing Python and Scons, you have to add them to your PATH environment variables. Somewhere under the Python directory there is a subdirectory with a scons batch file in it. You have to add that path to your "PATH" environment variable.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think I figured out the problem. I installed the "Windows Server 2008" version of the paltform SDK accidentally. The download page for the 2003 version has a "Web Install" link that I clicked and it downloaded the 2008 version, because I didn't read he note next to the link saying it was for 2008 because it "superceded" the 2003. If I had been paying attention I would have seen the correct version was at the bottom of the page.<br />
      <br />
      I'll know for sure if this was it after I get the virtual pc setup.</p>

      </blockquote>Could you write it more detail. What directory?<br />
      What is this path exactly.<br />
      And to run compilation we are going to main folder of NSIS, or NSIS source folder? (to write in console the "Scons" command).<br />

      <p class="post-content">That was the error I was originally getting.<br />
      <br />
      I isntalled the Platofrm SDK for Windows 2003 and C++ 2005 Express, then followed the direction from the link above. Here it is again:<br />
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixG.html" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixG.html</a><br />
      <br />
      The specific steps from that page I followed was to run these three commands:<br />
      set MSSDK=C:\Path\To\Platform SDK<br />
      set VCToolkitInstallDir=C:\Path\To\VCToolkit<br />
      scons MSTOOLKIT=yes<br />
      <br />
      Where C:\Path\To\Platform SDK is something like C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\, you'll have to browse around for it.<br />
      <br />
      <b>I don't know what VCToolkitInstallDir is supposed to be set to. I tried setting it to my VS C++ 2005 isntall directory.</b><br />
      <br />
      I now get the linking errors above. I also tried the parameter to skip all plugins, and it gets alot further, but eventually I get the same link error again.</p>

      <p class="post-content">VCToolkitInstallDir is only for the very old and probably no longer available VC Toolkit. I use it to build the nightly build because it's a standalone version which doesn't require the GUI and runs fine on WINE. For Visual C++ Express, it should just work once you properly install the latest Platform SDK. Missing windows.h means you haven't properly installed and configured Platform SDK.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, you are correct, the Windows.h error was because I was installing the wrong 2008 platform SDK instead of the 2003 version. I've gotten past that, but haven't been able to proceed beyond the error "advsplash.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol ___security_cookie referenced in function _WndProc@16"<br />
      <br />
      I have tried this on a couple different setups on clean WinXP virtual machines.<br />
      <br />
      I will verify this evening, but I think if I don't set VCToolkitInstallDir then I get an error about it not being set. These are the commands I am using:<br />
      <br />
      C:\nsis-2.40-src&gt;set VCToolkitInstallDir=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\.<br />
      <br />
      C:\nsis-2.40-src&gt;set MSSDK=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK<br />
      <br />
      C:\nsis-2.40-src&gt;scons MSTOOLKIT=yes<br />
      <br />
      I have also tried:<br />
      set VCToolkitInstallDir=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\<b>VC</b>\.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: Also I have tried the option to skip compiling plugins, but I still get the same error on a different obj file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Again, VCToolkitInstallDir is only for VC Toolkit and should not be used for Visual C++ Express 2008. Platform SDK 2003 is also very old and you should install the latest to make sure it works best with Visual C++ Express 2008. Once you get SCons to properly recognize you're using 2008 version by not using VCToolkitInstallDir, it'll automatically add /GS- which should disable the security cookie.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks. I was getting the link error using VS C++ 2005(not 2008) with the Windows Server 2003 platform SDK.<br />
      <br />
      I will try 2008 C++ Express with the Windows Server 2008 Platform SDK. I'm not sure if scons supports this yet though, because I saw some others having issues with the 2008 Platform SDK because the directory structure has been changed around.</p>
