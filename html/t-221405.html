      <p class="post-content"><strong>FindProc and MUI</strong><br />
      Is there an issue using FindProcDLL and the MUI?<br />
      <br />
      I have a script that uses FindProc to detect if my application is running before attempting to replace the exe, and it worked fine when I was not using MUI. Now I have switched to use MUI and now the FindProc call always returns 0 even if the exe is running.<br />
      <br />
      FindProcDLL::FindProc "MyApp.exe"<br />
      StrCmp $R0 1 0 +3<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK "Close MyApp and retry this install."<br />
      Quit<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could try the old fashioned way:<br />
      <br />
      FindWindow $R0 "" "MyApp Window Title"<br />
      IsWindow $R0 0 +3<br />
      MessageBox MB_RETRYCANCEL|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "Close MyApp!" IDRETRY -2<br />
      Abort<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the quick reply Stu!<br />
      <br />
      That works fine for now, but in the future the title of the window may change dynamically. Is there a known issue with FindProc that prevents it from being used with MUI? Is there another way I can determine if a process is running by the name of the exe?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The MUI is just an interface and should have no effects on standard script code. Please attach a minimal example that reproduces the problem.<br />
      <br />
      It looks like what you are trying to do can be done in an easy and more reliable way using a mutex.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That is what I assumed, but I can't get FindProc to work correctly when using MUI. Maybe I'm missing something stupid, it wouldn't be the first time.<br />
      <br />
      In this script, I check for iTunes because I am running it, and it skips right thru, as if it doesn't detect it running.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think the title for FindWindow has to be the complete title, just some of it. Also, you can pass it a window handle too (not sure which param it is) but for Internet Explorer it's ieframe (somthing like that).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Muggz, I ran your script checking for notepad.exe (since I don't have itunes) and it ran as expected. Stopped when notepad was running and went on through when notepad wasn't running.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That is odd, it doesn't work for me. Maybe I have an old version of the dll? The last mod date for my dll is 12-25-03</p>
