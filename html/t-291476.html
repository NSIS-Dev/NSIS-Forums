      <p class="post-content"><strong>AccessControl (i cant use it)</strong><br />
      Hi there,<br />
      I'm obviously missing something, i can't get the AccessControl plugin to work.<br />
      <br />
      I'm using Vista, running as an admin user with the UAC turned on.<br />
      <br />
      I'm trying to make a file have generic read and generic write access for all users, or maybe just full acccess.<br />
      <br />
      I've tried the line:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>AccessControl::GrantOnFile "$strMachineIniPath" "(S-1-1-0)" "GenericRead + GenericWrite"</code>
</pre><br />
      But this gives me an error when I compile, am I missing something such as including the dll or something?<br />
      I've copied the AccessControll.dll to the same directory as my install script (nsi and ini's).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      After reading up on how to use a dll I've tried:<br />
      <pre>
<code>System::Call 'AccessControl.dll::GrantOnFile(t ."$strMachineIniPath", t ."(S-1-1-0)", t ."FullAccess")'</code>
</pre><br />
      This compiles but does not seem to do what I wanted.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Also does a return value get pushed? I tried pop $r1, it had "success" in it, was that from this call or left over from a previous function call?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Any help would be greatly appreciated, I've been reading the forums all morning and still dont see what I'm doing wrong.<br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Coolblu77.

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the reply Anders.<br />
      <br />
      I knew it would be something simple like that, I'm sure I read that NSIS looks in the current directory as well as those defined for plugins, but maybe not.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway thats working now.<br />
      <br />
      And I can see that it is returning a response on the stack.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      One other question, I'm setting the Security Access Controls for a directory just after its been created, I was hoping that any files copied to that directory would inherit the settings of the directory, but they dont seem to be.<br />
      <br />
      Do I need to call EnableFileInheritance or anything?<br />
      Or am I just going to have to call GrantOnFile for each file?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think I've solved my other problem, just posting in case it helps anyone else.<br />
      <br />
      I'm now calling AccessControl::GrantOnFile for the directory, <i>after</i> I've copied over the files that need to inherit, this seems to work.</p>
