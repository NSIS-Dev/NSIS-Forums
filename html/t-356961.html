Up to now Windows 2008 and 2012 are OK. Google offers to run programs in XP-compatibility mode, but would be good to know if any other workaround exists.<br>I attached screenshots of error message, target system description and PE Explorer info for the distribution file.<br>Any ideas?<br>Thanks in advance ;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th March 2013 06:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Maybe they somehow managed to disable WOW64 emulation?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Aminifu</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th March 2013 06:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">If this is a work place system, maybe there are policies in place blocking installation of media players.<br><br>Also, as a side issue, a 3.4 Experience Index seems low for even an older Intel cpu and 4 GB of memory.

Strange that this happened on 6 computers in 2 different locations. Also customers might send incorrect information and package was damaged. On my Win7 64-bit English VM this not reproduces. I still hope to get access to one of the comps. What I really worry about is that some new MS KB* patch was applied to those systems. But while no other reports with the same situation, probably this is not NSIS compiler compatibility problem.<br>Thanks, Aminifu, fortunatelly media player is not included :). All comps equipped for server' purposes, so performance should be OK. But I'll ask to check this again. 32-bit application execution will be a part of WOW64 emulation check.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th March 2013 09:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Note that I have no idea if it's even possible to disable/destroy WOW64, let alone how.
