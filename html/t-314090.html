      <p class="post-content"><strong>Test for a Valid Certificate?</strong><br />
      Is there a way (or plugin) to test a digitally signed installer (with a code signing certificate), <b>from within that installer</b>, that the digital signature exists and valid?<br />
      <br />
      That is, the the file has not been tampered with after it was signed?<br />
      <br />
      I know how to do it visually, by looking at the corresponding Properties tab. Is it possible to do this programmatically from within the installer?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      Though I do seem to recall some signing solutions existing. Maybe someone else knows.</p>

      </blockquote>Not really a chicken-and-egg because I don't expect to read the installer's checksum for that: The digital certificate is appended and itself includes a stronger hashing of the entire file.<br />
      <br />
      The nice thing about those digital certificates is that if anyone modifies anything inside the file (e.g. infecting with a virus), one could see immediately from the tab that it is no longer signed by so called "verified publisher".<br />
      <br />
      So, all we really need is a way to look at this "tab" and tell go/no-go.<br />
      <br />
      Any idea how to do that?

      <p class="post-content">There is really no point to do this, NSIS already checks itself with a CRC (And "pirates" will get around it anyways, or just extract the files without running the installer)<br />
      <br />
      If you really want to do this, call Wintrust::CryptCATAdminCalcHashFromFileHandle (and WTHelperGetProvSignerFromChain or CryptCATAdminEnumCatalogFromHash?) and WinVerifyTrust with the system plugin<br />
