      <p class="post-content"><strong>Using UAC Exec as vista admin</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I have spend the last few days trying to create an installer that does the following:<br />
      <br />
      The installer is started with RequestExecutionLevel user and includes five sections. Four of those sections have functions that need to be executed as a user, those work fine.<br />
      The fifth section will start a executable, but it requires a vista admin account. The executable I try to start has the "RequestExecutionLevel admin" setting.<br />
      <br />
      I have tried to use the UAC plugin, but it will ask for a admin password when starting the installer. Most users will not require the fifth option and therefore I would like the installer to ask for an admin password only when choosing or executing the fifth option in the section list.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Example 1:</b><br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />install_no5:<br />  UAC::RunElevated<br />  UAC::Exec '' '"$INSTDIR\${APPFILE}"' '' ''<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      This causes the installer to ask for a admin password, but after logging in the installer starts all over again from the top and the executable does not start.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Example 2:</b><br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />install_no5:<br />  ExecWait '"$EXEDIR\Setup.exe"'<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      This causes the executable to run when the user is an admin, but when the user is not an admin he will not execute anything.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I hope someone can point me into the right direction with this issue.

      <p class="post-content">1:<br />
      It is not possible to elevate a process on the fly, only new processes, thats why it works this way<br />
      <br />
      2:<br />
      I'm not sure if I understand the problem here, but you might want to use userinfo::GetAccountType and disable the 5th section on your components page if the user is not a member of the admin group</p>

      I now have included the solution given to you in point 2.<br />
      <br />
      It's rather strange that a default user, running an installer in "RequestExecutionLevel user" mode, can not start a different installer with "RequestExecutionLevel admin". (You would think that you would just get the "administrator login screen", just as you would get when starting the installer through Windows Explorer)</p>

      <p class="post-content">A possible answer to that is that ExecWait uses createprocess and only ShellExecute will elevate when needed, createprocess just dies with an error.<br />
      If execshell works correctly but you need to wait, you could use UAC::ShellExecWait</p>
