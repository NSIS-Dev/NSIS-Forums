      <p class="post-content"><strong>SingleSelect in EmbeddedLists doesn't work</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      <br />
      The option 'SingleSelect' in the EmbeddedLists ListView doesn't seem to work.<br />
      I set the option to '1' but still I can select multiple items.<br />
      (The same thing happens in the 'ListView_MultiColumnCheckBoxes' demo)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Using the latest version (30 March 2010) (Standard version, NOT unicode)<br />
      <br />
      P.S.<br />
      Would it be possible to make the text for 'Select all / Unselect all' changable?<br />
      We have an installer in a different language and we need to change those texts as well.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Regards,<br />
      Johan</p>

      <p class="post-content">SingleSelect=1 works fine here. You may be confused as to what it's purpose is, though?<br />
      <br />
      Within the Windows UI language, a listbox item being selected means the user has selected the item itself (making it turn blue, etc.). This is unrelated to the checkbox. So when SingleSelect=1, it means that the user can't select multiple items using e.g. the Shift or Ctrl key. But they can still check/uncheck items freely.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not seeing anything in the EmbeddedLists documentation to allow only a single item to be checked. You can certainly do this yourself in the Page's Leave function - but there's no callback for when a user checks / unchecks an item to handle this more gracefully.<br />
      <br />
      That said.. if that's the behavior you want, you probably shouldn't be using a checkbox at all :) Just set CheckBoxes=0 and the stack in the Leave function will contain the selected item ( i.e. the blue one ;) ).</p>

      <br />
      I was expecting the same behaviour as from the .NET components we use.<br />
      We are forced to use checkboxes. (The customer insists on it)<br />
      <br />
      The 'blue' selected color is not visible, because we are using it on a 16 color display. (There it just remains white)<br />
      <br />
      It seems that I have to write my own plug-in that gives me the functions that I want.</p>

      <p class="post-content">a custom .NET component might have a radiobutton behavior option for a checkboxes listview - but I don't think the standard one does.<br />
      <br />
      Also odd that you would not see the blue color on a 16-color display. It's the same navy blue that Microsoft have used since at least Windows 3.1.<br />
      <br />
      But regardless.. if the client insists on checkboxes, and you need a radiobutton behavior on them, then yes.. you'll probably have to write your own (or check with Stu on whether he could implement it)</p>
