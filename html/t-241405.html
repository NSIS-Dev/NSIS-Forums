Should I try following the rules to fix the blue screen error and see if that fixes it?<br><br>Thanks.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Bio</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th March 2008 22:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS help</strong><br>Hi,<br><br>Iam sorry but i am facing the same problems where i can download or update any file from internet and i don't know how to solve his problem :( please if you can reply on me or contact me on msn: <a href="mailto:bassamzaatary@hotmail.com">bassamzaatary@hotmail.com</a> or yahoo <a href="mailto:bassamzaatary@yahoo.com">bassamzaatary@yahoo.com</a>.<br><br>Please i need your urgent help.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">lunaroja</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th April 2008 06:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hello,<br>I stumbled across this site in my frustrated search for a solution to this very annoying problem I am having. I sure hope that someone here can help me figure out what to do to fix this!!<br>My problem is extremely frequent NSIS error stating that the installer is corrupt or incomplete.<br>I bought this new computer in Feb this year, it is a Dell with Vista Home Premium. Recently I have been having this error message come up about 80% of the time when I try to download any sort of program. This happens with BOTH IE and FF and also using Download Accelerator and NOT using it. I am so frustrated, I have been trying to get AVG free anti-spyware on this computer. I was successful in getting the AVG anti-virus, but have been trying off and on for a couple days to download the antispyware, but I continually get the corrupt installer message.<br>I have done antivirus scans and come clean. I have an NVIDIA graphics card, but not a NIC that I know of (I am not that great with computers, but I can usually figure things out given enough time searching for answers). I also download things using Azureus and utorrent and I do not have any problems with any of my downloads using those programs.<br>I did succcessfully download the Free Download Manager and install it, and I am trying right now to download the AVG antispyware. Ok, that finished and the same dang thing happens!! I am so very frustrated with this and dont have clue what to do to fix this problem!!<br>I would be so very grateful for any help that anyone might be able to provide. Thanks in advance!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Greywacke</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd October 2010 18:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>NCIS Error: Error writing temporary file.
