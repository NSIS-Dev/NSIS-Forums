        </blockquote>Some feedback:<br>
        * My system is not located on C: and my programms are not installed in "program files", so any of your attempts to open MSIE directly fails with an error message.<br>
        Hint: Using ShellExecute(hwnd, "open", &lt;path to html file&gt;, ...) will work on all systems.<br>
        * makeNSIS can be found via registry instead of asking the user for its location.<br>
        * When makeNSIS fails e.g. with "file not found - aborting creation process", then the script was NOT compiled successfully, even if venis reports this ;)<br>
        * Using SDI is OK, but you should add the possibility to load more than one file, because the user surely wants to copy some code from other install scripts, when creating a new script. I suggest adding a button line at the bottom of the window to switch between the loaded files.

        <p class="post-content">Awesome! Hey do not be afraid to give me more suggestions. I originally thought of some kind of tabbing system for multiple files but opted to design with just one single file.<br>
        <br>
        Using myself at work, I was thinking about making a feature that would leave the file you last opened and keeping the same cursor position.<br>
        <br>
        I think I am going to make a forum/feature request page on the Venis website so others can request features.<br>
        <br>
        I want to make a feature to load different word files for the older builds of NSIS.<br>
        <br>
        If anyone has developed with Power++, I want to create a toolbar that can allow drag and drop programming. I may make an example with File and MessageBox functions and see if others would like this.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks,<br>

        <p class="post-content"><strong>Venis 1.0.2</strong><br>
        Venis, Visual Enviornment for NSIS, has been updated. A few minor additions and bug fixes are outlined in the history page.<br>
        <br>
        Next version of Venis will include unique features which will allow fast editing and development of NSIS scripts. Look for it in a month or two.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks everyone for the input!<br>
