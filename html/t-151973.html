When I make an installer, is this exe supposed to run on my PPC? Because when I run it on my PC it works fine but according to devbuzz.com I can use NSIS to make an installer for a PPC device. However, when I try to run the compiled install exe I get "This is not a PPC application". Help!<br><br>Here is my ultimate goal. I have a VS2003 application which runs on a PPC2003 iPaq 5550 device. It requires SQLClient, SQLCE, etc, to already be installed before the app can run. I am looking for a solution which can be carried on a storage card (there will be no PC onsite when these handhelds are setup). I need that solution to be an executable which first moves the 5 CAB files onto the device, then launches/installs them, then moves the main app onto the device and makes a shortcut in the start menu to that app.<br><br>I found NSIS from DevBuzz (<a href="http://www.pocketpcdn.com/articles/multicabinstall.html" target="_blank">http://www.pocketpcdn.com/articles/multicabinstall.html</a>) on how to run multiple cab files from a setup exe. But now I am SO confused as to how to compile an installer that works on a PPC rather than a PC. Does this product do what I need? If so, what am I doing wrong that it will only launch on a PC? Could it be that I have PPC2003 rather than a lesser version?<br><br>Any point in the right direction would be much appreciated!<br>Jenn</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 17:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">More recent NSIS releases use a lot of Windows API calls, whereas the older NSIS 1.98 does not.<br>Try the older <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nsis/nsis198.exe?download" target="_blank">1.98</a> version.<br><br>[edit]But thinking about it now, I'm not actually sure what you should do.[/edit]<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 17:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">More likely an NSIS dev member will know what to do, but I'm not sure that anyone here has encountered your problem/query.<br><br>Have you tried searching this forum too?<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 17:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">According to the script in that page you linked to, the installer should run on the computer the Pocket PC is connected to and not on the Pocket PC itself.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jenn5175</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 18:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">So NSIS is not meant to build something which runs on the standalone device?
