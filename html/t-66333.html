      <p class="post-content">First, I would like to say that this is awesome. Good job. I have to admit, your wizard was much better than mine. There are a couple of problems with the wizard, however. A couple of the back buttons and the exit button don't work. Also, in my wizard there was a start menu creator. Could that be added in there somewhere. Good job with the guy though. It's wonderful.:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi. I've seen slate blue before and like it. Anyway I've written an app known as cEdit (<a href="http://cedit.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://cedit.sourceforge.net</a>) or (<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cedit" target="_blank">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cedit</a>)<br />
      <br />
      It uses a control (codemax) for syntax highlighting. Anyway I built in support for the nsis language so if you want to have a look at it and strip bits you need from it to enhance your program feel free.</p>

      <p class="post-content">what a very generous offer. thank you much. i have also seen cEdit, and have to say it's great. i <b>am</b> hesitant, however, to include any OCX files that aren't needed. maybe the codemax ocx is needed :)<br />
      <br />
      thanks again,</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well probably not needed but it's an awesome control and it's opensource/free so both are solid aspects in it's favor. I was actually thinking of generating a plugin for cEdit to use to generate nsis scripts but I saw you already had something good going I couldn't see the point :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Might be cool. Perhaps you could create a slate blue plugin for cEdit. You'd be more than welcome to have a link to your site on it. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:devedit@yahoo.com">devedit@yahoo.com</a> :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Capturing the stdout &amp; stderr from a console program is just a matter of creating pipes, setting their handle in a startupinfo struct, executing the program and reading from the handle to get the text.</p>

      ackbar: i used the nsis dll provided by the great pjw62, which returns the compiler info via an hWND.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hello,<br />
      <br />
      can you (liquidmotion, pjw62, ...) please tell me how to get the NSIS-compiler dll?<br />
      On which version of NSIS is the dll based?<br />
      Is it difficult to make so an dll of a new (future versions) of NSIS?<br />
      Are the changes at NSIS to get a NSIS dll OpenSource?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thank you very much for your help!<br />
