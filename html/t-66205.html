      Attached to this message is a .nsh file like that supplied in some of the latest versions of PiMP for Japanese installers.<br />
      <br />
      To actually be able to create a Japanese installer though, I had to modify the resource.rc file to use the right language and code page obviously.<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure there's probably a means of doing this through the script (setting a code page and locale) so that the dialog can be modified on the fly, but for now I've only taken the quick and easy way out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm currently trying to make a japanese installer, but I'm having problems on windows 98, the text just displays at garbage. Can you tell me how you changed the codepage for the installer? I tried to change resource language in Project Settings and change all the dialogs to Japanese too. Then I get the following error when running the script:<br />
      <br />
      WindowIcon: off<br />
      Error removing window icon: IDD_LICENSE doesn't exist!<br />
      Error in script "term01.nsi" on line 23 -- aborting creation process<br />

      MakeNSIS don't find the dialogs. If I remove the WindowIcon off part, there are other dialogs missing.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The last fixes were made ny our distributor in Japan, so I don't have all the details. As far as I understand, all you really have to do is change the font in the resource file. Open exehead/resource.rc in your favourite text editor and replace all<br />
      <br />
      FONT 8, "MS Sans Serif"<br />
      <br />
      with<br />
      <br />
      FONT 8, "‚l‚r ‚oƒSƒVƒbƒN"<br />
      <br />
      Yes, it's supposed to look like that. Guess it's a multibyte name.<br />
      <br />
      I also changed the language of the dialogs to japanese. I'm not sure if this is necessary and some script-commands have problems finding the dialogs after this. "WindowIcon off" didnät work, so I had to disable the icons in the resource editor. It looks alright but not very dynamic.<br />
      <br />
      So, to summarize what I've learned. To get a japanese installer you have to:<br />
      <br />
      - change the font to one supported by the japanese OS<br />
      - make some changes to the resources if scripting doesn't work<br />
      <br />
      Hope this is helping anyone!</p>

      <p class="post-content">You don't have to change the font in the resources, you can use SetFont, much easier ;) And as I said, it works for me without changing the dialog language and I do remember it worked for other Japanese and Chinese users so I don't think you should change it. SetFont is enough.</p>

      The missing image is a problem though, I've noticed it happening on windows 95 machines for english installs too.

      <p class="post-content">The OS that build the script should make no difference.<br />
      <br />
      NSIS doesn't use Unicode (because that doesn't work on 9x), so you should set the language for non-Unicode applications to Japanese.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, so I'm still trying futher to debug this problem. What is seems like is that there's a problem with the install options dll, because in custom dialogs that I implemented with InstallOptions don't show up either in the installation.<br />
      <br />
      When I package the client on my windows 2000 pro machine at work and at home it works fine. But when I use our 2 different build machines (one is a win2k pro, the other is a win2k server). The only difference that I can immediately tell between these 4 machines is that on the 2 machines that it works is I've installed NSIS and NSIS workbench. In all situations our copy of NSIS is grabbed from source control to the machine and then is used to build the package. Does the NSIS installation update any system dlls that might be used by Install Options? I notice there's a comdlg32.dll dependency.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, so do you have any other idea of what could be the root cause? I realize that it could be a configuration error on my part, but I've narrowed several possibilities and still have the problem so it's a possibility that there's something else going on.<br />
      <br />
      Two packages built on two different machines using the same installer code base (NSIS), it's the exactly the same NSIS because it's checked into soure control. The resultant packages are exactly the same size - 1201KB. One package doesn't work properly on Japanese Windows 98, the text and image doesn't show up on the MUI welcome and finish page, and any custom dialogs don't have any text show up. The other package works as expected.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've run into a new problem creating packages with japanese fonts. When I specify the font in the Japanese language and build on a machine whose locale is set to EN_US, the installer comes out with large windows. When I specify the font in English on an English machine, it works fine except for Windows 98 as above. When I specify the font in Japanese on machine whose system locale is JP, such as:<br />
      <br />
      ; japanese font<br />
      !define MUI_FONT "‚l‚r ‚oƒSƒVƒbƒN"<br />
      !define MUI_FONT_TITLE "‚l‚r ‚oƒSƒVƒbƒN"<br />
      !define MUI_FONT_HEADER "‚l‚r ‚oƒSƒVƒbƒN"<br />

      SetFont "‚l‚r ‚oƒSƒVƒbƒN" 8<br />
      <br />
      Everything works as expected. The only problem with this is that our build machine handles builds for multiple locales, and I can't (through an Automated process) switch the locale because it requires rebooting. I think the problem is the font names are in English when the system's locale is set to English, even using the MS Windows 2k MUI and setting the user's locale to Japanese, the font names are still in English and somehow when the dialog properties are set they are either set incorrectly or just don't display properly on machines whose font names are in Japanese.<br />

      Any suggestions?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The problem is that NSIS converts the font name (and other texts in the resources) from MBCS to Unicode using CP_ACP and not the local code page. I do intend to add some more parameters to the language files so they can specify the code page, and a font name. For now you can create a special build of NSIS where every CP_ACP in DialogTemplate.cpp is replaced with the appropriate code page (you can find a list of code pages <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/unicode_81rn.asp" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
