</pre>i've already searched for a solution, but i'm not sure about what to search. what i have found so far is that it should have to do something with the example <b>one-section.nsi</b> and <b>.onSelChange</b> and <b>SectionSetFlags</b>. problem is, what i've found so far doesn't seem approaching my problem.<br>
      <br>
      can anyone help?<br>

      <p class="post-content">I am not really sure about this method but give it a try<br>
      <br>
      In the .onSelChange function Use the SectionGetFlags for the Section 1 and check if its selected by checking the SF_SELECTED flag. if so then Use the SectionSetFLags for the section 2. Now also check if section 2 is selected without selecting Section 1 by the above method. If so then deselect it by SectionSetFlags.<br>
      <br>
      I hope this helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'm very confused about how to do this stuff. i've searched again and found this topic: h t t p ://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=272007&amp;highlight=SectionSetFlags (so sorry guys for my double post)<br>
      <br>
      Afrow UK gives an very good example there on how to do this. i take his code and made an example installer (without the possibility to install of course). see this example in the attached file here.<br>
      <br>
      problem is that i don't really understand what's going on in this code.<br>
      another prob is that, you must select "option two" twice beforce the required "option one" is automatically selected.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      ps: if a forum moderator read this, i have two questions: why is it impossible two post a link to a nsis forum site and why is it also impossible to search for the keyword "winamp"?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here you go. I have modified the script to be executed correctly.<br>
      <br>
      How does it work??<br>
      <br>
      Assume 2 states which require modification<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      State 0 : When option 2 is selected option 1 needs to be selected.<br>
      <br>
      State 1: When option 1 is unselected option 2 needs to be deselected.<br>
      <br>
      I have initialized to state 0 in oninit. When it both the options are selected it automatically moves to state 1(since we need to keep checking if option 1 is selected). If option 2 are deselected it moves to state 0(since we need to keep checking for option 2 being checked so that we can check option 1).<br>
      <br>
      I hope my explanation helped.</p>
