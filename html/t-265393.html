There doesn't seem to be too much of a point in porting specifically NSIS to Linux. It doesn't have any features unique to Linux like package management and has way too much Windows specific instructions. The only things that'd fit both would be the pages and file extraction. I don't see how the vast investment would result in anything more than just another installer for Linux in which the package managers rule.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
