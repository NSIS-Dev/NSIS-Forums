It works now, but its god-aweful ugly. And don't worry, I'll send it to Justin ASAP.<br><br>Following is the README file for the release:<br>---<br><br>Changes in 1.44e:<br><br>- New command: ReadEnvStr<br>Reads an environment variable into $0-$9, $INSTDIR, etc. Examples:<br>. "ReadEnvString $0 PATH" puts the search path into $0<br>. "ReadEnvString $9 COMSPEC" puts the path to COMMAND.COM in $9<br><br>- New command: AdjustDiskSpace<br>Adds to or resets the section's disk space requrement. Examples:<br>. "AdjustDiskSpace set 20" resets space requirements to 20kb<br>. "AdjustDiskSpace add 100" increases requirements by 100kb<br>. "AdjustDiskSpace 100" ('add' is assumed)<br><br>- New command: ProgressText<br>Overrides the text label above the progress bar. Examples:<br>. "ProgressText set 'Checking registry'" is rather obvious<br>. "ProgressText auto" restores the default NSIS messages<br>. "ProgressText 'Removing temp files'" ('set' is assumed)<br><br>- Changes to command: Section<br>New /HIDDEN flag is just like having an empty section name or having the name begin with a "-". The section does not show up on the Components screen and is always installed. Example:<br>. "Section /HIDDEN 'this will not be seen'"<br><br>New /UNCHECKED flag means that the section will be visible on the Components screen but not originally checked. This has no effect if InstallTypes are being used. This also does not work on hidden sections, for obvious reasons. Example:<br>. "Section /UNCHECKED 'Create Desktop Icon'"<br><br>- Changes to command: CopyFiles<br>The third argument (size in kb of copied data) is no longer required. The new AdjustDiskSpace command is recommended instead. Example:<br>. "AdjustDiskSpace add 56"<br>. "CopyFiles 'C:\WINDOWS\notepad.exe' $INSTDIR"<br><br>- Other changes:<br>User choices are now saved when the Back button is used to return to the component selection screen.<br><br>NOTE: All changes are backwards compatible. No script should change behavior in the least when built with 1.44e.
