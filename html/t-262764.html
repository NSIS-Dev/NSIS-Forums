      <p class="post-content"><strong>Function and variable</strong><br>
      Hi,<br>
      <br>
      thanks Red Wine! It works fine. That means in your example the first two "CompletedText" are variables used by the function "LangString". The third "CompletedText" is a function call and the last "$(CompletedText)" is my variable again, seen as a string using $(...). Is that correct?<br>
      <br>
      Do you know what the preceding "^" means in "^ComponentText" in the delivered example?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks again for your precious help!<br>
      <br>
      Best regards<br>
      <br>

      <p class="post-content">My suggestion is (for everyone) read the documentation, examine the provided examples, search the forum and try solutions provided in related with your query threads, and finally post your query.<br>
      <br>
      Because sometimes this doesn't happen, (plus none says "man I don't like to read documentation and examine examples either, just give me the code I need") I always get confused to believe that all it needs is a couple of hints.</p>
