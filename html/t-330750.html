The issue you will have though is that the window title will probably change depending on the language. Your other problem is that you would need to use Exec rather than ExecWait to run your 3rd party program/installation. You can probably keep checking if the installation is complete by trying to delete the executable and checking the error flag (in a loop with said code). The changing window title is still a problem though.<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jai123</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2011 18:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Stu,<br><br>Thank you for the info.<br><br>I was planning to implement your suggestion, but then I realized that the main source of confusion for the users is the wizard appears every time a card is inserted.

This will avoid the hardware wizard. It is not a bullet proof approach since the user still can screw it up by inserting first the PCI card (which would be the natural thing for me).<br><br>That said, thank you for the reply.<br><br>Best</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2011 18:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><small>Originally posted by jai123</small><br>It is not a bullet proof approach since the user still can screw it up by inserting first the PCI card (which would be the natural thing for me).</blockquote>Actually lots of hardware nowadays warns to ALWAYS FIRST INSTALL THE DRIVERS BEFORE PLUGGING IN!!!111z0mg etc, so it's not that far of a stretch. And any tech-savvy user will still be able to do it his own way, so no harm done.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
