      <p class="post-content"><strong>Feature Request: info on installed components</strong><br />
      I would like to know which components have been<br />
      selected before actually installing these components.<br />
      <br />
      Right now, I'm installing the components and at the<br />
      end I'm checking which have been installed to pose<br />
      some questions....<br />
      <br />
      I know it's not possible with current NSIS but maybe<br />
      someone (Justin???) can help me solving this little<br />
      problem, because I'm not a C-programmer so I cannot<br />
      adapt the source code myself.<br />
      <br />
      Thx greatly,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, here is a patch for my hacked-up version. It's against version 1.67. With this patch applied, you'll get an NSIS which supports a variable <b>$SECTIONS</b> which is simply a string of all enabled section numbers. E.g. If you have 5 sections and the first and the<br />
      last are enabled, the value is "15".<br />
      <br />
      A usage example:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Function IsSectionEnabled<br />  exch $2<br />  push $1<br />  push $0<br />  strlen $0 $SECTIONS<br />loop:<br />  IntOp $0 $0 - 1<br />  IntCmp $0 -1 notfound<br />  strcpy $1 $SECTIONS 1 $0<br />  strcmp $1 $2 found loop<br />notfound:<br />  strcpy $2 0<br />  goto return<br />found:<br />  strcpy $2 1<br />return:<br />  pop $0<br />  pop $1<br />  exch $2<br />FunctionEnd<br /><br />Function Whatever<br />  push 2<br />  call IsSectionEnabled<br />  exch $1<br />  IntCmp $1 1 enabled 0 0<br />  DoSomethingIfSection2IsNotEnabled<br />  goto nomatch<br />enabled:<br />  DoSomethingIfSection2IsEnabled<br />nomatch:<br />  pop $1<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Apart from that, this patch also includes the following additions (i'm too lazy to sort that out for now :p ):

      <ul>
        <li>Support for .onDlgPage callback as described <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=65787" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

        <li>Support for "ExecDLL", see syntax below.</li>
      </ul><br />
      <b>ExecDLL Description</b><br />
      <br />
      Syntax:<br />
      ExecDLL <i>PathToDLL FunctionName ParameterString</i><br />
      <br />
      This loads the DLL specified in PathToDLL, and runs the function FunctionName of that DLL. This function must be exported of course, and declared like this:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />typedef struct {<br />        HWND hMainWindow;<br />        HWND HelpText;<br />        int  CancelId;<br />        int  BackId;<br />        int  NextId;<br />} tNSISparams;<br /><br />int fun(tNSISparams*, LPCSTR);<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      On calling this function, params are set with the following<br />
      values:<br />
      tNSISparams:<br />
      hMainWindow = HWND of NSIS main window<br />
      HelpText (currently unused)<br />
      CancelId = ID of cancel button<br />
      BackId = ID of "&lt; Back" button<br />
      NextId = ID of "Next &gt;" button<br />
      LPCSTR:<br />
      The value of ParameterString<br />
      <br />
      On return, the value returned by this function is pushed on the stack for evaluation in the script.<br />
      <br />
      <b>How to apply this patch</b>[list=1][*]Get cygwin from <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/" target="_blank">here</a>.[*]In cygwin's bash shell, cd into the source directory[*]Run <i>patch -p0 &lt; nsis-1.67misc.patch.txt</i>[/list=1]<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>thx...</strong><br />
      Fritz,<br />
      <br />
      I really thank you for your effort in answering my question.<br />
      The problem is, I have run into problems trying to install<br />
      CygWin, because I didn't know what to install and I didn't<br />
      want to wait to download all components because I have a<br />
      dial-up modem...<br />
      <br />
      And because I do not know anything about C or Unix, I'm not<br />
      such a pro, I'm just an ordinary econometrician...<br />
      <br />
      I will search for some info on CygWin and download it somewhere<br />
      and then I will try your patch!!!<br />
      <br />
      (But maybe Justin will have a new version of NSIS (1.68)<br />
      with this variable $SECTIONS available by that time.)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again,<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Encountered another problem..</strong><br />
      I should point out that I'm a complete novice when it comes to programming and VC++ so the following could very well be my own darn fault. Anyways, I did a reinstall of NSIS 1.67 and then applied the new patch from the .zip file. I got the following message:<br />

      <br />
      Obviously something's screwed up here (whether its me or the patch or my attempts at compiling the code). so if anyone can help out it'd be much appreciated as I'd really like to try out Felfert's .onDlgPage callbacks.<br />
      <br />
      Failing that, maybe someone could post/email me a compiled makensis w/ these extensions.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Petersa,<br />
      <br />
      your solution works, but...<br />
      <br />
      1) capacity in "Space required" field doesn't show correct values when you uncheck optional sections.<br />
      2) takes one valuable variable (we have only 10 of them)<br />
      <br />
      So, ability to query if section is checked or not would be really useful.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi nsfis. :)<br />
      <br />
      If you want to save the registers ($0-$9), why not use registry keys as variables, e.g.:<br />
      <br />
      WriteRegStr HKLM SOFTWARE\MyApp "Flag1" "1"<br />
      <br />
      You can treat this much the same way you would a variable, you just have to ReadRegStr and do a StrCmp before using it. :)<br />
      <br />
      Section "-checkflags"<br />
      <br />
      ReadRegStr $0 HKLM SOFTWARE\MyApp "Flag1"<br />
      <br />
      ;if flag is set, end this section<br />
      StrCmp $0 "1" SkipSection<br />
      <br />
      ;if flag is not set, go ahead with this section<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      SkipSection:<br />
      SectionEnd</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's actually quite a good idea!<br />
      <br />
      By putting stuff in a temporary key in the registry you can pretty much store all the information you need, and then remove it all with one command.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Has Everyone forgotten about IfFileExists????? OMFG!!!! No doubt it<br />
      would mean alot of code, but it is much more easier than hacking NSIS with somewhat useful products. Simple Solution:<br />

<code>Name MyApp<br />OutFile MyApp.exe<br />;blah<br />;blah<br />;blah (Normal install functions)<br /><br />Section "MySection"<br />File App.exe<br />SectionEnd<br /><br />Section "Plugin 1"<br />File Plug.dll<br />SectionEnd<br /><br />;If you have more than one file per section, <br />; then add them then use the first file for<br />; IfFileExists.<br /><br />Section -post<br />IfFileExists "Plug.dll" 0 noplug<br />; the zero is for going to the next line<br />; 1 will also do<br />RegDLL "Plug.dll"<br />noplug:<br />;Continue on with install functions.<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Now if that is hard to understand, sorry, but adding n-number lines Extra to see if someone has installed a certain section. Now if you have more items in the section, then just use the first file to check to see if the installer has installed the section, then do the appropriate code.<br />
