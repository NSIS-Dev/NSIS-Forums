      <p class="post-content"><strong>German license page texts</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I've just worked on creating an installer for a German client and they where very strict about the coiche of words in the license page. Their main issue was with the translation of the "license".<br />
      <br />
      In the language files this is called "Lizenz Abkommen". They didn't agree with it, they wanted it to be "Lizenzbedingungen".<br />
      <br />
      I've been told that the first translation is more of a contract agreement between two parties to which both agree. While the second is more in the line of a EULA.<br />
      <br />
      Since my german isn't good enough to make the distinction, I thought whoever did those translations might think about these things and possibly change them.<br />
      <br />
      Of course, I can customise those texts in my installer script (which I did). But if everybody has to do that...<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">My German is also not that good, but to me it seems like the difference between 'license agreement' and 'license terms'.<br />
      <br />
      If I'm correct, a license agreement contains license terms. Currently the title of the page is 'License Agreement' and it asks you to agree with the 'terms of the agreement', in German 'Bedingungen des Abkommens'.<br />
      <br />
      So to me it looks like the translation is correct. If your translators think otherwise, let me know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">what i dont like about the german translation in general, that people didn't think of german terms, but tried to translate word by word. think a lot of sentences could be more to the point.</p>
