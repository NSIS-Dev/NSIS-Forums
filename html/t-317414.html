      <p class="post-content">@jpderuiter: good point!<br>
      A workaround could be to extract &amp; run a small program in %TEMP% just before exiting the installer (make sure the working directory is also %TEMP%) and have it close Explorer windows (with SHChangeNotify) and remove the USB device.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry I should have provided a bit more detail.<br>
      <br>
      To eject the drive, I use a "RemoveDrive.exe" utility, from <a href="http://www.uwe-sieber.de/drivetools_e.html." target="_blank">http://www.uwe-sieber.de/drivetools_e.html.</a> This utility is pretty smart. It places a copy of itself in the temp folder and then runs the copy in temp.<br>
      <br>
      Also, I'm pretty confident the problem really is Windows Explorer. It seems odd that Windows Explorer would "lock" the drive ... just my "looking" at the drive. But that is what my testing has revealed.<br>
      <br>
      I'm going to look into SHChangeNotify and see how to use it &amp; if it works. I will have my .exe run from %TEMP%.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      THANK YOU for all the suggestions!</p>

      </blockquote>True in Windows XP and 2000, but in Vista and probably in Windows 7, open explorer windows on the drive will block the safe removal.

      <p class="post-content">Yeah ... the removable behavior has changed in Vista. I just re-tested this, to ensure I'm not crazy. I did my testing with my software closed ... I was just testing various USB ejection techniques and tools, with a single Windows Explorer window "looking" at the USB drive. So I'm very confident that this isn't related to a program still running on the USB drive. It is something new in Vista.<br>
      <br>
      I looked into SHChangeNotify but don't have the skills to put together a solution. I code a lot of languages but C++ isn't one of them, and I'm really not up on the Windows API. That's why I use NSIS anytime I need something Windowsy to happen ;)<br>
      <br>
      I tested different USB ejection tools and found that EjectUSB com will close Windows Explorer. ("EjectUSB â€“ Safe USB Ejection Tool" from pendriveapps dot com). It is smart about only closing the affected Windows Explorer instances.<br>
      <br>
      It isn't as fast as the RemoveDrive tool which I had been using. (Part of "Drive Tools for Windows" from uwe-sieber dot de). But it works, and it provides a return code so I can report success or failure to the user.<br>
      <br>
      I will probably end up embedding EjectUSB instead of RemoveDrive.</p>
