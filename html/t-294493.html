      <p class="post-content"><strong>Uninstall Wizard Cancel Button</strong><br />
      Hi<br />
      <br />
      At present our installer has the ability to uninstall a previously installed version. The process is as follows:<br />
      <br />
      Current state = application already installed.<br />
      <br />
      (1) User double-clicks our exe.<br />
      (2) Dialog appears saying application is already installed, and then says please wait whilst the application is being uninstalled, user presses [OK]<br />
      (3) Uninstall wizard appears.<br />
      <br />
      From here there is 2 different routes "next" and "cancel"<br />
      <br />
      [next]<br />
      Application uninstalls and then installs. Everythings good.<br />
      <br />
      [Cancel]<br />
      The uninstaller cancels but then the installer wizard appears and providing the user clicks [next] we install over whats already there leaving the application in a funny state.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way around this problem?<br />
      <br />
      Cheers<br />
      <br />
      Paul</p>

      <p class="post-content">The best way is probably just to add a check just after the uninstall is called to make sure it actually uninstalled the application. If not, display a message to the user and quit. (Use ExecWait to make sure it waits for the uninstall to complete before doing the check.)<br />
      <br />
      Your uninstall check could be something like checking for the presence of an old EXE, verifying a registry key, etc.<br />
      <br />
      This would have the added benefit of stopping the installation if some other glitch happened that prevented the application from properly uninstalling.</p>
