The install puts only links in the start menu of the logged user. I have put an uninstall shorcut available throught "Add/Remove Software" of Control Panel so it can be unsinstalled from ANY user session... If I uninstall from an other user session than those which was used to install it, the shortcuts are kept (but broken)... How to be sure to remove ALL shortcuts for all users (or just these of the user which was used to install) ?<br>2. The software uses a .dll file. If the software runs when uninstall is started, uninstall close it (Findwindow + SendMessage 16) but I don't know why .dll isn't deleted and so the INSTDIR stays (if the software aren't running it works fine). How to be sure the .dll file will be deleted ? (Note that if is a .txt file which the software read, it's the same thing : the .txt isn't remove)<br>A bonus question : What's the best way to close a software which have only an icon in the systray ?<br>Regards</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th August 2002 00:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">1) Use SetShellVarContext all before you create the shortcuts to make sure they will be created for all of the users, and then they could be easily deleted for all users.<br>2) Make sure the software closes all handles it has, and then you will be able to delete those files.<br>3) Find the window that controls the system tray icon and send it a ${WM_CLOSE} (defined in ${NSISDIR}\Examples\WinMessages.NSH).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Wyz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th August 2002 00:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Waow !

      <p class="post-content">That's still a bit confused..<br>
      I don't understand why SetShellVar all works but if current is specified, NSIS doesn't remember which one was used...<br>
      Drawing the state of the stack is an idea...<br>
      I hoped you could help me in writing this scan code but if I can't found it in the forum then I will try...<br>
      I will do a scan which put on the stack each Profiles folder it founds... Then reading from the stack, I will remove (hope I will succeed in doing that, not sure :( )<br>

      <p class="post-content">A stack is a very simple idea. The stack starts empty. You push things onto it one at a time and the stack grows. This is like adding plates to a stack of plates. When you "pop" one it means you take the top plate from the stack (which was the last one you "pushed" onto the stack).<br>
      <br>
      Push 'A' -- stack now contains one item, 'A'<br>
      Push 'B' -- stack now contains two items, 'A' on the bottom with 'B' stacked on top of it<br>
      Push 'C' -- stack now contains three items, 'A' at the bottom, 'B' above 'A', and 'C' above 'B'.<br>
      <br>
      When you pop you remove the items in the reverse order that you pushed them so...<br>
      <br>
      Pop $0 -- takes 'C' off the stack and places it into $0<br>
      Pop $1 -- takes 'B' off the stack<br>
      Pop $2 -- takes 'C' off the stack<br>
      <br>
      The stack is now empty again.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I <i>think</i> I see the problem. In the following line you should replace DeleteRegKey with DeleteRegValue</p>
      <pre>
<code>DeleteRegKey HKLM \ <br>"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\PushPin" \ <br>"StartMenuProgramsPath$1"</code>
</pre><br>
      I don't think this should have compiled as it stood, as DeleteRegKey should only take two full parameters (plus the optional "/ifempty" flag). I shall look into it. If it <i>did</i> compile (as it seems) then the third parameter must have been ignored resulting in the whole key being deleted.<br>
      <br>
      Hope that solves it for you...<br>
      <br>
      [edit] Confirmed this to be a bug, which I've just fixed. Once a new makensis.exe is uploaded, it should (correctly) refuse to compile your original function, until the first DeleteRegKey is changed to DeleteRegValue.

      <p class="post-content">It's for that it didn't work : the reg key were deleted when reading first entry and following couldn't be deleted (logical)...<br>
      I took me hours and hours to write this 2 functions (I couldn't figure out how to create a scan scode w/ NSIS commands) and I didn't use the good command, I need also to buy eyes :eek:<br>
      Thx to have pointed out this...<br>
      Two more things :<br>
      * This new makensis version require NLF v2 header, I got an error "bad language file version" (normal I think)<br>
      * I can't figure out why justin "Refresh uninstall panel" function (that I found on the Sunjummer site) doesn't work - reproduced here (not large kichick) :<br>
      Function un.RefreshUninstallPanel<br>
      Push $0<br>
      Push $1<br>
      StrCpy $1 ""<br>
      again:<br>
      FindWindow $0 "#32770" "Propriétés de Ajout/Suppression de programmes" ;French system (english one is "Add/Remove properties")<br>
      StrCmp $0 0 done<br>
      SendMessage $0 ${WM_CLOSE} 0 0<br>
      StrCpy $1 1<br>
