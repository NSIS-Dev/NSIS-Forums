      <p class="post-content">it's been mentioned a few times that it's from the cvs version of nsis. as for a new release it seems like there's a few things still needing to be sorted out / decided upon before that can happen with the ansi / unicode handling of things.<br />

      </blockquote>I'm looking forward to see Unicode support in the "official" NSIS release!<br />
      <br />
      Didn't know that we'll be able to enable Unicode support with a single attribute until now, that's cool :cool:

      <p class="post-content">can't wait to get home and play around with it. i always thought it'd make sense to mention in the manual which version of nsis introduced a new command.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i think it is more that at the moment the manual only is being taken directly from cvs or something like that (not normally an issue though with how long it is taking to get a new version finished i guess it's become more apparent though i might be wrong on that, heh).<br />
