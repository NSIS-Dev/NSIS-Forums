      </blockquote>Ok, I did some reading on Microsoft.com and can't find what types of files support just putting the dlls in the app directory. Now, on a test win98 box, I put all the files in the app directory, but I still had to register a few dlls for my software to work right.

      <p class="post-content">if you have to register the DLL, then in most cases this will cause your copy to be loaded for every application which uses that DLL. I may be wrong, but I don't think you have to register MSVCRT.dll<br>
      <br>
      If you put it in your app directory, then all should be fine.<br>
      <br>
      About the easiest method I've found to determine if a DLL needs registering is just to try it. Run regsvr32 from a command line with the path/name of the DLL as the parameter. If it says it can't find the entry point, then you don't need to register it.</p>

      </blockquote>remember that VB applications aren't programs in their own right, they contain a strap that loads the vb runtimes which in turn execute the byte code in the '.exe' file, thus the applications actual directory where code is executed is the system directory where the vb runtime dll file is ... I think (not sure though, I haven't used vb before.. this is just what I can tell from seeing vb programs).

      </blockquote>Yeah, I probably should've said that too.<br>
      <br>
      You need to first of all extract the file to a temporary location. /REBOOTOK will put the appropriate stuff into wininit.ini, so the file will be moved next time the machine starts up.<br>
      <br>
      This is neccesary as the installer will not be running as the machine is starting up, so the file must be extracted by the installer before the reboot. Wininit then does the moving.<br>
      <br>

      <p class="post-content">One silly thing to keep in mind, sometimes the $TEMP directory will be cleaned at shutdown, startup, or just by a user who wants to clean up. If you are going to extract files to rename on reboot, it would be better to put the files into $INSTDIR\temp or the destination directory but with a different extention. That way they stick around long enough to be renamed.</p>
