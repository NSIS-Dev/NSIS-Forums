      <p class="post-content"><strong>Background program</strong><br />
      At the request of Girdhari, I quickly put toghether a new background program in Delphi. It takes two arguments: bgfile and window title. Window title can be an empty string, then the titlebar disappears. The program scales a (preferrably large (so it looks nice on large resolutions too)) bitmap to full screen. A bitmap can be compressed a lot, so no problem there. But my Delphi exe is huge. Maybe someone can take this to C?<br />
      <br />
      A compiled version is too large to upload to this Forum but can be found on my homepage (including all source files).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <i>Edit1: I changed the source a bit to hide the taskbar button of the background window and to hide it from windows taskmanager.<br />
      <br />
      Edit2: changed again: made the taskbar disappear completely, so full screen installer.<br />
      <br />
      Edit3: made it ignore mouseclicks.<br />
      <br />
      Edit4: made extra option: hide taskbar or not.<br />
      <br />
      Edit5: changed taskbar behavior a bit.<br />
      <br />
      Edit6: added icon support.</i><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Is anyone actually interested in this program/utility. If not, I'll just stop developing it. Please let me know.<br />
      <br />
      Have fun with it, thanks for the effort, greetz,<br />

      KiCHiK developed a nice bgutility in C and we are currently testing and improving it. It supports bitmaps, sound (Wave) and taskbar hiding. Coming improvements are mp3 support and scaling of images.<br />
      <br />
      The first version is already available at the website of KiCHiK: <a href="http://kichik.********" target="_blank">http://kichik.********</a><br />
      <br />
      You can post replies here if you want to make a comment on the utility or have some bug report.<br />
      <br />
      KiCHiK, thx for the effort!<br />

      Balashanker has put the program to C. It's available on my homepage.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, it is now almost ready. No more can't find dll (stupid != instead of == :D), but for some reason it can't delete the DLL after it finishes. I can't seem to find why it can't. If someone knows why please tell me.<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      Thanks to Balashanker NSISBGImage will have resizing support tomorrow. Unless someone has an objection to StretchBlt. I have never tried this function so I do not know if its algorithem is a good one, plase comment.<br />

      [edit #2]<br />
      Documents are now in Windows format.<br />

      <br />
      [edit #3 <b>by Smile2Me</b>]<br />
      At a request of KiCHiK, the attachment has been deleted since there where problems with the DLL that doesn't get deleted. You will be informed about any news about this program.<br />

      <p class="post-content">That DLL not being deleted seems to be a more severe than just being a left behind :cool: ... Please consider this program as <b>beta</b> and don't distribute it with your installers. I have put my latest version of it on my site. Please help me identify the problem.<br />
      <br />
      If you don't see anything wrong with it just try running the installer a few times in a row... Just remember, Ctrl+Alt+Del contains shutdown option :D<br />
      <br />
      Damn hooks! They are everywhere!!!<br />
      <br />
      Oh btw, it can load JPEGs and GIFs now... ;)</p>
