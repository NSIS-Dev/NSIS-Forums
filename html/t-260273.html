      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      HOw would you access the Exe currently within the archive so that it can have its version checked against a currenlty installed version so that versions are not overwritten with a prior or equivalent versiobn<br />

      <p class="post-content">What macro? Are you talking about a file inside another archive and not your installer? You'd have to extract it first.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The executable in your install could only come from your local machine. Therefore, using GetDllVersionLocal should provide you with the correct version details. Include\Library.nsh provides a perfect usage example for your case, comparing the versions of a local file, also bundled in the installer, and a file on the user's system.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Do I need to have added it using File first?<br />
      <br />
      I have my script in a root directory and then all files to be installed are in a child directory called Install.<br />
      <br />
      However<br />
      <br />
      GetDllVersionLocal "Install\$ServiceExeName" $R0 $R1<br />
      <br />
      Can not find the executable..<br />
      <br />
      The command I use later on to add all the files to the Archive is:<br />
      File /r .\Install\*.*<br />

      <p class="post-content">There's no need to include the file in order to get its version. The problem in your script is that you use a variable in a compile time command. The compiler can't possibly know what $ServiceExeName will contain at runtime. Use the real file name, without any variables.</p>
