Add my function to StartMenu.nsi, along with this line<br>!define MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_STARTMENU_LEAVE StartMenuLeave<br><br>2. Compile and Run.<br><br>3. When the start menu page is displayed, change the default Start Menu Folder. For example, if 'Modern UI test' is displayed, change it to 'Modern UI test #2'. Then press the Next button.<br><br>4. Observe now, the message displayed in StartMenuLeave function.<br>The message says:<br>"at1 MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE = Modern UI test", or<br>"at1 MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE = &lt;empty&gt;" if you are running it for the first time. Or,<br>"at1 MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE = &lt;value from last run&gt;"<br><br>Observe the problem: what is displayed IS NOT WHAT YOU JUST TYPED INTO THE FIELD!<br><br>Conclusion: the function is not using the variable that contains the field the user entered.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Vytautas</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th June 2003 06:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">OK, This is a newly introduced bug, e.g. this script works fine with the CSV(2003-06-24) but not with the CSV(2003-06-27).
