However, it appears a lot of the information in the Forums no longer applies or is otherwise outdated or incomplete.<br><br>Unfortunately, *I* can't tell which is what.. (I managed to completely lock myself out of a folder a while ago and only got back in after denying myself and everybody else access first - err.) so I'm a bit stuck on half-worries.<br><br>I have tried my installer on Vista and found that, as far as I can tell, it works just fine. There's the whole 'unknown publisher' bit, which I believe can be fixed by paying somebody body (bah), but other than that.. no hitches.<br><br>My uninstaller seems to go well, too, but ends up throwing the "This program might not have installed correctly" dialog. No idea what's causing that.<br><br>So back to the main question - I'm sure others are wondering as well.. is there a 'guide' for building Vista installers / uninstallers? I checked the WiKi, but no luck there.<br><br>Thanks in advance :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd March 2007 10:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Everything should just work. To get rid of the "unknown publisher" you do need to pay someone to get a certificate. To get rid of the uninstaller warning, you should use RequestExecutionLevel which will add a manifest that'd cause Vista to avoid its automatic backward compatibility tricks.<br><br>There's also the issue of applications executed from the installer executing in the same context, the administrator context and not the user context. Andres has <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=265780" target="_blank">some solutions</a> for that.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Animaether</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd March 2007 12:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Cool, thanks Kichik..<br><br>That last bit will require some reading, there is a launch of IE from somed shortcuts involved.<br><br>P.S. The random ad-banner swooped me away from this thread to a site for drivecleaner, which was rather adamant about me installing it. Didn't, of course.. just a heads up :)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
