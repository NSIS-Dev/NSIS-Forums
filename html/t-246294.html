      <p class="post-content"><strong>Passing data through to !included files</strong><br />
      I have a set of similar installations based on one common NSIS script. Mostly the same fileset, but a different main exe, different product name, different Start Menu name, etc. (i.e. different versions for different customers).<br />
      <br />
      I use an external script to swap in the appropriate exe to a standard name before running the script.<br />
      <br />
      I have tried using 2 nsi files, as follows...<br />
      <br />
      product1.nsi<br />
      <br />
      !define APP_NAME "Product1"<br />
      !include "common.nsi"<br />
      <br />
      And common.nsi then uses APP_NAME for the Name, install dir, StartMenu naming, etc. But, APP_NAME doesn't seem to carry through to the second file. It only works if I define it in common.nsi. Any hints on how to make this work, or different ways of doing this?<br />
      <br />
      I've tried using a Var, but it doesn't seem to work either. I can define "Name" in product1.nsi, and it carries through to common.nsi, but that doesn't do everything I need it to do.</p>

      <p class="post-content">compile common.nsi and use a header with all needed info.<br />
      i.e. !include header.nsh where header.nsh could be like this:<br />
      !define APP_NAME 'my app'<br />
      !define VERSION '1.5.0.0'<br />
      !define MAIN_EXE 'c:\temp\myapp.exe'<br />
      etc</p>

      I don't understand how using a header file allows me to select at compile time which values to use. I would have to somehow selectively include one of several different .nsh files, or write several common.nsi files to include the different headers, which defeats the whole purpose of common.nsi.<br />
      <br />
      My external shell script knows about the different versions, but how can this information be handled in the NSI scripting?<br />
      <br />
      The shell script can copy the appropriate product1.nsh or product2.nsh to a standard name, product.nsh, and common.nsi can include product.nsh, but surely there's a nicer way...?</p>

      <p class="post-content">One thing that I do is create a separate EXE using an NSIS script that generates an custom page that asks the user options he/she wants to use. This EXE would then create a header file on the fly.<br />
      <br />
      Then, in your main script, add the following lines of code:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />!system "SelectBuild.exe"  ### this is the name of your EXE<br />!include "ProductVersion.nsh"  ### this is the header that is created<br />; the rest of your code goes here...<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      The attached sample script helps illustrate the header creation file.<br />
      <br />
      Anther option:<br />
      Pass a define using the '/d' command on MakeNSIS.exe and then use !ifdef blocks for each of your products.<br />
      <br />
      For more ideas, have a look at the NSIS help manual, compile-time commands (chapter 5)

      <p class="post-content">This goes back to my original solution of having multiple main files, that include common.nsi. And after trying this for several hours yesterday, I tried it again today, and it actually works now. I don't know what's different, but it is all good. Thanks for your help!</p>
