<code><br>HKLM Software\MyCompany\MyProduct Uninstall = $INSTDIR\uninst.exe<br></code>
</pre><br>
      And perhaps version information e.g.<br>
      <br>
      The newer version should try to read the registry for the old version info/uninstall key.<br>
      <br>
      If it exists, use<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>ExecWait $UninstallString <br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      to perform the uninstall of the former version BEFORE running into the Install section of the new installer.
