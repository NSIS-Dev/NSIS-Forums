      <p class="post-content">I may be [relatively] new to NSIS kichik, but I'm definitely NOT new to programming (having been one for for over 30 years). I *do* know the difference between compile-time and run-time checking, and I'm here to tell you this is most definitely *NOT* a run-time need. :)<br>
      <br>
      Thus your closing suggestion is unfortunately completely out of the question.<br>
      <br>
      And your first "hackish" suggestion is also rejected for being too, .. well, .. (forgive me) F'ing UGLY. ;)<br>
      <br>
      (Besides, IMO simply calling a <i>function</i> instead (which I had already considered and rejected BTW) would be much cleaner/clearer than invoking a macro)<br>
      <br>
      Your second hackish suggestion however, looks somewhat intriguing and MIGHT be a possibility -- if only I actually understood what you were suggesting that is! (which I don't!) :(<br>
      <br>
      Could you do me a favor and explain it a bit more please?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for the quick reply and thanks for NSIS itself too. Much appreciated. :)</p>

      </blockquote>Yes, thanks, that is what I decided to go with in the interim since luckily I don't (<i>yet</i>) have too many combinations to deal with. As the number of tests (comparison combinations) increases though, it <i>could</i> become quite cumbersome, which is what I <i>was</i> hoping to avoid.<br>
      <br>
      'Tis a shame though that NSIS doesn't (yet?) support the format/style I originally posted. Any chance of that perhaps sometime changing in the [hopefully] near future?? &lt;hint! hint!&gt; ;)

      <br>
      Unfortunately however, this technique, while slick, doesn't exactly help uncomplicate my code any. :(<br>
      <br>
      I mean, in order to use it the way I want to use it, I'd have to do something like:<br>
      <pre>
<code>!define _STD_INSTALLER  1  /* NORMAL installer WITHOUT any developer files */<br>!define _DEV_INSTALLER  2  /* With FishLib DEVELOPMENT FILES also embedded */<br>!define _MIN_INSTALLER  3  /* ONLY FishLib, to embed into other installers */<br>!define _WEB_INSTALLER  4  /* NO FILES embedded at all, downloaded instead */<br><br><br>/* We wish to test if INSTALLER_TYPE == 2 or INSTALLER_TYPE == 4 */<br><br>!define INSTALLER_TYPE_2                    /* (define what to test for) */<br>!define INSTALLER_TYPE_4                    /* (define what to test for) */<br><br>!ifdef INSTALLER_TYPE_${_INSTALLER_TYPE}    /* (perform the actual test) */<br><br>  ...(code)...<br><br>!endif<br>!undef  INSTALLER_TYPE_2                    /* (must always cleanup too) */<br>!undef  INSTALLER_TYPE_4                    /* (must always cleanup too) */<br><br>  ... (bunch of unrelated code) ...<br><br>/* NOW we need to test a completely different combination... */<br><br>!define INSTALLER_TYPE_1                    /* (define what to test for) */<br>!define INSTALLER_TYPE_3                    /* (define what to test for) */<br><br>!ifdef INSTALLER_TYPE_${_INSTALLER_TYPE}    /* (perform the actual test) */<br><br>  ...(code)...<br><br>!endif<br>!undef  INSTALLER_TYPE_1                    /* (must always cleanup too) */<br>!undef  INSTALLER_TYPE_3                    /* (must always cleanup too) */<br><br>  ...(etc)...</code>
</pre>As you can see, using this particular technique doesn't exactly make the code neat and clean, does it?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks anyway Stu and kichik, but I think I'm going to stick with Don's suggestion (which I had already figured out on my own) until such time as NSIS can be fixed. At least with his technique I can hide all my needed !defines in a !included header somewhere and then just use a simple, SINGLE, !ifdef whereever I need to, thereby preserving the simplicity/readability (and thus <i>maintainability</i>) of my code.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for everyone's help folks. Much appreciated.

      <p class="post-content">Hi David<br>
      <br>
      Depending on how your bitwise logical operator skills are, you could also use an approach similar to this (which is based on using bitmasks in C) by getting creative with the /math option for !define:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>!define Standard    0x00000001<br>!define Development 0x00000002<br>!define Web         0x00000004<br><br>!define /math InstallerType ${Standard} | ${Development}<br><br>!define /math IsStandardInstaller            ${InstallerType} &amp; ${Standard}<br>!define /math IsDevelopmentInstaller         ${InstallerType} &amp; ${Development}<br>!define /math IsStandardDevelopmentInstaller ${IsStandardInstaller} &amp; ${Development}<br><br>!if ${IsStandardInstaller}<br>    !echo "standard installation"<br>!endif<br><br>!if ${IsDevelopmentInstaller}<br>    !echo "development installation"<br>!endif<br><br>!if ${IsStandardDevelopmentInstaller}<br>    !echo "standard and development installation"<br>!endif<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      and so on.<br>
      <br>
      I don't know how this would work out for you, but it could be worth trying out, particularly if work through some of the other combinations of the bitmasks to reflect your desired logic.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      -------------------------<br>
      &lt;hint&gt; Try changing your "InstallerType" to just "Standard" (it will NEVER be more than one value at the same time!!) and then show the code necessary to test whether the passed "InstallerType" is EITHER "Standard" -OR- "Development". Do that and I think you'll see your technique is actually worse than Don's since it takes more code to setup the combination-value tests.
