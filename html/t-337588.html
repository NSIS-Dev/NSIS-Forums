      <p class="post-content"><strong>Legacy Drivers &amp; Win7 x64</strong><br />
      Hey guys.. first time posting here.. but i have been browsing these forums for quite some time.<br />
      <br />
      I am a huge fan/user of NSIS.<br />
      While many have converted to PAF, i faithfully am sticking by.<br />
      <br />
      I have successfully compiled many Portable Launchers for my apps.<br />
      and have run into many problems, but always found an answer by trial &amp; error/research.<br />
      <br />
      Until now: i have been frustrated for many weeks now.<br />
      <br />
      Problem: i can't seem to delete legacy registry keys.<br />
      My OS: Win7/64<br />
      <br />
      I have tried Access::Control plugin without success.<br />
      <br />
      The problem is the key can only be deleted under 'System'.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone have any ideas?<br />
      Thanks in advance</p>

      <br />
      Did you take ownership of the key with AccessControl::SetRegKeyOwner before changing the ACL as admin?<br />
      <br />
      Did you check with Process Monitor to make sure this is a access denied issue?<br />
      <br />
      Are you using SetRegView?</p>

    hey Anders,<br />
    thanks for mentioning PsExec..<br />
    that's what im using to delete legacy keys ..<br />
    <br />
    however.. i have seen apps use AccessControl to delete legacy keys, but when i run those apps on my computer.. it doesn't work.<br />
    <br />
    i have also ran into SetACL, which in it's documentation, says: "can be used to delete those pesky legacy keys".<br />
    <br />
    neither of which works..<br />
    <br />
    and yes.. i tried setregview, SetRegKeyOwner first, etc..<br />
    <br />
    on my computer.. legacy keys are registered to "System".<br />
    is this the case just for Windows 7?<br />
    <br />
    i have been looking into this for quite a while and it seems im the only one who seems to have a problem deleting legacy keys.<br />
    <br />
    i can use PsExec.. but if i could find an alternative.. it would be better.. as PsExec scares people.. they think im trying to "secretly take over" their computers.. lol.<br />
    <br />
    thanks for any other suggestions/tips.<br />

        </blockquote>this post is rather old, and i completely forgot about this.<br />
        <br />
        i was able to figure it out using Access::Control.<br />
        my syntax was incorrect.<br />
        <br />
        although.. i wish there was a /r (recursive) switch.<br />
        it would save a lot of coding.
