I made an installer, and now I'd like to improve the way it reinstalls (uninstalls previous installation and installs). I have three solutions:<br><br>- a pop-up question "Would you like to reinstall" in onInit that if yes deletes the files etc but does not show progress (seems to user that program disappeared/stopped working)<br><br>- like the above but it pops up the old uninstaller with execwait. I don't like this because a dumb user could be confused with the two windows and mess up the reinstallation process.<br><br>- I tried to solve these problems by having a solution where the uninstall stuff was done in the install section if a previous install was detected, but it was still asking for the new installation's directory before uninstalling which was kind of messy.<br><br>What I actually want to do is pop up the question if a previous installation is detected, then an uninstallation page (with progress etc), then ask for instdir, then install. Is there an "easy" way to do this?<br><br>Sorry if this question was answered before, I did search.<br>Thanks in advance!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd May 2007 19:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Have a section which is hidden and not checked by default (Section /o "" SecUninstall) that uninstalls the old installation.
