Doing that was pretty easy and just required a:<br><br>WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers" "$INSTDIR\filename.exe" "WIN98 DISABLECICERO"<br><br>However, the problem is the shortcuts to it created by NSIS. When you right click a shortcut, it displays all the proper information in the compatability tab, however when you run it, it results in the crash you get if compatability mode is not set.<br><br>Running the actual EXE in the install folder works perfectly. In fact, if I go to that EXE and click "Create Shortcut," rename it to the shortcut produced by NSIS, and copy it over the NSIS file, the shortcut now works fine.<br><br>I already scanned the registry for the .lnk to see if there were specific compatability mode settings for it and there don't appear to be.<br><br>I'm hoping someone a bit more experienced with NSIS might have an idea what I can do about this. Thanks.<br><br>Quick Edit: I already tried adding a registry entry for the .lnk file like I did for the EXE, but that appears to have no effect.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dboy</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th August 2003 19:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Fixed</strong><br>Thanks to some help from developer in #nsis, I got this working :)<br><br>It turns out it was due to what SetOutPath was set to. After installing all program files, I had to install some windows fonts so I descended into $WINDIR\Fonts.<br><br>This causes all CreateShortcuts to use $WINDIR\Fonts as their "Start In" path which breaks compatibility mode for some quirky reason.<br><br>The fix was to, after installing all files, set SetOutPath pack to $INSTDIR.<br><br>Everything works great now.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
