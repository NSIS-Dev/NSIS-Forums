      <p class="post-content"><strong>Removing directory upon installation with new installer</strong><br />
      Hey all.<br />
      I've searched everywhere, went the trial and error route, and still no luck. Here's what I'm trying to do:<br />
      <br />
      I have an application that saves user data to the common application data folder (C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\My company\my application). The uninstaller I created for this app does not remove this application data folder...no biggie. However, I have an update to this application, and I would like it to remove the user's application data folder during the installation as to avoid conflict with my updated application.<br />
      <br />
      I've tried placing delete variables in every section, creating new callback functions, and nothing. Please note, I'm a fairly novice user, and any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
      Thanks for reading :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Have you tried:<br />
      <br />
      RMDir /r 'C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\My company\my application'<br />
      <br />
      This will delete the directory and all contents, so be careful.<br />
      <br />
      "Note that the current working directory can not be deleted. The current working directory is set by SetOutPath."<br />
      <br />
      See additional notes on this in the users manual.<br />
      <br />
      So you might need to do something like:<br />
      SetOutPath 'C:\someotherexistingdirectory'<br />
      RMDir /r 'C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\My company\my application'<br />
      <br />
      This is untested code, I think you might need to use double back slashes or forward slashes. Beucase the \ might be treated liek an escape sequence.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: Also note that deleting things from All Users might require administrative priviliages.<br />
      <br />
      You can add the /REBOOTOK flag to allow the delete to occur after the computer reboots. This is useful if the user has that folder open which might prevent the deletion, or if a file in the folder is opened/locked by some app.</p>
