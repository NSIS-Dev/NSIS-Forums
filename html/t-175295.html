I normally use this UI for installers that download things, like updates or something. When I download things the loading bar just stops in the middle until the download is done then starts moving again. If it's like a 3MB download, and the persons on dial-up it can take a while to download and the bar just sits there. Is there a way to make it so that when NSISdl is called it replaces the text area with another loading bar to show the download progress? Or could it replace the loading bar already there for a loading bar that shows download progress?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Yathosho</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th June 2004 21:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">would be nice to have some combination of a splash with that progressbar, since i'd be interested in using a ui like this progress-bar (with an image above).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Shea</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th June 2004 22:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Maybe deguix will make some more of them just for us! ;-)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">deguix</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th June 2004 23:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>Maybe deguix will make some more of them just for us! ;-)</blockquote>Sorry, right now I can't, I'm working more on InstallOptionsEx project than even using NSIS.

I think you can run the loading bar first (with <i>Wait</i> command and use System plugin to position the loading bar below the image (or somewhere else). Anyways, it's ever better to have a plugin to do all that for you, isn't it?<br><br><blockquote>Is there a way to change the UI so it shows another progress bar under it?</blockquote>You can't do that without creating another plugin. However you could make show the banner bigger enough to support the original appearance of instfiles page when using NSISdl (without the buttons).</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Shea</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th June 2004 01:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I resized it to show the download progress bar.
