      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I'm trying to build NSIS on HP-UX environment.<br />
      I have installed Python-2.5, scons-0.96.95 and trying to install nsis-2.24.<br />
      <br />
      I tried to install using:<br />

      <br />
      and that's the log:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey, I got it working...after giving up and looking into some other issue, we stumbled across an HP compiler option "+u1" which allows for unaligned access. Anyone know if there is a corresponding gcc option for this?<br />
      <br />
      So here is a crude script containing some patches--don't know if they are all really needed. I know a lot more about GNU autotools than 'scons'. It seems like it ought to be easier to pass compiler flags/options without patching files to do it, but maybe I'm just missing something.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, compiler options that only work with one compiler probably shouldn't be forced on other compilers (-Wall and -m32 come to mind).<br />
      <br />
      Also the test for big endian appears to get it wrong for HPUX ia64, which is why I force the -D entry for it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To add compiler flags or linker flags, you can pass APPEND_CCFLAGS or APPEND_LINKFLAGS in the scons build line.<br />
      <br />
      -Wall and -m32 aren't forced on any compilers because the file that adds them (SCons/Config/gnu) is specific to gcc.<br />
      <br />
      The test for big endian is pretty simple. If it failed, it's probably because the environment wasn't properly set when it was ran. To verify, delete .sconsign.dblite and .sconf_temp and run scons again. Then you can see exactly what happens in config.log.</p>

      <p class="post-content">We have 3 compilers on our system:<br />
      <br />
      (1) hpux ansi c and c++:<br />
      <br />
      /usr/bin/cc<br />
      /opt/aCC/bin/aCC<br />
      <br />
      (2) gcc (I think it was version 3.4) packaged by hp<br />

      /opt/hp-gcc/bin/g++<br />
      <br />
      When I do no patches, it seems to select /opt/aCC/bin/aCC for c++ and /usr/local/bin/gcc for c (this last bit about gcc I will re-confirm when I get to the office).<br />
      <br />
      And then "-Wall" is an error to /opt/aCC/bin/aCC.<br />
      <br />
      I'm using scons 0.96.96.<br />
      <br />
      I'm willing to learn and help to get any of this nicely fixed (I know not everyone has access to this platform). Let me know what you would like from me and I can try to provide it (unfortunately I cannot provide direct login access to our hardware).</p>

      ... the precise version is 3.4.3<br />

      Re: "When I do no patches, it seems to select /opt/aCC/bin/aCC for c++ and /usr/local/bin/gcc for c."<br />

      Thus, the first un-patched error looks like this (notice "Using GNU tools configuration", how do I get it not to use that, since the aCC compiler became selected?):<br />

      So the bad test was really a symptom caused by the bad combination of gcc with aCC noted earlier.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>SCons first tries to use hpcc and hpc++ before it looks for gcc. You can see this logic its source code near the bottom of SCons/Tool/__init__.py. Since it doesn't find hpcc, something must be wrong with SCons/Tool/hpcc.py.</li>

        <li>Since those tools have a different set of flags and probably issues, a new NSIS build configuration must be created for them. Copy SCons/Config/default to SCons/Config/hpux and modify as needed. For the build system to use it, add the following to SConstruct.
          <pre>
<code>elif 'hpcc' in tools:<br />        envs = SConscript('SCons/Config/hpux')</code>
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Next come the build errors. I can see three types of errors.

          <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li>Silly conversion issues like that assert line. 0 needs to be converted to pos_type.</li>

            <li>DWORD conversions that are actually pointer conversions. ptrdiff_t or size_t should be used instead. This includes that ConvertEndianness which has no conversion at all.</li>

            <li>DWORD not being prolery defined. If DWORD is not 32-bit on ia64 it must be fixed. If DWORD isn't 32-bit, all of the structs definitions are worthless.</li>

      <br />
      Here is what I have working so far. It is attached as a build/patch script and the output of it.<br />
      <br />
      (I know it only patches SConstruction and SCons/Config/gnu, but I'm still clueless on them).<br />
      <br />
      Interestingly, it builds 5 out of 6 examples under "Examples/Modern UI". The one it fails on is MultiLanguage.nsi as follows:<br />
      <br />
      Removing unused resources... Done!<br />
      Generating language tables...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Just above the elif line you've added to the SConstruct file there's an elif line for the gnu configuration. Either put hpux line first or remove the gnu line completely for test purpose. This assumes you already have a configuration file for hpux in SCons/Config, which you don't have. At least according to the patch.<br />
      <br />
      Unicode conversion usually fails because of a missing codepage. Your iconv probably doesn't support one of the codepages used by the language files. You can have `create_code_page_string` in Source/util.cpp print out the codepages it tries to initialize to find out exactly which one is missing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So I printed 'tools' and here is what came out:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>

</pre><br />
      <br />
      I assumed then that I should have this in SConstruct:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />print tools<br />if 'msvc' in tools or 'mstoolkit' in tools:<br />        envs = SConscript('SCons/Config/ms')<br />elif 'hpc++' in tools:<br />        envs = SConscript('SCons/Config/hpux')<br />elif 'gcc' in tools:<br />        envs = SConscript('SCons/Config/gnu')<br />else:<br />        envs = SConscript('SCons/Config/default')<br /><br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      However, it still tries to use gcc instead of /usr/bin/cc (symlink to /opt/ansic/bin/cc, the HP ANSI C compiler, as installed by HP):<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br /><br />/opt/aCC/bin/aCC -o build/release/makensis/clzma.o -c -mt<br />  +u1 -D_WIN32_IE=0x0500 Source/clzma.cpp<br />gcc -o build/release/makensis/crc32.o -c -mt +u1<br />  -D_WIN32_IE=0x0500 Source/crc32.c<br />gcc: +u1: No such file or directory<br />cc1: error: invalid option `t'<br />scons: *** [build/release/makensis/crc32.o] Error 1<br />scons: building terminated because of errors.<br /><br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      I know its now picking up the SCons/Config/hpux file, but I'm not sure how that file should be altered, given that scons seems to want gcc for its c compiler.<br />
      <br />
      (Just FYI, I'll be leaving for the weekend, but can pick this back up on Monday ... thanks for all your help!)

      <p class="post-content">As it turns out, the aCC compiler is all that is needed, since it has this option:<br />

      <pre>
<code>-Ae        In aC++, invokes aCC as an ANSI-C compiler</code>

      I've found that just because aCC exists doesn't mean /opt/ansic/bin/cc does. So I've make a small change in the script to allow compiling with just aCC.

      <ul>
        <li>It's definitly a problem with SCons as it doesn't properly find aCC when it's actually there. But the temporary fix should work. However, it should check for the necessity of the change.
          <pre>
<code>if 'gcc' in defenv['TOOLS']:<br />  defenv['CC'] = defenv['CXX'] + ' -Ae'</code>
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>I think it'd be better to check for _BIG_ENDIAN with a configuration test, just like in SCons/Config/gnu. A simple #ifdef can make sure the test program will return 1 in case _BIG_ENDIAN is defined.</li>

        <li>Currently, your hpux changes the build flags for everything built. It allows you to build makensis but not the rest. I think the best thing here would be to extract most of the mingw stuff from SCons/Config/gnu to SCons/Config/posix and use that in both SCons/Config/gnu and SCons/Config/hpux. This way, everything could be built on HP-UX and there'd be no code duplication. I think some of the flags, like -g, are also common to the two configurations. Let me know if you're up to it.</li>

      </blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>As far as I can tell, it does find aCC with no issue. And on any HPUX system, until there is some unaligned option, gcc/g++ cannot be used to build makensis, so aCC is exactly and only what is needed.<br />
        <br />
        Given that we are using the scons detection of aCC to drive the process into using SCons/Conf/hpux, it seems correct to say that if we are in SCons/Conf/hpux, CXX = 'aCC' and thus CC must be 'aCC -Ae', no matter what scons says, even when all scons bugs are fixed.<br />
        <br /></li>

        <li>I think it'd be better to check for _BIG_ENDIAN with a configuration test, just like in SCons/Config/gnu. A simple #ifdef can make sure the test program will return 1 in case _BIG_ENDIAN is defined. Hmmm...shouldn't this then be a 'global' test instead of a platform-specific test?<br />
        <br />
        And if so, then shouldn't the test itself never look to see what the compiler defines, but always provide the 'correct' answer to the question of whether a system was big endian or not, thus avoiding the problem if two different compilers are used, once for CC and one for CXX, that give different #defines automatically?<br />
        <br /></li>

        <li>Currently, your hpux changes the build flags for everything built. It allows you to build makensis but not the rest. I think the best thing here would be to extract most of the mingw stuff from SCons/Config/gnu to SCons/Config/posix and use that in both SCons/Config/gnu and SCons/Config/hpux. This way, everything could be built on HP-UX and there'd be no code duplication. I think some of the flags, like -g, are also common to the two configurations. Let me know if you're up to it.</li>
      </ul>Yes I was wondering about this last night. We don't have the option of installing any cross compiler onto these systems so I don't have a way to test cross compilation.<br />
      <br />
      However, I'm wondering if there wouldn't be an elegant way so that the same mingw cross-compilation environment could be used and then that could be included into the specific hpux or gcc files that are building makensis.<br />
      <br />
      I'll definitely look at the gcc file to try to emulate that so the makensis compiler options are only used for makensis, but I don't know how to be elegant regarding a cross compilation mingw environment using scons.

      <p class="post-content">It doesn't find aCC (the C compiler) and that's why it loads gcc. Look in SCons/Tool/__init__.py and you'll see this logic. I also forgot to mention that '-Ae' should go into CCFLAGS and not CC.</p>
      <pre>
<code>defenv.Append(CCFLAGS = '-Ae')</code>
</pre>Regarding _BIG_ENDIAN, I prefer not to run tests that aren't really needed. With Visual C++, this isn't required because we're always building for Win32 and on GCC it's only required sometimes. It'd be semi-global if the split is made from SCons/Config/gnu into SCons/Config/posix.<br />
      <br />
      Cross compilation environments aren't so elegant in SCons, but already dealt with in the gnu configuration file. There's a function there that converts a given environment to a cross-compile environment.

      <p class="post-content"><strong>nsis scons paradigm</strong><br />
      I've not yet submitted a patch, because I'm still confused as to the mindset I should use when thinking about scons changes, specifically relating to selecting compilers and paths ($CC, $CXX, $PATH) on unix environments.<br />
      <br />
      I'm an avid autotools user (autoconf, automake, libtool), so I tend to start with the idea that $CC, $CXX, $PATH can be determined by the person running the build.<br />
      <br />
      When I patch nsis to accept my PATH, scons finds all my compilers on hpux ia64, but prefers CC=/opt/ansic/bin/cc and CXX=/opt/aCC/bin/aCC over any of the others.<br />
      <br />
      On hpux, it is possible that one might have /opt/aCC/bin/aCC, but not /opt/ansic/bin/cc.<br />
      <br />
      It may also be possible that the hpux user would want to select /opt/hp-gcc/bin/gcc and /opt/hp-gcc/bin/g++ over any of the other installed compilers.<br />
      <br />
      There are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=1470826&amp;group_id=22049&amp;atid=373085" target="_blank">options</a> for each of these scenarios which will allow for unaligned access on hpux.<br />
      <br />
      But currently, it is does not seem possible for the builder to determine PATH, CXX, and CC within nsis. I'm curious if this is your preference?</p>

      <p class="post-content">SCons doesn't provide much of a convenient user interface for selecting the compilers used to build. When you build an environment with the default values, it'll load what it thinks is best. Then it'll go on and search additional peripheral tools. It's also possible to pass a list of tools to load instead of this default behavior.<br />
      <br />
      The tools define far more than just the path of the compiler. They define required flags, available builders, file extensions, etc. Tool definitions are made of code, so they are able to perform complex searches. Take NSIS/SCons/Tools/crossmingw.py for example, which searches for the right compiler.<br />
      <br />
      Add the Options list only being able to perform on an already existing environment with a loaded set of tools and you get (1) an ugly hack to load specific tools and not the defaults, (2) inability to define just the compiler path and (3) errors about missing builders when using an incomplete list of tools (i.e. no tool for C selected).<br />
      <br />
      Number 2 has a very good reason and I actually like that about SCons. Number 1 can be solved by using ARGUMENTS, which I forgot about. Number 3 must be handled by the user with a little help from the build scripts that add the tools that are always required - namely `zip`. It can also be solved by adding a tool selection mechanism to SCons which will allow selecting a specific tool for a specific task while allowing tools for other tasks to be automatically detected.<br />
      <br />
      I've now added the TOOLSET option to SConstruct which allows passing a comma-separated list of tools to load instead of the default. It assumes the user selects a tool for each required task. Instead of directly selecting the C compiler, it asks for a name SCons builder to do the task. Flags can still be added with APPEND_CCFLAGS and APPEND_LINKFLAGS.<br />
      <br />
      Which of the options work on GCC? Does the unalign lib work on GCC as well?</p>

      </blockquote>Compiling with gcc/g++ seems to work fine with the following approach on hpux ia64:<br />
      <br />
      1. since there are no headers for allow_unaligned_data_access(), one must define it:<br />
      <br />
      extern "C" { void allow_unaligned_data_access(); }<br />
      <br />
      2. then at the beginning of main():<br />
      <br />
      allow_unaligned_data_access();<br />
      <br />
      3a. finally, on Itanium link:<br />
      <br />
      -lunalign<br />
      <br />
      3b. or on PA-RISC link:<br />
      <br />
      -lhppa<br />
      <br />
      But of course, this means there must be some way of knowing you are on these platforms so as to select the correct actions.

        <br />
        I think the only remaining issue in the patch is that I've incorporated the PATH, so it can find the various tools, since on my HP system they are as follows (and who can predict where others may have installed their tools):<br />
        <br />
        /opt/aCC/bin/aCC<br />
        /opt/ansic/bin/cc<br />
        <br />
        /opt/hp-gcc/bin/gcc<br />
        /opt/hp-gcc/bin/g++<br />
        <br />
        /usr/local/bin/gcc<br />
        /usr/local/bin/c++<br />
        <br />
        However, I'm open to discovering or being shown other issues :)<br />
        <br />
        It should work for both gcc/g++ and aCC on both PA-RISC/Itanium on all HP-UX.<br />
        <br />
        To use g++/gcc instead, change from:<br />
        <br />
        TOOLSET=hpc++,hpcc,hplink<br />
        <br />
        to:<br />
        <br />
        TOOLSET=g++,gcc,gnulink<br />
        <br />
        Also, be sure your PATH contains all the locations of the tools you plan to use.</p>

        <p class="post-content"><strong>UCS-2LE not available under HP-UX</strong><br />
        Hello folks,<br />
        <br />
        I have tried deckrider's patch (applied to NSIS 2.28), and I have had to make a few other tweaks to get the install compiler built. However, the setup.exe generated hangs on our windows box. Perhaps I can confirm that the tweaks I have made are not too harmful.<br />
        <br />
        I am running things on an rx2600 (IA) HP-UX 11.23 (the 0505 release) with the following compiler versions<br />
        <br />
        B3901BA C.11.23.09 HP C/ANSI C Developer's Bundle (S800)<br />
        B3913DB C.05.55 HP aC++ Compiler (S800)<br />
        <br />
        Using HP's C++ compiler the anonymous unions in ResourceEditor.h were considered errors. So as a work around, I named them _a and _b and modified the source code to reference them. Ugly, I know, but wanted to get around that for now.<br />
        <br />
        I then modified deckrider's hpc++ configuration to add +W829 so that a number of warnings about deprecated constant conversions would be ignored.<br />
        <br />
        I then had to tweak util.cpp, to change "CP1252" to "cp1252", and "UCS-2LE" to "UCS-2BE" in order for HP-UX's iconv_open() to accept the arguments. However, the use of UCS-2BE most likely means that I cannot use nsis-2.28.zip pre-compiled contents, as those executables use UCS-2LE, right?<br />
        <br />

          <li>ResourceEditor.cpp, ResourceEditor.h, util.cpp: remove anonymous unions; this is a hack fix, which I did not like doing, but I didn't find a compiler switch to enable this behavior; also for util.cpp, the new and delete operator definitions conflicted with HP-UX C++ header files.</li>

        Note that HP-UX's /usr/bin/patch does not work with the patch files listed above. So the source tree might first have to be patched up on a box with GNU patch 2.5.9 (<a href="http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/gnu/alpha/gnu/diffutils/patch-2.5.9.tar.gz" target="_blank">http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirro...h-2.5.9.tar.gz</a> ) or later, and then moved to the target HP-UX box (installing and running GNU patch on the HP-UX box will work as well).<br />
        <br />
        For both IA and PA first perform the following steps:<br />

</pre><br />
        <br />
        Then, for <b>PA</b>:<br />

        </blockquote>Sorry to take so long to respond, I just noticed this recently. A friend loaned me some time on:<br />
        <br />
        HP-UX B.11.11 U 9000/893 HP-UX<br />
        aCC: HP ANSI C++ B3910B A.03.34<br />
        <br />
        As a small note, on this older compiler, I had to convert all the source<br />
        code from dos to unix line endings, otherwise it would fail on #define<br />
        multiline continuations.<br />
        <br />
        I'm providing a patch to nsis-2.29-src which works for both the above<br />
        host/compiler and:<br />
        <br />
        HP-UX B.11.23 U ia64<br />
        aCC: HP C/aC++ B3910B A.06.12 [Aug 17 2006]<br />
        <br />
        The only real difference from my original patch is that it adds -AA to<br />
        CXXFLAGS (its the default on aCC A.06.12) and fixes some compile errors<br />
        in Source/util.cpp (they were only warnings on aCC A.06.12).<br />
        <br />
        Clearly, the library locations will be different, but these should be<br />
        specified by the user anyway.<br />
        <br />
        I should explain that my patches are essentially to add alignment fixups based on SIGBUS. Either -lunalign or -lhppa provides this handler<br />
        as documented here:<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/porting/tru64-to-hpux/tru64-to-hpux.pdf" target="_blank">http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/porti...64-to-hpux.pdf</a><br />
        <br />
        As for Portante's patch, I haven't yet had the time to analyze or test<br />
        it, but if it converts makensis to using only aligned access, then this<br />
        is better and the alignment fixups I'm using are not needed, and should<br />
        be removed.

        <p class="post-content">I had more time than I thought this afternoon:<br />
        <br />
        I tried applying nsis-hpux.patch-patch.txt, and during the hpux ia64 build I get these:<br />
        <br />
        aCC: warning 967: Option -AA or -AP does not apply to ANSI C compilation, ignored.<br />
        <br />
        Without the alignment fixups from <a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/porting/tru64-to-hpux/tru64-to-hpux.pdf" target="_blank">http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/porti...64-to-hpux.pdf</a> the running of makensis still results in a bus error.<br />
        <br />
        But the 'anonymous' warnings are now gone :) so I'm going to add that patch to my build of nsis-2.29-src.<br />
        <br />
        Here are the only warnings left for me on hpux ia64:<br />

        <br />
        Note that I did not use +W829 (I think it just suppresses a compiler message for a certain compiler--not the version I'm using, since none of my warnings have that number)

        </blockquote>Ooops....didn't mean to let that slip through: '__THROWSPEC_NULL' should really be 'throw()' and '__THROWSPEC_X(__bad_alloc)' should really be 'throw(bad_alloc)'. The patch I submitted has that corrected, but not in any #ifdef, since it should just be standard for all compilers (but I haven't tested on msvc).<br />
        <br />
        The meaningful names I chose are: UName and UOffset, but these can easily be searched and replaced in the patch if they aren't good.<br />

        I've submitted patch<br />
        1758863 at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1758863&amp;group_id=22049&amp;atid=373087" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/tracker/inde...49&amp;atid=373087</a><br />
        <br />
        I developed this patch using free accounts from <a href="http://www.testdrive.hp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.testdrive.hp.com/</a> which I would like to recommend trying.<br />
        <br />
        It may help to understand why PATH may need to be specified (for instance, if you want to compile using GCC on HPUX, but you must build/install GCC in your home directory since you don't have administrator rights).<br />
        <br />
        Also, I think it may valuable to try some changes first hand if needed.
