      <p class="post-content"><strong>Localization of installer.</strong><br />
      I'm trying to provide translations for messags inside my installer. So far I've had good sucess mostly, but somehow I'm not referencing these correctly or something.<br />
      <br />
      Installer: <a href="http://wiki.worldwindcentral.com/World_Wind_Eta_Full_b1" target="_blank">http://wiki.worldwindcentral.com/World_Wind_Eta_Full_b1</a><br />
      <br />
      And my translations (which I put in a Global.nsh file included in the installer.)<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://wiki.worldwindcentral.com/Installer_Translations" target="_blank">http://wiki.worldwindcentral.com/Installer_Translations</a><br />
      <br />
      problem is when I save this file as ASCII, I lose the polish chars, and when I save as UTF-8 it crashes NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Using <a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, you can use:</p>
      <pre>
<code>f = codecs.open("utf.txt", "r", "utf-8")<br />t = f.read()<br />f.close()<br />t = t.lstrip(unicode(codecs.BOM_UTF8,"utf-8"))<br />f = open("1250.txt", w)<br />f.write(t.encode("CP1250"))<br />f.close()</code>
</pre>It's surely possible with many other tools too.

      <p class="post-content">If I encode in anything but ASCII the file does not compile. It causes an error in line one. If I save it as ASCII it seems to work, however I'm having a problem with the fact that it's always using the English translations (all other languages are ignored.)<br />
      <br />
      Sigh.. I'm also having problems with the line<br />
      <br />
      StrCpy $1 ".NET 1.1"$(Requirement1)<br />
      <br />
      It's empty every time :(<br />

      <p class="post-content">Not being able to compile a script is not crashing.<br />
      <br />
      Your StrCpy line has the quotes misplaced. Put the ending quote after the language string. The way you wrote it, $(Requirement1) specifies the maximum number of characters to copy from ".NET 1.1" into $1. Since it's a string with no numbers, it'll be translated to 0 and you'll always get an empty string.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ahh.. I had worked around the problem with two strCpy's<br />
      <br />
      strCpy $0 ".NET 1.1"<br />
      strCpy $1 $0$(Requirement1)<br />
      <br />
      I think your solution is more elegant though, I was unaware you could reference strings inside strings.<br />
      <br />
      Now the only problem I'm having is that the english is getting used regardless. :( For a test I feed all the defined strings into messagebox's and change the language, but no love.<br />
      <br />
      I'll update the wiki to the latest Installer I'm using. Perhaps someone here can figure it out..</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's because, eventhough $LANGUAGE is changed in .onInit, it only takes affect after .onInit. You can put the message itself in .onGUIInit. I'd even do the check before asking the user for a language. No sense in letting the user down after the hard work of selecting the language :)<br />
      <br />
      One problem with .onGUIInit is that it won't be called in silent mode. So you have to check for silent mode in .onInit and abort if it's on.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you kichik, your explanation and another thread about the same problem got it all solved. I now have multiple languages :) Just not quite sure what any of them say. hehe</p>
