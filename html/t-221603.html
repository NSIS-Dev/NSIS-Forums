      <p class="post-content">Or next example. Check which features of the installer were installed. If component (section) was installed and you didn't want install it again - use for this section "SectionSetInstTypes sec_id 1" (if there are only 2 insttypes - All, Automatic).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Probably it will be most easier to write function which set necessary components for Automatic type. And in function .onSelChange call it if this type has been chosen. But i think use of the SectionSetInstTypes not such complicated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">(in my previous post there was an "un-" for unnecessarily missing)<br>
      <br>
      the following problem appears when using SectionSetInstTypes:<br>
      <br>
      when the installer is launched everything is fine. when i select the "onInit" installtype, the correct sections are being shown. now, when i switch back to the installtype "all", the sections selected by SectionSetInstTypes are not selected anymore.<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>OutFile DynSection.exe<br><br>InstType "All"<br>InstType "Second only"<br>InstType "onInit"<br><br>Page Components<br>Page InstFiles<br><br>Section "1" First<br>SectionIn 1<br>DetailPrint "Section 1 was selected"<br>SectionEnd<br><br>Section "2" Second<br>SectionIn 1 2<br>DetailPrint "Section 2 was selected"<br>SectionEnd<br><br>Section "3" Third<br>SectionIn 1<br>DetailPrint "Section 3 was selected"<br>SectionEnd<br><br>Section "4" Fourth<br>SectionIn 1<br>DetailPrint "Section 3 was selected"<br>SectionEnd<br><br>Function .onInit<br>SectionSetInstTypes ${Third} "4"<br>SectionSetInstTypes ${Fourth} "4"<br>FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br>
      is this a bug or a feature (if so, what is its purpose)?

      <p class="post-content">That is because SectionSetInstTypes sets the install types for section with bits. For your install types max value may be 7 = 0111 (bitwise) - section is in all install types. Value 5 = 0101 (bitwise) - section is in "All" and "onInit" types. So value 4 indicate that section is only in "onInit" type (0100 bit).<br>
      This script works correctly (but i think not as it is necessary for you:D). Try to use SectionSetInstTypes ${Third} "5".</p>
