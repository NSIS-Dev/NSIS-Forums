Is there a possiblity that one of the following things could be added to the installer to make ExecWait a little cleaner:<br><br>* Hide the console window<br>* Minimize the console or place it behind the installer window<br>* Fire up a nice message box with a message that explains to the user what it is doing during the wait like "Starting MySQL Daemon ..."<br><br>Warm regards,<br><br>Brent<br><br>By the way, this issue has been brought up before with no results: <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=77705" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....threadid=77705</a></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th May 2002 18:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">What you can do is excute the program with Exec and not ExecWait and then find its window with FindWindow. Then you should call BringToFront to bring the installer back to front, show some install options dialog that says installing whatever or just printing it in the details, and finally enter into a loop waiting for the window to close (using FindWindow and waiting for it to return zero).<br><br>To just hide it you can create a shortcut for it and execute it with ExecWait.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bmatzelle1</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th May 2002 03:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I tried your solution but it still is unsatisfactory. To the user the console still flashes to screen before going to the background and the installer seems like it is frozen (to an ordinary user) while the command is running.

      <p class="post-content">If you want it just to hide use my code, if you want a more elegant solution use rainwater's solution.<br>
      BTW you won't have to create an extension for every console window, just one that will get the message to display and the command to run using the stack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No, it doesn't display anything. That's the whole point - it hides the command window. See Docs\nsExec and Examples\nsExec for more details on what it returns to the script.</p>
