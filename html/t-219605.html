      <p class="post-content"><strong>Easy generating vpatch information for many files.</strong><br />
      In my installer I have to patch several dozens of files. How to automate creating of pat files ? It's annoying write something like<br />
      GENPAT oldfile.txt newfile.txt patch.pat<br />
      for each file :(<br />
      I have new files ( &lt;filename&gt;.* ) and old ones (&lt;filename&gt;.bak ). How to process all the files to generate &lt;filename&gt;.pat files ?<br />
      Maybe some bat-file? I just don't know how to make it process all the files in the folder(s)<br />
      <br />
      Ideally, I want part of *nsi file generates automaticly :)<br />
      something like this:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        vpatch::vpatchfile "$INSTDIR\&lt;source dir&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.pat" "$INSTDIR\&lt;source dir&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.*" "$INSTDIR\&lt;source dir&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.*"
      </blockquote>where &lt;source dir&gt; is the name of folder ( without full path ) where file is situated.<br />
      Any suggestions ? Did anyone solve such a problem ?

      <p class="post-content">The easiest way is to create another NSIS installer which loops through all the files in a folder, and runs GENPAT on each one. It also writes to a seperate .nsi script vpatch lines which you !include in your main script.<br />
      The installer can be ran from the top of the main script with !execute or !system.<br />
      <br />
      Example of this method:<br />

      I made the following<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        Section "1"<br />
        ;SetAutoClose true<br />
        Setoverwrite on<br />
        SetoutPath "$INSTDIR\"<br />
        File "genpat.exe"<br />
        FindFirst $3 $2 "*.p3d"<br />
        loop3:<br />
        FindNext $3 $2<br />
        DetailPrint "File: $2"<br />
        execDos::exec 'GENPAT old/$2 $2 $2.pat'<br />
        IfErrors 0 loop3<br />
        SectionEnd
      </blockquote>It's worky and I have some ideas how to process all the subfolders ,but I have a question :<br />
      I need to run GENPAT only on files that has the old version in old folder. How to make a condition ?<br />
      And I still have a dream :) how to generate part of *.nsi ?

      <p class="post-content">In other words I have several folders of files. I need to update the same files in the destination folders and add new ones. My installer is some kind of a patch and there're will be new versions, so I want to automate the process...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes! I did it. It's much easier then I thought :)<br />
      When ther's no old file GENPAt simply pass it through without error. Now I can easily generate vpatch info I need:)<br />
      What about autogeneration ? Any ideas ? What plugin can I use ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">When you mean autogeneration, do you mean by executing the compiled exe everytime you compile the script?<br />
      If so, just use !execute.<br />
      <br />
      Your code will only work for files in a single folder. If you have files to patch in more subfolders, you can use Recursive Find:<br />

      <p class="post-content">I am looking at doing something very similar. However, I have a very large project, but only a few files are likely to have changed between versions. I have notice that if you run genpat on two identical files it will still generate a patch file (all be it a small one).<br />
      <br />
      Is there any easy way to find out if the files are identical before I call genpat. Or any way to test the results from genpat to see if the files were identical.<br />
      <br />
      I just don't want the patch package to try to patch loads of idenitical files, it will just waste time and space.<br />
      <br />
      I have tested the return value from genpat, but it returns zero in both cases. I have noticed it does show a warning message. I am going to see if a can capture the text output from getpat and search it for the warning message, but is in not very elegant. Any better ideas ???</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Kichik<br />
      <br />
      Yes I have tried nsisPatchGen but I have had some difficulties (I have yet to get it to work for me). Anyway I have written a NSIS script that does most of what I want.<br />
      <br />
      But to check is a file does require patching I am checking for a string message in the output from genpat, which is not very robust way to program, but I don't known of a better method.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again</p>
