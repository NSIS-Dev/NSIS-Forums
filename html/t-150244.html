      <p class="post-content"><strong>Feature request</strong><br />
      In the near future could someone put together a mulitiple one section script<br />
      <br />
      Say you had five sections with five boxes in each, but only one choice can be selected from each section, (it doesn't have to be five boxes, thats just an example) it could be upto how many you wanted.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry if this is in the wrong forum, but I'm not sure where the request forum is<br />
      <br />
      Thank you<br />
      <br />
      -Tony</p>

      <p class="post-content">well in the one section script, you have section required, with option 1, 2 and so on<br />
      <br />
      What I would like is something like this<br />
      Required<br />
      Option 1<br />
      Option 2<br />
      Option 3<br />
      Option 4<br />
      2nd Required<br />
      Option 1<br />
      Option 2<br />
      Option 3<br />
      Option 4<br />
      3rd Required<br />
      Option 1<br />
      Option 2<br />
      Option 3<br />
      Option 4<br />
      <br />
      So from each section you can you have 4 selectable options but you can only select one choice from each section</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh ok.<br />
      It is actually very easy to repeat parts of that script for even more component check boxes.<br />
      Maybe you could give it a try?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I did, but it kept screwing up, therefore my request for someone with a little more knowledge to upload a script which recreates the multi one section<br />
      <br />
      Thanks<br />
      <br />
      I managed to to do this together with pengyu's help but it's not right I don't feel<br />
      <br />
      it combines the one_section script and another (forgot name)<br />
      <br />
      but I could only get the other sections to work right with two options</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've got some free time, so I'll have a hack at it.<br />
      I did something very similar to what you requested back when one-section code was slightly different (well over a year ago now I think)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Took less than 10 mins.<br />
      I had to add 4 new variables, so make sure you check and then copy the code thoroughly.<br />
