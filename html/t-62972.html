I think, it would be very usefull for lot of people to be able to localize NSIS without the need to modify NSIS sources (i.e. just by instructions in NSIS script). For the first run (when I forget texts in details view that can be disabled by "ShowInstDetails nevershow"), it would be sufficient to allow the localization of ten (eleven) texts, mostly butons and the specification of the font (or font script: Western, Central European, Hebrew, Baltic, Greece etc.) for the background window.<br><br>Here are the hardcoded texts:<br><br>Buttons:<br>-------<br>I Agree<br>&lt; Back<br>Next &gt;<br>Cancel<br>Browse...<br>Install<br>Uninstall<br>Close<br>Show details - only because of current behaviour, see bellow<br><br>Other texts:<br>------------<br>Space required<br>Space available<br><br>Would it be usefull for other users?<br><br>By the way, "ShowInstDetails nevershow" is working only in Installer, not in Unisntaller - I can't get rid of "Show details" button in Uninstaller.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Repzilon</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th October 2001 11:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">At this time, translating NSIS needs to edit the source (which is, of course, easy to get).
