I'll talk to the creator of the plug-in about finding a solution for this, but in the mean while you can use this little plug-in I have just created (attached). Here's an example:<br>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks alot, the plugin worked wonderfully!!!!!. For anyone who has had the problem with updating files becouse they are in use or becouse the application was ran during your update, this is the best fix I have found. I would even reccomend that this be an option on the installer becouse it would help prevent install or update failures. Thanks again for the solution.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, seems pretty clear to me:<br>
      <br></p>

      <blockquote>
        A mutex object is a synchronization object whose state is set to signaled when it is not owned by any thread, and nonsignaled when it is owned. Only one thread at a time can own a mutex object, whose name comes from the fact that it is useful in coordinating mutually exclusive access to a shared resource. For example, to prevent two threads from writing to shared memory at the same time, each thread waits for ownership of a mutex object before executing the code that accesses the memory. After writing to the shared memory, the thread releases the mutex object.

      <p class="post-content">A mutex is a lock. It can be locked by one program so the other can't open it. In our case, your program creates a mutex and locks it. The installer tries to open this mutex, and if it sees that the mutex is locked it concludes that your program is running.<br>
      <br>
      Every mutex has an unique name, in the example above it's "myMutex".</p>

      Is it possible to find mutex names (if any) from all applications?<br>

      <p class="post-content">If the application has created a mutex it's possible. All you need to know is the name. Mutexes are global or at least global on the current session (in XP fast-switching or NT terminal services).<br>
      <br>
      Mutexes also have security attributes, so the application can deny you from opening the mutex. But you'll still be able to know the application is there because the mutex exists :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">So, say if the exe or game is called quake2, then the mutex will probably be called quake2 right?<br>

      <p class="post-content">No, that's not a sure thing. Wasn't Quake 2 originally a DOS game? It might not set a mutex at all. Open it using <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" target="_blank">Dependency Walker</a> and see if it calls CreateMutex (under kernel32.dll).</p>

      <p class="post-content">It seems to me that one would want to use this technique in both .onInit and un.onInit. For example, one's module might control a shared component, and a user might unknowingly think it's okay to uninstall one app using that component while installing another.<br>
      <br>
      But one can't actually use this technique for that purpose, because if you're doing an upgrade, you might have to run the uninstaller before placing the new files, which would mean 2 threads using the same mutex.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Have the uninstaller create the mutex only if a certain command-line switch was NOT present and have the upgrade installer launch the uninstaller with that switch, but the standard unsinstall shortcuts/entries should launch without the switch.<br>

        I think it should be "CreateMutexA(i 0, i 0, t "myMutex") i .r0 ?e".<br>
        See: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Allow_on...aller_instance" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Allow_on...aller_instance</a>
      </blockquote>This doesn't work for me either<br>
      <br>

      <blockquote>
        I don't think you should use GetLastError (?e) to determine the result of CreateMutex. Instead of i.r0 ?e on the end, just use .s. The rest of the code can stay the same as CreateMutex will return 0 (NULL) on failure.
      </blockquote>I used the following code to check out <b>.s</b>:<br>

      <blockquote>
        System::Call 'kernel32::CreateMutexA(i 0, i 0, t "myMutex") .s'
      </blockquote>But this time the CreateMutex results in nothing - not even a number. I tested it with MessageBox MB_OK $R0<br>

      <b>Edit: Ah! What I found out is that I'm using the UAC library and because of this the program seems to start twice at the first time - I printed out the message of the return value of createMutex and it appears twice! It may not relate to this topic.</b><br>

      <b>I'm going to ask my question in the related plugin topic, so if someone of you got an answer please answer in that topic</b>
