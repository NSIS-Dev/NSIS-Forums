There are many products and I have not found satisfying information on home pages so I would like to ask you for filling in the table (Word) I am sending you. The table contains functions the installer that we will choose should have. I hope the filling this table in will not take you much time. If your product is freeware I will still be more grateful. If your product is commercial I can ensure you that if we choose your product we will like to buy it.<br><br>Please excuse me if I have contacted you already.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Karel Maèl, firm CCA, Pilsen, Czech Republic</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th March 2005 15:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I looked at your list and read all your points...<br></p><blockquote>Operating system support (what it runs during packing)<br>?<br><br>Operating system support (what it runs during installation)<br>?<br><br>parameter installation (to ask user during installation, e.g. in what directory to install)<br>Yes<br><br>installation packing according to choice of appropriate configuration file (there will be one configuration file for each our product, that is possibility to create a set of configuration files and then only to choose according to which file the installation shall be made)<br>This should be possible<br><br>possibility of configuration file editation „by hand“ (e.g. in Notepad)<br>NSIS script language is pure text<br><br>limits (possible limits of installation volume, number of files, etc.) {our distribution has approximately hundreds MB}<br>2GB limit (due to Win 9x)<br><br>mask support (asterisk convention- when I want to copy e.g. files *.dll and I need not name them)<br>Yes<br><br>support of directory recursive processing (when I want e.g. to copy the directory APL and everything that the directory contains)<br>Yes<br><br>possibility to start external programs – e.g. sqlplus (synchronic (installation stops and waits for the completing of external programs) and asynchronic (it does not wait for completing of programs))<br>Yes; Exec, ExecShell, ExecWait, nsExec plugin etc<br><br>creation of user dialogues (these are various reports and communication)<br>Yes; InstallOptions plugin<br><br>possibility of different reaction of product installation according to some parameters (customer, installated version) – e.g. to install various files according to a customer code<br>Yes<br><br>possibility to delete files during installation (also files that are not part of installation – e.g. from the previous version of the product (application))<br>Yes<br><br>protocol creation of installation course (log file from installation)<br>Yes<br><br>protocol creation of distribution packing (report from distribution packing)<br>This will be possible, but you’d need to create some custom function to do it (on compile-time)<br><br>e-mail and Internet support (e.g. to send a log file from installation)<br>You can use FTPPlugin<br><br>installation dividing in more parts if installation is longer than medium type (CD, DVD, www; the fixed file length)<br>Would have to be done manually<br><br>file control during installation writing (if the older/ newer file name is the same, detection/possibility of reaction in the case of file locking (when the file is open), setting of file attributes, …)<br>Yes<br><br>summer/winter time support (possibility to ignore one hour difference between the files)<br>More info?<br><br>Possibility of install away (to return to the state before the installation was done when there is a installation mistake, that is to delete the result of installation, but to restore the original state)<br>No built-in support, but this is possible<br><br>Possibility to change the user interface (colours and logo of our firm)<br>Yes<br><br>support of long file names<br>Yes<br><br>support of Czech spelling in file and directory names<br>Not sure, but it should work<br><br>to fix big and small letters in file and directory names (we will be interested in it mainly during distribution of Java programs)<br>If you mean to convert file names to lower case, then yes<br><br>possibility to functional enlarge (existence of inner programming language?)<br>That’s the main feature of NSIS… It’s a programming language in its own right<br><br>native archive support (ability to pack/unpack common archives without external archive maker) – ARJ, RAR, CAB, ZIP, etc.<br>Not built in;

default behaviour<br><br>possibility to create self – unpacking file with suffix *.exe (secondary, primary e.g. setup.exe and packed data should be separately)<br>As default, files are packed inside the setup.exe, but if stored outside; again you’d have to use a command-line utility to decompress them</blockquote>-Stu</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
