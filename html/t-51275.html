Features I'm planning on adding:<br>- support for defining symbols and having &lt;symbol&gt; be replaced in the source file<br>- support for !undefine<br>- having a reboot flagging system, and a reboot instruction<br>- more options for uninstaller (including callbacks and silent mode)<br>- enumregkey/enumregvalue instructions (maybe).<br><br>I have some other things I've been thinking about, but I'm trying to weigh in which things I will do, and which ones I won't, because I don't want to bloat the exe header. Compiler improvements (like the !define features) will most definately get in, since they really don't cost anything.<br><br>A lot of people have been emailing me with their custom functions for doing things like checking whether or not the current user is the administrator, what version of windows/ie you are running, and what not. At this time none of these seem general enough to add to the installer directly -- you can do pretty much all of this just by looking at (and attempting to write to) the registry. If people want, I will make an official NSIS page with example functions to do these things. Send your contributions to justin@nullsoft.com. :)<br><br>-Justin<br><br>P.S. The NSIS page on nullsoft.com will now be no more than 24 hours behind the firehose.net address. Thanks, Tom. :)<br>P.P.S.

This makes the installer a lot bigger, but some people really need to get some user input.<br>Or maybe it should be a seperate app which takes user input and returns an ini file which NSIS can read - hint for someone?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">yazno</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st May 2001 19:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">hi,<br><br>i wrote some functions and uploaded them to the 'function archive' on my tripod account (s.
