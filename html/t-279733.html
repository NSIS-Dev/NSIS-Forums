      <p class="post-content"><strong>Unable to find not formatted drives with GetDrives</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I'm currently using the macro ${GetDrives} to find removables drives (type FDD), strictly speaking compact flash drives.<br />
      <br />
      This works fine as long as the compact flash disk is already formated. If it doesn't contain a valid file system ${GetDrives} will not find/display the drive.<br />
      <br />
      I call HPUSBF.EXE later in the installer to format the compact flash card and to make it bootable.<br />
      <br />
      Needless to say that Windows Explorer displays the drive letter and presents the dialog "Disk in drive has not been formatted. Format now?" when selecting the drive.<br />
      <br />
      Is there any way to find these types of drives with the ${GetDrives} macro?<br />
      Or do I have to call a .dll directly? (This will probably exceed my current NSIS knowledge)<br />
      <br />
      Somebody please point me in the right direction.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I guess GetDriveType, which is used internally by GetDrives, returns DRIVE_NO_ROOT_DIR and not DRIVE_REMOVABLE as FDD expects. A slight change to GetDrives to add the ability to get unmounted drives as well might solve this. But you might also get drives which are actually unmounted. I guess you'll have to go one level lower when it comes to drives being formatted or not.<br />
      <br />
      If you can write this using Win32 API, you can write a NSIS plug-in based on Examples\Plugin.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks kichik, but it's all my fault :o<br />
      <br />
      ${GetDrives} does what it's supposed to do and returns all requested drives.<br />
      But I totally forgot that I'm also using ${DriveSpace} to check the free space, and I only save drives with a total size greater than 100MB.<br />
      Naturally not formatted drives don't return any valid size information.<br />
      <br />
      After removing the size check everything works as expected.</p>
