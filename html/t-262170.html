      <p class="post-content"><strong>Copying a subset of files</strong><br />
      I've seen some posts that touch on this topic, but I haven't grocked exactly how to do it. Say I have a bunch of lang-specific files in my setup (added via File "blah blah").<br />
      <br />
      At runtime I want to detect I'm on a Spanish system and only copy Somefile.spa vs Somefile.jpn. How can I do that? I've seen reference to CopyFiles using $Exedir, but haven't managed to make it work.<br />
      <br />
      Is the general approach that you have to explode everything and *then* selectively delete vs selectively copy from the compressed file? I've looked around in the samples and haven't seen it (or don't know that I've seen it! ):)<br />
      <br />
      I'm from the MSI world where we'd simply put a condition on a feature/component. Does NSI have the same concept/functionality or does it always all files?<br />
      <br />
      Code snipped would rock if its anything other than CopyFiles/Delete.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers!</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could prompt users to select their desired lang. Take a look <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Common_Installation_with_Components_Choise" target="_blank">here</a> for a sample related script. Anyway you may examine the target system for local settings, windows version, user privileges, required runtimes etc, and set sections on/off. You have the option to pack your files within the installer or store them unpacked. Also you may download files at runtime execute them and continue your installation.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the hints! The direction I'm trying to go now is to have a section for each lang file ala:<br />
      <br />
      Section /o "Korean" kr<br />
      File "Foo\kr\Foo.exe"<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      Section /o "English" en<br />
      File "Foo\en\Foo.exe"<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      etc<br />
      <br />
      My main section will then turn on the section that matches the lang I detect as the system lang, or what they select. I try to do that via:<br />
      <br />
      SectionSetFlags $(LANG) ${SF_SELECTED}<br />
      <br />
      where LANG is en, kr, jp, etc<br />
      <br />
      This never appears to work. I always get a Copy Failed in the details pane.<br />
      <br />
      I've tried calling this SectionSetFlags from within my main section and via calling a function from the main section. I've tried hard coding values vs using these vars.<br />
      <br />
      I've put the lang section defs before and after the main section trying to catch any scope/defn issues. I'm not sure if there is any specific info I can gather from IfErrors other than there was an error vs getting detailed info (aka GetLastError()).<br />
      <br />
      I saw some posts suggesting using macros in LogicLib, but if that is included it chokes on LangString definitions saying it was expecting 3 vs 4 params.<br />
      <br />
      I'll keep playing with it and read more posts.<br />
      <br />
      It seems similar in logic to posts I've seen so maybe I'm doing something illegal by calling it within a section vs a function, or some sort of order issue, etc.<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas what might be up?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, I've tried calling SectionSetFlags ${en} ${SF_SELECTED} explicitly to test and still get the copy failed error. i.e.<br />
      <br />
      Function SetLanguageSection<br />
      SectionSetFlags ${en} ${SF_SELECTED}<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      which is called from my main section. Does it matter if I call SectionSetFlags from a function vs a section? Neither appear to work for me, so that maybe a moot point!<br />
      <br />
      Including LogicLib.nsh gives me LangString errors:<br />
      <br />
      LangString expects 3 parameters, got 4.<br />
      Usage: LangString [un.]name lang_id string<br />
      <br />
      They compile fine w/o that header, so not sure what is up there. I've tweaked the order of the includes. Same errors if LogicLib is there<br />
      <br />
      In theory if calling SectionSetFlags directly fails I've got a bigger problem than the LogicLib issue. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks! I've got it now. I think I was getting tripped up by trying to be clever (Read:lazy) and having a single line:<br />
      <br />
      SectionSetFlags ${LANGUAGE} 1<br />
      <br />
      where my section names mapped to the same string (in your example) as the LANGID numbers. For some reason that never worked out correctly.<br />
      <br />
      So something like:<br />
      <br />
      section /o "english" 1033<br />
      sectionin 1<br />
      sectionend<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      Pop $LANGUAGE<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      SectionSetFlags ${LANGUAGE} 1<br />
      <br />
      Maybe that can work and I've just got the syntax horked. I tried a few variations, but never hit it.<br />
      <br />
      If I do the long form where I StrCmp against all X versions like you did and set them explicitly it works.<br />
      <br />
      If you know why my previous all-in-one attempt fails that would be nice to know, but I'm good now and that is the important thing!<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again for the help!</p>

      <p class="post-content">The syntax for section is:<br />
      Section section_name section_id<br />
      The syntax to set flags is:<br />
      SectionSetFlags ${section_id} 'flag'<br />
      So, what is supposed to do the SectionSetFlags ${LANGUAGE} 1<br />
      Is there any section with id LANGUAGE?</p>

      <p class="post-content">My attempt is to create a variable that contains the section name (en, kr) and have the SectionSetFlags call use that var so I can have a single call.<br />
      <br />
      I must have had something else wrong earlier as now this appears to work. So something like (in pseudo code for brevity):<br />
      <br />
      if English<br />
      StrCpy $(lang) "en"<br />
      <br />
      if German<br />
      StrCpy $(lang) "de"<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      SectionSetFlags ${$(lang)} 1</p>
