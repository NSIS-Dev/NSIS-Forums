      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to start stop uninstall services BASED on IF services are started, stopped, etc?</strong><br />
      I need to communicate with services and communication is very dependent on the services current state. e.g. There is no point in trying to start a started service. No point in trying to stop a stopped service. No point in trying to uninstall a nonexistent service...<br />
      <br />
      I've been pulling my hair trying hard on this. I've download the services.dll by sunjammer I believe. I've downloaded the NSIS service lib and worked with that. Both choices are no go. Sunjammers solution works with MessageBoxes BUT how do I use that to my advantage? How do I say IF service is installed GOTO Is service running? IF service is running please stop it. IF service is installed but not running please uninstall.<br />
      <br />
      Man, I tried clear errors, IfErrors and a bunch of other stuff and cant quite get any thing to work. This is something I tried in so many different variations but give me no cigar :(</p>
      <pre>
<code>Section<br />  ClearErrors <br />  services::IsServiceRunning 'MyService'<br />  Pop $0<br />      IfErrors skip1<br />      DetailPrint "one sleeping... Stopping MyService"<br />      nsExec::ExecToLog '"C:\Program Files\rock\paper\scissor.exe" -stop'<br />      Sleep 9000<br />      skip1:<br /><br />  ClearErrors<br />  services::IsServiceInstalled 'MyService'<br />  Pop $0<br />      IfErrors skip2<br />      DetailPrint "one sleeping... Removing MyService"<br />      nsExec::ExecToLog '"C:\Program Files\rock\paper\scissor.exe" -remove'<br />      Sleep 9000<br />      skip2:<br />      <br />  ClearErrors <br />  services::IsServiceRunning 'MyService'<br />  Pop $0<br />      IfErrors 0 skip3<br />      DetailPrint "Second sleeping... Stopping MyService"<br />      nsExec::ExecToLog '"C:\Program Files\rock\paper\scissor.exe" -stop'<br />      Sleep 9000<br />      skip3:<br /><br />  ClearErrors<br />  services::IsServiceInstalled 'MyService'<br />  Pop $0<br />      IfErrors 0 skip4<br />      DetailPrint "Second sleeping... Removing MyService"<br />      nsExec::ExecToLog '"C:\Program Files\rock\paper\scissor.exe" -remove'<br />      Sleep 9000<br />      skip4:<br />SectionEnd</code>
</pre><br />
      Any body have any ideas? I much rather work with the plugin by sunjammer than work with the other script. I could in no way get the other script to work. I couldn't even get an error out of it :( Can someone please help. Thanks!

      I've solved it... I was going to sleep before posting that last message but I could never really sleep without solving a problem from the night before ;)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I promise to post my solution tomorrow for those looking on seeing about how I did it.</p>

      <pre>
<code>Section<br />  services::IsServiceRunning 'MyService'<br />     Pop $0<br />      StrCmp $0 Yes 0 no_MyService_running<br />      DetailPrint "Preparing to Stop MyService"<br />       nsExec::ExecToLog '"C:\Program Files\rock\paper\scissor.exe" -stop'<br />        Goto MyService_running_done<br />        <br />no_MyService_running:<br />  DetailPrint "HOORAY!!! Skipped an unstarted service (MyService);)"<br />   Goto MyService_running_done<br />MyService_running_done:<br /><br />  services::IsServiceInstalled 'MyService'<br />     Pop $0<br />      StrCmp $0 Yes 0 no_MyService_installed<br />      DetailPrint "Preparing to Uninstall MyService"<br />       nsExec::ExecToLog '"C:\Program Files\rock\paper\scissor.exe" -remove'<br />        Goto MyService_installed_done<br />        <br />no_MyService_installed:<br />  DetailPrint "HOORAY!!!
