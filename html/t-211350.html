All links now redirect to their respective pages on wiki, so old links will still work correctly on older threads. The wiki has advantages like accepting the editions from anyone (which can be restricted depending on case), and also having a simpler page sintax. Another reason: contrary to Archive, it is updated as the MediaWiki software is updated, so bugs will be lesser harmful and features can be implemented more easily.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">deguix</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd June 2005 22:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>I noticed that user's profile pages don't have a list of contributions like the old Archive.
