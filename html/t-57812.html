      This example would have two panes that would show up, one with three questions and the next with two. The placement could be standard, with the questions on top of the textbox or selection. I believe textbox and selection should be the minimum since free form text and specific answers to questions are usually needed.

      <p class="post-content">I want the programmer to have the option for the main NSIS window to close when it is complete. It doesn't look good if the user needs to click on "close" in order to receive a notice that installation is complete. (if this feature is already implemented, please, HOW DO I USE IT?)<br>
      <br>
      Also, I want the ability to use .png files for a splash screen, taking full advantage of the alpha channel. One could have a round, anti-aliased splash screen that blends perfectly with whatever is behind it.<br>
      <br>
      Here are some minor suggestions:<br>
      1. Ability to change the NullSoft Install System text.<br>
      2. Why does it automatically append "Setup" to the end of the titlebar? I don't like this!<br>
      <br>
      3. Ability to change the titlebar of a popup dialog.<br>
      4. Ability to specify the installer/uninstaller icons.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And finally, I have a few questions:<br>
      1. How do I allow the user to choose what to install? (Full, Compact, Recommended, Custom)<br>
      <br>
      2. How do I auto-close the main window when installation is finished? And is there a way I can prompt the user to reboot the system?</p>

      <blockquote>
        1) An option to automatically check for a previous installation on a new installation and that will run the uninstaller before the new installation.
      </blockquote>Already possible. In the .onInit check to see if a key in the registry exists, if it does then you know that there has been a previous installation. Then run the uninstall for that version with ExecWait and then continue with the install.<br>
      <br>

      <blockquote>
        3) Ability to autoclose the uninstaller program so that you don't have to click on close to exit. This is sort of tied into the first one since you end up with the uninstallers sitting on top of the current installer without closing in the current situation.
      </blockquote>Pretty sure this can be done already.<br>
      <br>
      Angry Weasel:<br>
      Most of your questions could be answered by going through the documentation or examples that come with NSIS. Anyways try:<br>
      1. Use 'BrandingText'<br>
      4. Use 'Icon'<br>
      Set AutoCloseWindow to True to automagically close the installer upon completion.<br>
      Have a look at SectionIn re: Full/compact/custom Install types<br>
      <br>
      Me? I'd like additional callbacks added for each page like Felfert's patch allows (or, in my case, doesn't..)

      yay this is a very good idea, but can please somebody explain me what exactly is the alpa channel?<br>
      <br>
      some idea: this is maybe stupid, but however. What if will be the installer splitted in multiple files. e.g. if you have installer that has 4MB and you need to put it on 3 floppy disks... do you know what i mean? (`coz my english is not good:D) you compile the installer with some new magic directive /split_into_4_files... compiler generates "install.exe, install.e00, install.e01, ..." you insert first disk run installer and after short while "pip..." please insert disk two atc... did you get that? bye bye, trace ;)</p>

      </blockquote>An Alpha Channel is a part of a image file (Gif or PNG) that controls transparency. While gifs only have 1 Alpha channel (Pixels can only be There, or Not There, [100%, or 0%]) PNG's are allowed multiple channels. Pixels can be 50% Transparent, 25% transparent, 100%, 0%, anything. Basically, Alpha is Transparency.<br>
      <br>
      As for the suggestion, it's kinda like a .rar file, right? Like, it'll split each part into a 1.4meg file, instead of 15meg files.<br>
      <br>
      Sounds nifty.

      </blockquote>Small correction: Both Gifs and PNGs have only one alpha channel. The difference between the alpha channels is, that the alpha channel of gif is 1 bit large (visible or not, like a mask) while the alpha channel of a png image is several bits large (8 I think). Imagine it as a greyscale image where white is visible and black invisible and the grey colours are partial visible.

      <p class="post-content">GIFs don't support an alpha channel at all. They added the ability to specify that a particular color in the image should be rendered transparent. Although very similar, it features the drawback that you lose one color from the final image. In a format that only supports 256 color images to begin with, it becomes a more important issue.<br>
      <br>
      Splitting an installer across multiple files would be nice, but are there really that many people distributing software on floppy anymore? A CD costs less that one floppy, much less 10 of them. I guess that if your install is several hundred megabytes then I could see the use, especially if you plan to offer web download. CDs are cheap, and even having it made professionally doesn't cost much compared to floppies.<br>
      <br>
      Along the lines of the above mentioned large installs, I would like to see something similar to make dependancies. To only recompile items which have been modified since the last compile. (do you know how long it takes to build a 600 MB install with compression enabled) Perhaps a way to isolate the files in each Section and then only recompile the section which has modified files.<br>
      <br>
      I would like to see the ability to add a graphic to the main install window. If this is across the top (like Windows Installer) or down the side doesn't matter much.<br>
      <br>
      Callback functions for additional items like when the user selects/deselects a section. This would have to have the ability to programatically select/deselect sections also.<br>
      <br>
      And pizza. It definately needs to be able to cook pizza.<br>

        1. Ability to add/remove components when rerunning setup. On the first page of the setup wizard you should have the following options: add/remove components, repair and uninstall.
      </blockquote>You can easily do it by adding an InstallOptions screen on startup that asks you what would you like to do and then make the installer act according to the selection.<br>
      <br>
      BTW, my wish is that NSIS or InstallOptions will have support for images.

      Try NSIS BrandImage. The only version is 1.59, but you could do some code hacking. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32998&amp;release_id=59178" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/project/show...lease_id=59178</a> (it is hosted by the NSIS Project House .. Admin(s): Koen van de Sante and me :))<br>

      <p class="post-content">i want visible required sections (ok nobody else needs this)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      some of the wishes are already implemented (in 1.91)<br>
      <br>
      so thats not the problem<br>
      <br>
      branding images would be fine<br>
      and a new component page (treeview) like in the ms office installer for big installers so that u can group your files<br>
      <br>
      and an option if u select one section that requires another (strange i know but would be fine) then the other should select itselfs automaticly<br>
      <br>
      something like<br>
      <br>
      if (a&lt;b) {<br>
      <br>
      }</p>
