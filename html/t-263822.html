      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to code a page with "minimal" and "full" install options</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hi, I'm trying to create an app that has a custom page with two options (icons?); "minimal install" and "full install" - similar to a Microsoft Office type of installation. Depending on which the user selects, I'd like to call the appropriate code. Can anyone give me a brief explanantion of how to do this - I've tried searching but aren't really sure what I'm looking for!. Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">I guess by that you mean that you don't wish to show a components page that it may be customized to show only minimal and full install types, right?<br />
      Did you already set up the custom page or we're talking start from scratch?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi, yes, that's correct - so when the app starts it would go to this "selection page". Once I knew what type of install they require I can then present pages that will have different type questions. For example the "full" one will have some more text fields that will contain paths to progs only available in the full release.<br />
      <br />
      I've not set any custom pages up yet as I'm still trying to plan/workout exactly what I need to do!</p>

      <p class="post-content">briefly,<br />
      you'd need to get your self familiar with InstallOptions by examining the included examples up to the point that you'd be able to design a custom page and add the desired controls.<br />
      mainly you'd need 2 grouped radio buttons one for full install and the other for minimal.<br />
      also, you need to define your sections as optional with /o switch. in custom page's leave function you're getting user's choice and accordingly you're enabling sections with SectionSetFlag.</p>

      <p class="post-content">stop that.<br />
      <br />
      there's a faaaaaaare more easy way than this.<br />
      <br />
      use the normal components page and use "InstType" settings.<br />
      <br />
      for every section you can set:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
InstType "Full"
<br />&gt;InstType "Minimal"
<br /><br />&gt;Section test testid
<br />SectionIn 1 #section is in installtype Full only
<br />&gt;SectionEnd
<br /><br />Section test2 testid2
<br />SectionIn 1 2 #section is in installtype Full and Minimal
<br />&gt;SectionEnd 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>you also can use sections without using SectionIn, they then can only be selected in "Custom" InstType (which is always predefined, see NSIS doc, chapter <b>4.8.1.24 InstType</b>.

      </blockquote>I assume this is addressed to me right?<br />
      Stop what?<br />
      What exactly is bothering you and I'm supposed to stop it?<br />
      What is your problem anyway, unless you were blind you would seen above that I've already asked drod why not a components page.<br />
      Sorry if when I post it bothers you, I'm not posting on threads that you have opened, I'd never do I promise, but I can't do something beyond this because I intend to keep posting, so you'd have to deal with your problem!

      </blockquote>Regarding to my self, I like to "waste" my time keep trying with NSIS, and I also like to share this "time wasting" with others, but only when they have request this share, so you'd better avoid reading my posts if you wish to save your time.<br />
      Last and least. When I'm able, I like to welcome new users who asking for help related to NSIS, by the mean to show them, how great, and far beyond a typical installation system, stands this incredible scriptable system.<br />
      That's all.

      <p class="post-content">i do too, but i also always try to find just any solution.<br />
      <br />
      so the first that comes to my mind will be taken, except it will probably take more time to implement it than to think about a more simple one.<br />
      <br />
      and yes, i often just overfly your posts, but this is what i do with all forum posts, if i do not need the exact knowledge at the moment and just a hint what all is about.</p>

      Maiden castle?? absolutely no idea.<br />

      <p class="post-content">@demiller9 thanks for the help with english,<br />
      defeat is wrong expression? should I change it? I do not mean conquer, I mean something like 'try to deal with'...<br />
      Maiden castle = unbeatable castle, also wrong?<br />
      <br />
      edit:<br />
      done, removed until i find the correct expressions, often I use a dictionary to translate my expressions, seems the translation is not successful all the time, or my expressions are too complicated to be translated correctly :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">@Red Wine - We're getting off topic here, but...<br />
      I think (after your last post) perhaps the 'maiden castle' might be an 'invincible fortress'? I don't recall the exact signature now, so its hard to say how to improve it.<br />
      <br />
      I realize English isn't the native language for everyone, and I thank everyone for making the effort to use it.<br />
