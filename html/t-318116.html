User want's to click the next button, my application path wants to set for the Mingw. I need to do this mingw installation as silent installation with out user interference.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2010 15:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well according to notes on AppDeploy, MingW uses NSIS. However, their installer has not been written properly and /S will not work (it appears to download files normally but they've probably done this in page callbacks - oops!) However the notes on AppDeploy are from 2008 so things may have changed since. Try running the installer with /S and see how it goes. If that works, you can use the /D switch as well (see NSIS manual for installer command line options) and you can use ExecWait.<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
