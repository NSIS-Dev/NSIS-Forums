      <p class="post-content">I don't think you can actually directly do what you want- i.e., open a web page and wait for the user to close it before continuing. Since the browser is not a console process, I don't think that any of the NSIS exec functions can wait for it.<br>
      You might want to use FindWindow to find the browser window and then sleep &amp; loop until is is closed.<br>
      Or maybe create a plug-in DLL similar to InstallOptions which lets you embed the web page into the installer window?<br>
      ExecWait needs you to provide an executable. Just providing the URL is not enough. And even if you provided the path to the browser exe, it probably won't work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">2 other options to think about would be to simply add a MessageBox after the WebPage call, that says something like "Click OK to continue the install". Or you could check out a cool program called AutoIt (<a href="http://www.hiddensoft.com/AutoIt" target="_blank">http://www.hiddensoft.com/AutoIt</a>), which has very good wait/logic commands. Hope this helps.<br>

      Both suggestions in the previous posts seem to work. (although I've only briefly checked the 2nd with WinXp-Sp2 ... makes me wonder about other/earlier o/s such as Win98 and with other browsers)<br>

      Not bad :D<br>

      Somewhere, I've got a whole "suite" of old NetScape browsers, and will maybe check them. But I suppose that would involve changing the default browser setting.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This even works with Win95 Gold - last version without IE. Was tested with a full set of browsers for <a href="http://www.imageplayer.net" target="_blank">http://www.imageplayer.net</a> (few years ago). NS 4.7 specifics not touches this situation.<br>
      Might be a bit better to check HKCR .html file type in registry first, but this is optional, because type is htmlfile :)</p>
