      <p class="post-content">yeah, I just wish that thingie be more usable.<br />
      <br />
      I tried twice and still need more time to understand what's going on with that modern UI.<br />
      <br />
      Too complex compared to normal GUI, IMO.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Did you try the latest version of the Modern UI?<br />
      <br />
      The latest version is really easy to use. You only have to insert a few lines of code and everything is set.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the modernUI much more confusing than the original UI, but they have made it a little easier with the more recent releases. There is a lot less code to put in now.<br />
      <br />
      I think its more confusing because it forces you to declare variables, insert macros and "include" things. I never had to learn that with the old interface.<br />
      <br />
      One Question, I grabbed the CVS version today and noticed 2 things:<br />
      <br />
      1] BrandingText doesn't seem to be changing the text<br />
      <br />
      2] in the output screen of makensisw.exe (after you compile), both "Test Installer" and "Tools" use "T" as the "Alt-" character. If you hit Alt-T it does "Test Installer".<br />
      <br />
      *edit* I did some testing with BrandingText and it changes it ONLY if its after the line that reads: !insertmacro MUI_SYSTEM<br />
      <br />
      If its before that then it doesn't change it. Maybe I'm missing a variable somewhere? I tried reading the Readme.html for it, but nothing...</p>

      </blockquote>Alt+T should now do Tools. It will be in the next snapshot.

      </blockquote>Have a better look at the Readme :D<br />
      <br />
      Before you insert MUI_SYSTEM: !define MUI_BRANDINGTEXT "Some text"
