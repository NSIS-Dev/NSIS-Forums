I still have some questions and maybe smbd can answer them:<br><br>1) I read that it can do: give to the tool a bunch of files for instance: myapp.exe, setup.exe (installer intelligence), myapp.dll, etc and those can be packed together on a Linux system and it will generate a Windows binary that when run on Windows will run the file setup.exe packed inside.<br>Is the above correct?<br><br>2) Is NSIS able to provide updates in a pacth format? Meaning apply just a diff to the files?<br><br>3) What happens if an update needs to be applied and some files are in use?<br><br>4) Can I somehow force an "always overwrite" flag for the files to be installed? I mean if the files are found in the destination directory to be always overwritten by the ones from the package?<br><br>5) Can I get 2 different builds:<br>- one, where everything is compressed into one .exe file, including myapp files<br>- one that is not compressed, meaning I get the setup.exe containing the installer inteligence and the other files like myapp files outside from the installer exe<br><br>6) Is there a wizard that I could use to generate a basic installer? Or do I have to manually write from the scratch a script file?<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Vivi</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st January 2006 18:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Yes, you can create Windows installers on Linux using NSIS.</li><li>Yes, see Docs\VPatch.</li><li>You can use the Library macros to handle updating of in-use DLLs.

As it seems NSIS meets by basic requirements, I'll start playing with it a little.<br><br>One more question: I read that the silent feature is by default in. I assume it doesn't show any dialog and uses the default values for everything in the script. Still is there a way an admin (that needs to deply the sw in a company) to overwrite those default settings that were decided in the first place by the developer?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Viv</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2006 11:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can have your installer read an INI file (ReadINIStr) in silent mode (use IfSilent to check it it's silent or not) and use the values from it to overwrite your defaults.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
