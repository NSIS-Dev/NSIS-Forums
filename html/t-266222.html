      When is NSIS going to have logging built in to the main compiler with enable/disable switches built in?<br />
      <br />
      Last I heard, it wasn't in the main version because it made the installers larger. I tested it our real quick, and the 12 installs I have been created, the difference has been extremely slim (around 4k).<br />
      <br />
      Since memory and bandwidth are much easier to come by that years previous, perhaps we could think about merging these logging changes into the main branch.<br />
      <br />
      Great product -- I love it!<br />

      <p class="post-content">The majority of people do not need logging support and those that do need it can simply download the special build at:<br />

      <p class="post-content">The problem I ran into, is when I share my scripts I have to tell them to download the "Special Build", because the scripts are not compatible. It just sounds kind of goofy (no offense) having two separate executables, and there seems to be no reason for it to be so. Since logging is a neccessity to understand when things go wrong, it seems like a likely thing to be in the initial version. I just don't understand why there is the insistence of maintaining two completely different images.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I have brought up suggestions for improvements in the past, and the responses I always get seem to be that I am doing it wrong, try it this other way, rather than to enhance the product and make it easier to use. For some of the text on the site that seems to indicate this forum is for suggestions, they seem to go pretty well ignored.<br />
      <br />
      So, I do appreciate the help very much so, and I appreciate all of the help this forum has provided (it has been really awesome), but if you ask for user feedback as this forum does, I get confused when the responses I get are explaining why things are the way they are. I think it will make a better product if some of these recommendations actually get implemented.<br />
      <br />
      This in in no way intended to be a slam to this product or this forum, so please think of it as more positive feedback.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can test for the NSIS_CONFIG_LOG define to make your script build on both vanilla makensis and the special build with logging enabled.<br />
      <br />
      As for suggestion being ignored. Well, logging specifically is not something I wish to add by default. No matter how wider bandwidths become and no matter how faster and larger storage grows, being small still has its benefits. And yes, one of them is hype.<br />
      <br />
      As for every other suggestion being ignored, that's of course a bit of an exaggeration. There are suggestion that get discarded for whatever reasons but a lot of them do get into NSIS eventually. There's of course a limit to what just the developers can do. Sadly, patch numbers aren't too encouraging.</p>
