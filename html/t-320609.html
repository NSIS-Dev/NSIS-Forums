It does not create a temporary copy of the files to patch, and modifies the original file directly. This means the final user don't need extra free disk space, only the final file size is required.</li><li><u>Fast and Precise mode</u>:<br>When enabled, for each files to patch, instead of scanning the whole patch database for the file signature, it will locate immediately a specific patch information (by offset). File signature is still verified to prevent patching a wrong version of the file. This mode also allows to patch two identical source files into different target files.</li><li><u>Support for huge files</u>:<br>By default, a MD5 hash of the whole file is calculated as the file signature to verify that the file is really in the patch database. This can lead to a significant slowdown for huge files. For those, you can choose to only use the first &amp; last 64K of the file as the signature. In this case, make sure that the beginning or end of the file contains data that are unique/specific for each patch (typically, I recommend placing a timestamp updated for each version of the huge file)</li></ul>WPatch has been widely tested and performance improved in a real production environment.<br><br>Using the WPatch system is as simple as calling: <i>(for example)</i><br><pre>
<code>WGenPatDir.exe --precise --exclude *.tmp;.svn dir1 dir2</code>
</pre>to establish the difference between dir1 and dir2 (your "old" and "new" version of your program's directory), and, in your NSIS installer script:<br><pre>
<code>
Section
<br>    InitPluginsDir
<br>    ;...
<br>    ; $INSTDIR points to the directory dir1 that is going to be transformed into dir2
<br>SectionEnd
<br>&gt;!include WGenPatDir.nsh
<br>Section
<br>    IfErrors 0+2
<br>        MessageBox MB_OK "There has been some errors !"
<br>    ;...
<br>&gt;SectionEnd 
<br>&gt;
</code>

      </blockquote>mmmh i'm not sure.. maybe it supports patching files that are up to 4 GB, you will have to test... (and tell me ^^)<br>
      I'm lazy about reviewing my code for this limit.. however it has been tested perfectly with 1.85 GB files..<br>
      <br>
      Of course, we are talking about a *patching system* here, so this assumes the 4 GB file to be patched is already installed on the target system... (which can be difficult to achieve with NSIS in the first place)

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br>
      <br>
      This seems like the closest thing to what I'm looking to achieve. We are looking at moving NSIS installer at the moment in the company I work for and for one of our projects, we need to compare two xml files for user settings and if a line is missing from one then add it to the other file.<br>
      <br>
      I'm not sure if its possible to do this with your plugin? Essentially they should have the same tags as the core files but if the XML values in the files are different, I don't want to overwrite them, I just want to add any new tags I'm adding to the software in the new release.<br>
      <br>
      I hope that makes sense and that you can let me know if your plugin is suitable for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for your help.</p>

      </blockquote>No, this cannot be done with a binary differ, as they are designed to encompass all changes at once. What you want to do can be done entirely in native NSIS code, using FileRead, StrCpy and StrCmp (or LogicLib). Something like:<br>
      <br>
      FileRead file1_line<br>
      FileRead file2_line<br>
      (some macro here to trim strings down to only the tag - maybe look for = character, or whatever)<br>
      if file1_tag != file2_tag<br>
      copy file1_tag to file2<br>
      (maybe add some default value to file2)<br>
      endif<br>
      loop.

      <p class="post-content">You seem to be looking for a 3-way merge = Take the difference between 2 files and incorporate those differences into a 3rd file, even if it contains other changes.<br>
      <br>
      There are a few tools that can perform this... Typically <b>diff3</b> from Unix...<br>
      For Windows, you may use something like <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
      <br>
      Or maybe, first establish a "text diff" file, and apply it to patch the 3rd file. For example, use <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm" target="_blank">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">Be careful, those 3-way merge have their limits, they cannot always work if they can't find where to insert the difference (if the files have changed too much around the lines to modify)..<br>
      Maybe, another solution for you could be to merge the differences more manually, by manipulating directly the XML data in the target file, for example using the <a href="http://wiz0u.free.fr/prog/nsisXML" target="_blank">nsisXML plug-in</a>.</p>
