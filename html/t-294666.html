      <p class="post-content"><strong>Set registry user rights</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      my first post :)<br />
      <br />
      I want to know whether there is a possibility to set the user rights for an entry in the registry.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Background info:</b><br />
      <br />
      I made an entry with WriteRegStr.<br />
      When a user with Main-User rights logs in to WIN XP he has only rights to read the entry but not full access.<br />
      When I log in as admin I have all rights.<br />
      <br />
      The software has to read the entry later but can do this only when the rights are fully setted. I do not know why this is like that because usually the right to read should be suffice.<br />
      <br />
      I tried to use MULTIUSER_INIT macros.<br />
      The installer asks for whether to install the software for all users or not but the rights are still the same in the registry..<br />
      <br />
      I hope someone can help me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You shouldn't do this for security reasons. But if you really want to, you can use the AccessControl plug-in from the Wiki.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This seems to be a problem in the way that your program (not the installer) is reading from the registry. This is a common problem that is very easy to do accidentally. I would check to see what permission flags are being used to read the registry values.<br />
      <br />
      Especially with the way that Vista handles security now, you probably should check your program out as this will be even more of a problem for you as more and more people adopt Vista. And, to change the permissions of the registry during an installation is probably not playing nice with a user's machine, IMOHO.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, thank you for your answer. I think the bug is in the software. I will search for it.</p>
