      <p class="post-content">I think having a "Web Install" option would be 'gnarly'<br />
      <br />
      Instead of packaging all the files into 1 exe why not download an installer (like Netscape's setup) that transfers the necessary files from the web?<br />
      <br />
      Maybe even have the option to store a text file on a specified server and have the installer download that file first.. this file would contain the filenames (and locations) of what to download.<br />
      This way people would use the installer as an updater too.<br />
      <br />
      Excuse me if I come across as confusing. I am a bit drunk at the moment. =)</p>

      I also was thinking about such feature. I think it is a good idea.<br />

      And it's probably a lot of work (you'd need to include a complete downloader).<br />
      Do you want such a complex (and error-prone) feature?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Not now, for the future</strong><br />
      First let Justin make NSIS a good (not to degrade the installer, it is already damn good) "normal" installer and after that add the web-feature, if there is enough demand for it.<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Good for VB</strong><br />
      I think it would be great for VB applications that would need runtimes/ocx's/etc. This way, you could have one installer download and then when the user installs it, if they need any of the required files, they can download them.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Re: Good for VB</strong><br />
      I don't like internet installs because they depend on the reliability of the server at all times. Nobody can mirror your files if the install script always looks in the same place - and what if you change web hosts? Ugh.<br />
      <br /></p>
