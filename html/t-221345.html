      <p class="post-content"><strong>execWait problem</strong><br />
      I have searched through the help and forums but to no avail! My problem is getting a .bat file to run using execwait. I write the bat file during the install and it appears correctly in the install routine, it also works if I double click on it.<br />
      The install says it is running it but it never does. I have tried ExecWait '"$INSTDIR\PDMIntegrator\PDMi_build_mm.bat"'<br />
      and even tried<br />
      ExecWait "c:\temp\PDMi_build_mm.bat"<br />
      the file is alway there, it just never executes. I have used a message box to confirm the path but I just cannot seem to see what is wrong.<br />
      Help!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tried nsExec::Exec?<br />
      <br />
      Edit: Also make sure you set the working folder correctly before running the batch file using SetOutPath.<br />
      You shouldn't really need to use a batch though - everything that can be done through a batch file can be done through NSIS script too.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the reply, I had tried nsExec as well, which make me think something must be fundamentally wrong. My code is:-<br />
      CreateDirectory "$INSTDIR\PDMIntegrator"<br />
      SetOutPath "$INSTDIR\PDMIntegrator"<br />
      call writeBuildBatchFile<br />
      ; ExecWait '"$INSTDIR\PDMIntegrator\PDMi_build_mm.bat"'<br />
      ; ExecWait "PDMi_build_mm.bat"<br />
      nsExec::Exec '"PDMi_build_mm.bat"'<br />
      As you can see I have 3 options, none of which work. I appreciate the comments about the batch file, it is slightly unusual in that it is running a custom routine that already exists on the target system. Are there any install logs I can view?<br />
      I have also tried using the IfFileExists command before running my execWait, and it tells me the file is there.<br />
      I downloaded nsi yesterday if that helps. My batch file is below, I don't know whether the syntax is wrong in this?<br />
      echo hello &gt; c:\temp\test.txt<br />
      rem PDMi_build_mm.bat verion 13.20<br />
      cd /d "C:\Program Files\CoCreate\OneSpace Manager 2005\clntwin"<br />
      call mmbuild.bat</p>

      <p class="post-content">This works on my comp (XP Pro SP2), see attachment.<br />
      nsExec or my execDos would be better, of course.<br />
      SetOutPath creates folder if it not exists yet.<br />
      I used File command instead of dynamic file creation ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Thanks!</strong><br />
      Takhir, Thanks very much for the example scripts, they helped me focus on what was the problem. I have not used execWait before and spent all my time looking for a problem with the syntax of the command, which you proved to be correct.<br />
      It turns out my routine to write the batch file did not have a fileClose statement!<br />
      Once again many thanks, the quality and speed of your response was excellent!</p>
