To download files, there's NSISdl and InetLoad.<br><br>If it's the other kind of network, then the options are a bit more limited. SMS and GPO make it easy to push an installer packaged with MSI to an entire network. As far as I know, they don't allow pushing executables. You can always <a href="http://users.cyberone.com.au/dbareis/makemsi.htm" target="_blank">wrap</a> your executable installer in a MSI or execute it in the start-up script, but it's not the same.<br><br>Part of the problem is that there's no standard way for an installer to register itself as installed. MSI packages and even components, I believe, are listed in a registry. This way, the GPO/SMS server can know which packages are missing and push only those.<br><br>Maybe there's some program available that can be run in the start-up script that'll use a bit more standardized installers in order to create the same effect. Unfortunately, I've never heard of one.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mgillespie</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st March 2006 22:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I think they mean deploying to many desktops from a central admin command.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">stb</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd March 2006 10:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I'm interested in this topic, too.

I think this is great and I of course I allow silent installations (making proper decisions in .onInit or other steps). This makes NSIS corporate-network-able in general as an sysadmin can build some autoexec or logon script etc.<br><br>But this is not the same as MSI. MSI's can be deployed easily in a corporate network using some (Microsoft) Tools and I guess it is widely used in big networks. And probably adding some manual (batch-mode) deployment method is not all admin's favorite (some might not be able to do this). So building MSI packages would give all NSIS-based products a better chance to get installed on corporate networks.<br><br>I don't want NSIS to create MSI packages like all other MSI creation software does. NSIS should remain script based (that's why I use NSIS). But it would be great to have some kind of workaround to package real NSIS installers (.exe) into some MSI wrapper.<br><br>If anyone interested (I hope) please let discuss possibilities.

Somewhat limited, but it works for my purposes.
