Is this possible ?<br><br>Workaround for this is ofcourse saving the snetcfg to the INSTDIR but for the time being i dont think thats what i want (also, i dont know yet about the possible licensing issues)<br><br>Also, if anyone have pointers on installing network protocols via other methods (the protocol drivers &amp; inf files are done allready), i could use them since im basicly a linux coder and was introduced to this project And windows programming only 2 weeks ago =)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th January 2006 18:08 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">It's possible.
