      <p class="post-content"><strong>Change BG color for NSISDL download file static control</strong><br />
      I am trying to change the color for all my dialogs into white. The only thing I could not do was to change the background color for the static control text in the NSISDL download component (downloading file speed ... etc etc).<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone have an idea how such a thing can be done?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was looking at NSISdl source and I found that this control doesn't have an ID, so you can't use GetDlgItem to paint the control. (this means, the control can only be accessed by the plugin itself)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks deguix, this is what I am trying to do now: in file nsisdl.cpp, function download, after these lines<br />
      // set initial text<br />
      char *p = filename;<br />
      while (*p) p++;<br />
      while (*p != '\\' &amp;&amp; p != filename) p = CharPrev(filename, p);<br />
      wsprintf(buf, szDownloading, p != filename ? p + 1 : p);<br />
      SetDlgItemText(childwnd, 1006, buf);<br />
      SetWindowText(g_hwndStatic, szConnecting);<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I added the following lines<br />
      <br />
      HDC hdcStatic = GetDC(g_hwndStatic);<br />
      SetBkMode(hdcStatic, OPAQUE);<br />
      SetBkColor(hdcStatic, RGB(255,255,255)); // i want it changed to white<br />
      LOGBRUSH lh;<br />
      lh.lbColor = RGB(255,255,255);<br />
      lh.lbStyle = BS_SOLID;<br />
      CreateBrushIndirect(&amp;lh);<br />
      <br />
      Still it doesn't work :(<br />
      <br />
      Duz anyone have any idea what am I doing wrong?</p>

      You don't need to get the DC, the DC is in the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC from ParentWndProc message ...</p>

      <p class="post-content">The recommended solution would be:<br />
      <br />
      - Adding a new control to 106 dialog resource.<br />
      - Making the plugin to use this control instead of creating a new one.<br />
      <br />
      This would allow NSIS to use this control.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why not re-compile nsisdl and assign an ID? These way can be used with GetDlgItem from NSIS.<br />

      Another recommendation :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Lobo Lunar, deguix and Anders<br />
      <br />
      I can not use FindWindow because the control is not created until I make the NSISDL:download command. Placing the findwindow before or after the statement would be useless.<br />
      <br />
      Also assigning an ID would not do the trick for the same reason.<br />
      <br />
      The suggestion by deguix seems the only viable choice, but I was hoping to find something a bit less complicated, maybe plant a few statements inside the NSISdl code. All I need to do is turn the background color into white, and I don't mind hard coding the color there ;)<br />
      <br />
      In any case, Thank you for all your replies, I appreciate you taking the time to answer :)<br />
      <br />
      Still, I wonder if someone can come up with any other ideas. If someone does please do not hold back :)</p>

      <blockquote>
        Also assigning an ID would not do the trick for the same reason.
      </blockquote>Now I'll explain simply:<br />
      <br />
      1)Open an UI with Resource Hacker.<br />
      <br />
      2)Go to dialog 106.<br />
      <br />
      3)Create a new static control with an unique ID. Also, position it where you want it to be. Remove the flag "WS_VISIBLE" so it will be hidden initially. The recommended position is:<br />
      <br />
      x1 = 0<br />
      <br />
      x2 = wndRect.right (266 for Default UI, 300 for Modern UI)<br />
      <br />
      y1 = wndRect.bottom / 2 + (ctlRect.bottom - ctlRect.top) / 2 (70 for Default UI w/ 10 for control height, 75 for Modern UI w/ 10 for control height)<br />
      <br />
      y2 = y1 + (ctlRect.bottom - ctlRect.top) (80 for Default UI w/ 10 for control height, 85 for Modern UI w/ 10 for control height)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      4)Save and exit the program.<br />
      <br />
      5)Open a program to edit "nsisdl.cpp"<br />
      <br />
      6)Search for "HWND hwndS = GetDlgItem(childwnd, 1006);".<br />
      <br />
      7)Add this code below that line you found:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code>HWND s = g_hwndStatic = GetDlgItem(childwnd, YourUniqueID);</code>
</pre>So it can recognize that the control is located in a resource. (Replace "YourUniqueID" with the ID of the control you added)<br />
      <br />
      8)Search for the line "hwndB = NULL;"<br />
      <br />
      9)Add this code below that line you found:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code>        if (IsWindowVisible(g_hwndStatic))<br />          ShowWindow(g_hwndStatic, SW_SHOWNA);<br />        else<br />          s = g_hwndStatic = NULL;</code>
</pre>This enables the control to show when the user calls NSISdl::download function.<br />
      <br />
      And also enables you to remove this control from the resource so the details won't appear anymore.<br />
      <br />
      10)Then search for "HWND s = g_hwndStatic = CreateWindow"<br />
      <br />
      11)Delete entirely the CreateWindow function. We don't want to create a control that already exists...<br />
      <br />
      12)Search for "if (hwndL)"<br />
      <br />
      13)Below "}", add this piece of code:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code>      if (g_hwndStatic)<br />      {<br />        ShowWindow(hwndL, SW_HIDE);<br />        s = g_hwndStatic = NULL;<br />      }</code>
</pre>So it will hide the control after the user clicked "cancel".<br />
      <br />
      14)Search for "DestroyWindow(g_hwndStatic);"<br />
      <br />
      15)Remove this code:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code>      if (g_hwndStatic)<br />      {<br />        DestroyWindow(g_hwndStatic);<br />        g_hwndStatic = NULL;<br />      }</code>
</pre>We don't need to destroy the control, as the plugin didn't create it.<br />
      <br />
      16) Compile and test it for errors.<br />
      <br />
      17) Color the control on sections or functions derived of sections as you normally would.
