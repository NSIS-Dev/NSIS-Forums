      <p class="post-content"><strong>Must select at least one Component?</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hello all.<br />
      <br />
      My installer has 3 sections, I think I would like to make sure the user selects at least 1 of them. Is there a way I can prevent them from continuing past the components page if no component was selected? Thanks all.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mirakulix, I checked out the one-section.nsi, and it looks like that would allow me to ensure ONLY 1 component could be selected. I would like to ensure that AT LEAST 1 component is selected before leaving the components page. Did I miss something in the one-section.nsi? Thanks for your help.<br />
      <br />
      p.s. I think what would be great would be to have the next button grayed out until at least one component is selected.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mirakulix, thanks! Its working very well. I try to never put any code into my script without fully understanding it, and I have to be honest, Iâ€™m still very new at the NSIS, but learning fast I hope. Could you explain the significance of "!define SF_SELECTED 1" ? I looked in the documentation, but it seems it only relates to silent installs. :igor: Thanks again!</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can safely replace the ${SF_SELECTED} with 1, but you can (should) not omit masking out the lowest bit.<br />
      SectionGetFlags returns an integer of<br />
      which only the lowest bit specifies if the section is selected.<br />
      You can only omit the masking if you are absolutely sure that no other options (Bold font, subsection, read-only) are turned on for these sections.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mirakulix, so what you saying is that it is safer to include the "!define SF_SELECTED 1" line, correct? Ok, no problem, I can add that back. I'm using the MUI, so should this line be up at the top, say in the ;MUI Settings area? Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you replace all occurrences of ${SF_SELECTED} with 1s, you don't need to !define ${SF_SELECTED} because this constant is not appearing in your code at all.<br />
      And if you don't use any other constants or macros from Sections.nsh, you need not to !include Sections.nsh</p>

      <p class="post-content">Can the One or more Sections script be changed so it only allows one of three components but also allows for none to be installed. As it is now one is selected all the time, all of them can't be unchecked.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mirakulix, all Afrow was saying was that the !define command sets the ${SF_SELECTED} variable to be '1' at compile time, not at runtime. Which is correct.</p>
