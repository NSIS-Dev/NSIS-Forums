      <p class="post-content"><strong>Select remote MS Cluster disk resources</strong><br />
      I want to star this thread because I have a particular issue I'm (beginning to) address on one of my installers. Allow me to explain my situation-<br />
      <br />
      I have an installer that must install from a remote pc/server to a MSSQL cluster and check/create folders on the SQL cluster disks.<br />
      <br />
      For those who may not know, cluster disks are not regular disks as they are shared storage and appear as 'resources' to the cluster, so on a simple cluster you have two server nodes, each with a 'local' disk of C: and a 'shared' cluster disk resource, we'll say 'R:'. The R: drive only appears on the active node of the cluster at any given point in time.<br />
      <br />
      We'll keep it simple and say my SQL cluster has only one shared disk (R:)<br />
      <br />
      So, when i run my installer remotely on another server or PC, I am able to verify and confirm the SQL server name/named instance so I am sure I have the active node server name and the instance name where the disk(s) are that I am looking for. What i then need to do is prompt the user for a valid local (to the cluster) disk and path to check and/or create a folder structure.<br />
      For example:<br />
      <br />
      SQL Cluster is running on 2-node setup servernames 'Windows1' and 'Windows2'<br />
      SQL Cluster name is 'SQL1'<br />
      SQL shared disk is 'R:' &lt;-- this is the only disk SQL can see<br />
      <br />
      Installer is run on PC 'Foo1', prompts for server/instance name and validates server = 'Windows1' and instancename 'SQL1'.<br />
      <br />
      I now want to ask the user where they would like to place the target folder; this will have to end up looking like a local path to the MS cluster e.g. : 'R:\Folder1\Folder2\'<br />
      -- This is the sticking point. How can I intuitively prompt for this information?<br />
      <br />
      I see a 'sloppy' way to handle this using UNC pathing, where i can check for '\\SQLClusterName\R$\Folder1\Folder2\' but I was hoping I could figure out a way to present a folders dialog that would allow the user to select\create a folder path based on the cluster disk resources, so instead of a local enumaration of C:\ it would give me the disk resources R:\ in the dialog. I don't have a problem attempting to create the folders using UNC but I don't have any clean way to present a dialog to my user to select the path they want to create/target.<br />
      <br />
      I'm looking for any feedback and assistance from the community on this puzzle; your help is very much appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks !</p>

      <p class="post-content">Are you saying you can't get R:\ but can get the UNC path? That aside, what is wrong with another MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY or a custom page using nsDialogs?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sorry for taking so long to follow up, but no - what I am talking about is a remote install, essentially.<br />
      <br />
      I can't be sure that where the installer runs will be able to see the cluster disks locally, so I need another way to enumerate them remotely using the cluster network name.<br />
      <br />
      "Node1" and "Node2" are part of a two node cluster.<br />
      The cluster has a network identity of CLUSERVER<br />
      SQL is installed on the cluster.<br />
      SQL has a cluster network identity of SQLCLUS<br />
      SQLCLUS has a disk resource assigned to it, the R: drive.<br />
      The way this works in clustering is that only the Node (1 or 2, never both) where the SQL instance is running will have the R: drive showing.<br />
      <br />
      Because of this, i cannot reliably look for drives on Node1 or Node2, but rather I must look through SQLCLUS.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      How can i enumerate the available disks on a remote server if I have the name "SQLCLUS" ?</p>
