      <p class="post-content"><strong>custom File function</strong><br />
      i'm having a problem over-writing certain files that are in use upon updating my software. the script ensures that all running applications and services are stopped, but certain dlls are not always unloaded in a timely fashion.<br />
      <br />
      i solved this in the uninstall by writing a custom delete file macro that attempted to delete the file for a specified duration before giving up. it essentially checks for errors and keeps trying again until the timeout has been reached or the file has been successfully deleted.<br />
      <br />
      i want to do the same thing for file copying because the problem is essentially the same: dll files are still in use and cannot be over-written. but i cannot write a custom File copying function because of the dual nature of the File instruction. i want to pass it a run-time variable but a compile-time constant.<br />
      <br />
      does anyone know how i could do this without having ugly cluttered code around each File instruction?</p>

      <p class="post-content">meh. i just put a timeout loop around the whole copy files section so it keeps retrying if there are errors until it times out.<br />
      <br />
      when i have time i'll try your suggestion for individual files.<br />
      <br />
      thanks.</p>
