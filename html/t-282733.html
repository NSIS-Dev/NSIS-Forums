      <p class="post-content"><strong>loading files from internet</strong><br />
      Ok I'm still fairly new to the NSIS installer, just looking for some help with scripting. Basically I want to download an inventory text file which has a list of further files to download. The theory is we can then simply update the inventory file on the server and not have to redeploy the setup.<br />
      <br />
      The inventory file contains a file list in the following format:<br />
      <br />
      filename1.jpg=images^filename2.jpg=images^data.xml=data<br />
      <br />
      so that we have filename followed by the folder it should go into seperated by ^ characters.<br />
      <br />
      The above would end up looking like this on the system:<br />
      <br />
      images<br />
      |-filename1.jpg<br />
      |-filename2.jpg<br />
      <br />
      data<br />
      |-data.xml<br />
      <br />
      If that makes sense. I would be really helpful if someone could help me out with an example script. From what I have read it looks like it should be possible I am just struggling with the scripting a little.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe you could use <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InetLoad_plug-in" target="_blank">InetLoad plug-in</a> to download your "inventory file".<br />
      Then you will parse it, for examle using FileRead instruction. Look into Appendix E in documentation for advanced parsing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't suppose anyone could help with an example of how to parse the file as explained above? Help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Talking about a plain text file, you should use the FileRead instruction as already mentioned.<br />
      Nevertheless you have several options, e.g an .ini which you may read with ReadINIStr instruction or a .cfg which you may read with ConfigRead.<br />
      Exclusively the file could be an xml which you may manage with one of the available xml plugins.<br />
      There are several examples for every case, you should search the forum and of course review the documentation.</p>
