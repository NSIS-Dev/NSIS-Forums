      hope you like them.<br />
      oh, and i also accidently saved them to somewhere elso :)<br />
      also the icons were 8 bit colored, that is unecessary IMHO, also for the installer icons...<br />
      if you like i also do some 16x16 icons for the installer too -&gt; win-install.ico<br />

      <p class="post-content">i have taken a look through my downloads and saw wise installers and installshields with a rip off of the 32x32 version of this icons, but slightly modified. these setups don't include 16x16 versions. why? because that they when they created their windows 95 version of the installer they hadn't the knowledge of integrating the 16x16 icon in their setup. please, don't use your own icon because it was missing in these rip offs (hm, is it the right way of writing that?), why not go back to the root and take the modified version of the original ms logo i made. i don't say that i don't like your icon, but in my eyes (the setup icon is also used in newest directx version) these two doesn't fit right together. why not create a 32x32 version for your 16x16 icon? i really like the 16x16 version you made, but they don't fit together.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The 32x32 is not a very generic classic installer icon, many companies use this one.<br />
      <br />
      Because MS created this ugly 16x16 icon with a lot of objects on a small space, that does not mean we should copy it. I think the current icons fit perfectly together (same style).<br />
      <br />
      MS guideline:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        If combining multiple objects into one image in an icon, consider how the image will scale to smaller sizes. We suggest that you use no more than three objects in an icon. <b>For the 16 × 16 size, you can also consider removing objects or simplifying the image to improve recognition.</b>

      <p class="post-content">It's quite difficult to recognize that icon. It's even more difficult than the MS icon above, because you have added another object.<br />
      <br />
      You can offer alternative icons on an archive page, but I'm not going to add tons of icons with small modifications to the distribution.</p>

      <p class="post-content">also, i don't want to start a fight about the icons on the board, but maybe it's just cause you haven't said "thank you" or whatever for my uninstaller icon in any way. also i don't want to force my icons to nsis, i wouldn't have created them when your previous post from 09-30-2003 05:41 PM which hasn't clearly said that you wanted to make the icon on your own until you edited it, but this time i already wrote my post with modified icons, so i haven't seen the updated post. so i hope you can understand why i started to post updated setup icons.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sorry, I think you understood me wrong. :) Hey, I'm not trying to start a fight or anything like that :D<br />
      <br />
      I was just trying to say that I what to limit the amount of included icons. Previously there were a lot of low-quality icons in the distribution, so I want to keep only a set of high-quality icons.<br />
      <br />
      The main set of icons are the new modern ones, created by a professional designer. For the people who want something different or want it to be as small as possible, some other icons will also be provided.<br />
      <br />
      I don't think this icon is the current "official" setup icon. I also don't want to copy any existing icons, there should just be a set of nice NSIS icons.<br />
      <br />
      Trying to put everything in the 16x16 icons makes it difficult to recognize. Icons should be as simple as possible. That's why I think it's better to only use the computer image on the small icon.<br />
      <br />
      If you have missed a "thank you", here it is :) Of couse I really appreaciate any contributions.</p>

      Anyway, I understand that you want to limit the number of icons, but this icon matches the header "win.bmp" which is included. Also this icon is high resolution.<br />
