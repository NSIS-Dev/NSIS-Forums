I'm trying to allocate a small amount of memory, but for some reason it won't in the script I wrote. I tried the System.nsi sample script and it worked fine! As far as I can tell, I'm not really doing anything different, however I keep getting 0 back as the result.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">LoRd_MuldeR</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th August 2008 18:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Possible reasons are: The system is out of memory or the remaining memory is too much fragmented (that is: there is no continuous block of free memory of the requested size). Both sounds very unlikely in your case, because you say that you are requesting only a "small amount" of memory. So I guess you are doing something wrong. But it's hard to say without seeing your code...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">blockcipher</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th August 2008 21:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Heh, yeah, that would help if I could post it. It's for a project at work, so I can't do that.<br><br>As for running out of memory, yeah, that's not happening. I tried this on a machine with 13Gb free and I'm only trying to allocate 4 bytes, which is the size of the value I'm trying to put into the buffer.<br><br>I do figure I'm doing something wrong, however I can't for the life of me figure it out. Every example I found revealed nothing of use. I mainly posted to see if anyone know of any sort of stack size limit/heap size limit/config setting/other that may have an affect on whether or not memory can be allocated.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">LoRd_MuldeR</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th August 2008 22:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well, I tried this, just like the example:<br><br></p><pre>
<code>OutFile "TestAlloc.exe"<br><br>Section<br>  System::Alloc 4<br>  Pop $0<br>  DetailPrint "4 bytes allocated at $0"<br>  System::Free $0<br>SectionEnd</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      And the result seems to work fine:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>4 bytes allocated at 2247232<br>Completed</code>

      Something else must go wrong in your installer...
