I want the program to be added to Window's auto start so that when the machine boots/reboots, the program is running. I was initially thinking that $SMSTARTUP was the solution I'm looking for but that seems not to work on my windows 7 development machine.. is that because the structure/location for start menu apps changed after XP?<br><br>If anyone could please help me understand this or point me in the right direction of the documentation that I need, I would be grateful. Any insight into whatever I'm missing would be much appreciated.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th July 2011 21:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">SHCTX\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br><br>You could have tried googling for 'run at startup'...</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
