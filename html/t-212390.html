      <p class="post-content"><strong>Application upgrade installs</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I currently have an application which has been released as version 1.0 and have an upgrade coming soon. I was wondering how to best go about this.<br />
      <br />
      Firstly I know I can simply set the right overwrite options when copying the files and it checks the existing file(s) versions and then decides whether to update or not. I have also seen previous posts on the forums which explain how I can change the installer to show "Upgrade" text if it detects and existing install and how to not write another entry in "Add/Remove Programs" if it already has been<br />
      installed.<br />
      <br />
      What I also need to do is to make changes to the database which the application uses. So if a previous version has been installed I need to drop some columns, create new tables etc. in the existing database.<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions as to how I can best go about this?<br />
      <br />
      Should I simply execute an Upgrade.exe program (which I write) at the end of the install and let it do the work?<br />
      <br />
      Can I run a command line program (which I write) and execute it as part of the setup?<br />
      <br />
      Or, if version 1.0 is detected as having been already installed, I install an upgrade.exe file in the application's directory. Let the install end as normal, and just have code in my application.exe which looks for this upgrade.exe and runs it?<br />
      <br />
      Any tips, suggestions as to how other go about doing a database upgrade to an existing installed application would be greatly appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers,<br />
      Diego</p>
