      <p class="post-content"><strong>AccessControl plug-in causes crash</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      after I added the following line to my Install section<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>AccessControlW</code><span style="color: #007700">::</span><span style="color: #0000BB">GrantOnFile</span><span style="color: #DD0000">"$APPDATA\@CPACK_NSIS_PACKAGE_NAME_LC@""(BU)""FullAccess"
</span>
</pre>the installer crashes reproducibly.<br />
      <br />
      I read the wiki page (<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/AccessControl_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/AccessControl_plug-in</a>), googled and searched the forum but I couldn't find any reason.<br />
      <br />
      Is there something "special" I have to pay attention to?<br />
      <br />
      I am on a Windows 7 Ultimate 32Bit system.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for any help,<br />
      Gunther

      </blockquote>Yes, we do (I am sure you recognized the 'W' and it was no mistake of mine ;))<br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Oh, oh ..., that's no good. :cry:<br />
      I badly need this functionality ... :(<br />
      <br />
      Do you know any other way how to set "FullAccess" rights for all users on a directory (that's "all" I need)?<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, now it seems to work without causing the installer to crash.<br />
      <br />
      Like after any file system command/ operation I added a Sleep command. And additionally I changed the permissions setting from "FullAccess" only to "GenericRead + GenericExecute + GenericWrite + Delete + FullAccess".<br />
      <br />
      I cannot say exactly why it now seems to work, but it does.<br />
      <br />
      It is the second time I noticed that NSIS is not working as expected if there is a file system command/ operation immediately followed by another command that bears upon the previous one (first time it was the RMDir command).<br />
      <br />
      So maybe this is a general "NSIS design" problem. And I guess that the file system operating speed differs from system to system. IMHO there should be a "mechanism" in NSIS that asures that the script is not continuing before the file system operation is completed (or raise an error if it couldn't be processed).<br />
      <br />
      As a programmer it is quite impossible to take things into account that depends on the respective user system.<br />
      <br />
      Currently one's code could be totally correct but does not work as expected =&gt; NSIS problem.<br />
      <br />
      Or am I wrong, overlook something etc.?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I know this is a year old but just in case anyone comes across this problem...<br />
      <br />
      The real cause of this problem is that you can't use (BU) in Windows 7, you have to use the SID "(S-1-5-32-545)" instead. See <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Talk:AccessControl_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Talk:AccessControl_plug-in</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, I'm not understanding the correction. (I do appreciate you posting a followup solution, but don't understand it).<br />
      <br />
      Are you saying that using the SID "S-1-5-32-545" instead of "(BU)" cures a problem that Netsurfer24 thought needed a Sleep to fix? Can you explain how that works?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It may be UAC. Even with full access on an ACL you may still not be able to write to some files depending on their location.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Actually its huge a script. What I suspects is that just after extracting some files I put the ReplaceText plugin code to replace text. So may be before file existence installer code tries to edit it.<br />
      <br />
      Now I moved the ReplaceText code after all files get extracted and so far no crash on that machine.<br />
      <br />
      And Im sure that this ReplaceText was the root for the crash cause every time installing it was getting crash on that section where ReplaceText was done.</p>
