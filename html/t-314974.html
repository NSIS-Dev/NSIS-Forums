Note: the exe is not an installer, I use it to launch my application.<br><br>Before I get flamed to death, I do realise this question has been asked before, and the solution to everyone else's problem seems to use RequestExecutionLevel but that doesn't seem to work.<br><br>Here is an example of my problem:<br><br></p><pre>
<code>
Name "Tester"
<br>&gt;Caption "Tester"
<br>&gt;OutFile "tester.exe"
<br>&gt;RequestExecutionLevel highest
<br><br>SilentInstall silent
<br>AutoCloseWindow true
<br>ShowInstDetails nevershow
<br><br>Section ""
<br><br> MessageBox MB_OK "Hello World!"
<br><br>  Quit
<br>  
<br>SectionEnd 
<br>&gt;
</code>
</pre>I have also tried RequestExecutionLevel admin &amp; user but problem remains.<br>
      <br>
      Any ideas?<br>
      <br>
      Many thanks

      <p class="post-content">I compiled your sample using NSIS 2.45 and ran it on my Vista system from a standard account ... and did NOT get the "program may not have been installed correctly" message.<br>
      <br>
      The same thing happened when I ran it from an administrator account.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for trying pengyou. I'm running it on Win7 with UAC enabled (set to default level) and get this message with or without the "RequestExecutionLevel highest" line.<br>
      <br>
      I've just tried it on a Vista machine (setup a new user account with UAC) and I do not get the message with the "RequestExecutionLevel highest" line included, but when I remove it I DO get the message.<br>
      <br>
      So this would seem to imply that the line fixes it on Vista, but not on Win7... Oh dear.<br>
      <br>
      Can anyone else with Win7 give this try? If this is a problem with NSIS/Win7 then it's something we're all going to have to contend with sooner or later.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Are you using NSIS 2.45? If you are using an earlier release then you'll have problems with Windows 7 because earlier releases of NSIS do not use the new manifest format that Windows 7 requires. If Windows 7 does not find the right manifest then you'll get that kind of message when you run your "installer".<br>
      <br>
      Edit: I tried running tester.exe (compiled using NSIS 2.45) on Windows 7 RC from a standard account and from an administrator account and did not get any "did not install correctly" messages</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ah ha! I've upgraded to 2.45 and you're absolutely right.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks very much for your help - problem solved :-)</p>
