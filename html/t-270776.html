      <p class="post-content"><strong>advice on automatic program upgrades</strong><br />
      Since automatic version checks and upgrades are now quite common (and expected), I also would like like to provide automatic upgrades for our program (the software that needs to be automatically upgraded is quite large (16MB) but pretty vanilla otherwise.)<br />
      <br />
      What is the best strategy for providing such upgrades? I guess uninstall and then reinstall is the easiest but our program is quite large and creates many local files for the user that should be reused in the new version.<br />
      <br />
      I guess the patches need to be digitally signed (authenticode?) but how can you verify that the signature is correct (openssl?)?<br />
      <br />
      Also, how do you avoid installers that require sequential patch installations (say we end up having 10 versions, and a user has version#1, do we need to force the user to upgrade to version#2 and then to #3, etc.) If we provide direct upgrade from version#n to version#m, that's a lot of patches to manage.<br />
      <br />
      Then there is the issue of checking if there is a new version.<br />
      <br />
      Then there is the issue of upgrading the module that does automatic program upgrades.<br />
      <br />
      I was 100% sure that there was a cookie cutter solution for this problem but couldnt come up with a relevant link let alone finding a solution within NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      Your advice/experience about this issue will be very welcome.</p>

      I wrote <a href="http://swupdata.sf.net" target="_blank">SwUpdata</a> in NSIS, which is now a dead project (due to the complexity of using ASM like code.)<br />
