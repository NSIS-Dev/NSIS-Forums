      <p class="post-content"><strong>LangString problem</strong><br />
      I've got a problem using LangString:<br />
      <br />
      1. define a variable using LangString for language LANG1<br />
      2. start the installer and choose LANG2 using MUI<br />
      3. strings show in System language, not the LANG2, the one chosed on startup (fortunately, it was LANG1).<br />
      4. when tried on a computer that has a different default language (LANG3), the strings were empty.<br />
      <br />
      Note that there were no strings defined for LANG3.<br />
      <br />
      It is terribly annoying seeing that, after choosing a language on the startup of the installer, the LangStrings show in the system's language.<br />
      <br />
      What happens if the strings for a language (doesn't matter the way the language is checked) are not defined - running the installer on a system with LANG3, LANG3 chosen on startup, but no LangStrings defined for LANG3.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the script is quite big.<br />
      here's a small script that has the same problem<br />
      <br />
      --- SCRIPT ---<br />
      !include "MUI.nsh"<br />
      <br />
      Name "testLangString"<br />
      OutFile "testLangString.exe"<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "English"<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "Polish"<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "Romanian"<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_LANGDLL<br />
      <br />
      LangString VAR1 ${LANG_POLISH} "POLISH is set"<br />
      LangString VAR1 ${LANG_ENGLISH} "ENGLISH is set"<br />
      <br />
      Section dummy<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      Function .onInit<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK $(VAR1)<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      --- END SCRIPT ---<br />
      <br />
      Questions:<br />
      1. My system is set to English. When I choose Polish, I see the English message. Shouldn't I see the Polish one?<br />
      2. Shouldn't there be a default language when I choose "Romanian" for example? I'd like to see English by default for example.<br />
      As a side effect to 1, if the system has a language that does not have a corresponding LangString, the variable won't contain any of the strings, it would be null.<br />
      If I don't have a default lang for langstrings, I have to use preinitialized variables and that change WHEN the langstring variable is not null.</p>

      </blockquote>Hmm.. I have message boxes in .onInit that need translation (warning for multiple installer sessions, close specific application and so on).<br />
      Ok.. assuming I move *all* the code from onInit, which is the next function which is called (before showing any PAGEs) that has the language strings enabled?<br />

      StrCpy ${VAR1} "text" ? or<br />
      StrCpy $(VAR1) "text" ? or.. some other method?<br />
      <br />
      P.S.:<br />
      (1) &amp; (2) should be documented.. somewhere. (I don't think I've missed something about LangStrings in the docs).

      <br />
      If your first page is "page license", use "PAGE license FunctionNameHere" to defined that page, before "License" page show, NSIS will call Function "FunctionNameHere" first.<br />
      <br />
      And you could put your warning or something inside Function "FunctionNameHere".</p>

      <p class="post-content">You should set a language string for all langauge, you haven't got one for Romanian.<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK.. so, here's how I fixed my script:<br />
      <br />
      I wanted to add some languages to the installer (NSIS default language tables) although I didn't have LangStrings for all, and I got to the next situation:<br />
      <br />
      StrCpy $LSTR_CURRENTUSER "Current User"<br />
      StrCmp $(STR_CURRENTUSER) "" +2<br />
      StrCpy $LSTR_CURRENTUSER $(STR_CURRENTUSER)<br />
      <br />
      So, in this case, I replaced the use of $(STR_CURRENTUSER) with $LSTR_CURRENTUSER. It isn't really elegant, it isn't elegant at all since I have 16 localized strings (for now).<br />
      <br />
      How could I write a macro that does those comparisons?<br />
      I gave it a shot, but it seems I don't handle properly all the variables sent as params. I'd like it to be something like<br />
      !insertmacro INIT_STRING $VARIABE $(LANG_STRING) $OTHER_STRING<br />
      ; the macro would basically assign to VARIABLE the value of LANG_STRING if it's not null or OTHER_STRING otherwise<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way to call the value of $(STR_CURRENTUSER) for a specific language, something like $(STR_CURRENTUSER[$LANG_ID])? (sugestion)<br />
      It would be a lot easier for me to call the previous macro like:<br />
      !insertmacro INIT_STRING $LSTR_VAR1 $(VAR1) $(VAR1[$LANG_ENGLISH])<br />
      <br />
      10x for your help<br />
      <br />
      p.s. i'll look into moving the code to .onGuiInit</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice idea. 10x<br />
      I understood how to solve the problem with the initialization of the strings, but I still need to find a fast way of assigning some strings to empty langstring variables. The reason for this is that I want to include with my installer more (NSIS default) languages and, at the same time, use the localized installer strings for some of them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Comment: The NSIS default installer strings looked great (in case you have changed the default lang file, please undo - it looked great before - or... it might look great now too, but... does it change in any way what charset I use for modifying own LangStrings?).<br />

      The LangStrings I define appear in the wrong way and I can't alter(define) the charset - I don't even know what charset is.<br />
      <br />
      My problem shortly: what charset should I use for the Macedonian LangStrings so that display correctly, just like the NSIS translation?<br />
      <br />
      Is the charset different for each language? If yes, where are the charset assignments for each language defined?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm.. the problem is that, using the latest nightly build, my installer looks horrible. The text is converted to RightToLeft, no language is auto-detected on start (the dropdown is empty, it had English autoselected before).<br />

      <p class="post-content">My mistake. Still testing. I'll have some feedback regarding the latest changes in the translation shortly.<br />
      <br />
      It seems that the compiler does not work properly (the output executable is corrupted - segfaults, no default language selected etc.) when an AntiVirus monitor is running in background - maybe a warning could be put somewhere to prevent this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Found a strange behaviour when loading languages.<br />
      I have to mention that I used NSISrc2 with the new Macedonian language updates.<br />
      <br />
      This is part of my installer script:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        !insertmacro UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD "English"<br />
        !insertmacro UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD "Dutch"<br />
        !insertmacro UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD "Macedonian"<br />
        <br />
        ; !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "French"<br />
        !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "SimpChinese"
      </blockquote>If I leave it as you see it, the installer crashes when it loads (Windows displays that dialog containing "Would you like to Debug....").<br />
      <br />
      If I uncomment French, it works ok. I don't know why. Maybe the language files have something in them that does not work properly.<br />
      <br />
      Still didn't check if the Macedonian LangStrings look ok.<br />
      Note: UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD is a macro that loads MUI_LANGUAGE and the LangStrings for a specific language (availaible on the NSIS site archive).
