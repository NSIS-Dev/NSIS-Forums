      <p class="post-content">The only InetLoad additional commands in the NSISdl display mode are SetWindowLong(WndProc) subclassings for Cancel handling. While it handles Cancel asynchronously, i.e. it sets flag and attempts to stop or terminate transfer, some weird behavior may occur this moment.<br>
      Attached is InetLoad version with some improvements, I tested on Cancel 20 times (dial-up) â€“ no crashes.<br>
      If my "WSA TRY AGAIN" changes looks correct, we also can create NSISdl script with 100 short files download and test current NSISdl status, I can do this from office LAN and home dial-up.</p>

      <p class="post-content">For now I suggest you update both InetLoad and NSISdl to fix this unsafe code. If someone gets a crash again we can continue to search for issues.<br>
      <br>
      Can you also post a compiled NSISdl with the WSATRY_AGAIN change? This NSISdl bug is easy to reproduce, it fails about 5-10% of all times.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tested on the fresh comp (office LAN, fast connection), plug-in resolve problem now not reproduces, I guess it is fixed, but extended test still required. urls.txt filling with 4 - 20 kB files links from all over the world may be very usefull for final testing (up to 100 links if we are talking about percents). Please note that NSISdl supports static files only (server reports content length and IE displays file size in the File-&gt;Properties).<br>
      About included screenshot: <a href="http://www.qstar.com" target="_blank">www.qstar.com</a> is not available now from IE and ping cannot resolve name to IP, so failue (and reason) is correct. On longer timeouts (120 sec) it reports resolve error after 3 gethostbyname attempts. DNS loop breaks if attempts count or timeout value exceeded.<br>
      Finally 2 files updated compare to last cvs version - asyncdns.h and asyncdns.cpp (attached).</p>

      <p class="post-content">So the problem is only with timeouts of the DNS server? All that is needed is to try again?<br>
      <br>
      About the mutex, it is named and therefore global. That could pose a problem with multiple installers running NSISdl simultaneously. A critical section should be used. It's faster too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No, as I wrote above DNS timeouts appeared to take 1-2% of all errors only in my tests. 98-99% were caused by some strange sync problem - gethostbyname() thread reports 'success', but main thread gets 'unresolvable'. The only idea I have about possible reason is a Windows strange behaviour on short sleeps (Sleep(10) was used in main loop).<br>
      Sections looks better, OK, I changed the code. I also reduces max DNS attempts count to 2 - this worked correct even with misconfigured DNS servers in our LAN.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I found out what the problem was. It was indeed a threading issue.</p>

      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Main loop asks for name resolution.</li>

        <li>A thread is created for the asynchronous operation.</li>

        <li>Main loop keeps querying the name resolution status.</li>

        <li>Main loop calls resolve().</li>

        <li>resolve() sees m_addr is still NULL just before its time slice ends.</li>

        <li>The name resolution thread gets a time slice, finishes the resolution and sets m_thread_kill to 1.</li>

        <li>resolve() goes back into action, sees m_thread_kill is 1 and tries to create a new thread.</li>

        <li>resolve() kills itself because m_thread still holds a valid thread handle.</li>

        <li>User gets a name resolution error even though the name was resolved.</li>
      </ol>This test for m_thread before creating a new thread is a bit problematic because m_thread is only reset in the destructor. To solve this in the simplest manner, I've removed m_thread_kill and added a member function that waits for the thread to die and resets m_thread. Once m_addr gets a result, the code will now call this function. The thread creation code will not create the thread until m_thread is NULL. This way, the class is now truly reusable and the issue above is solved because the test that caused it is no longer needed.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for your help.
