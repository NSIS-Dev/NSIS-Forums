      <p class="post-content"><strong>Automatically Update VER_BUILD when include file changed</strong><br />
      Using the VERSION method exemplified in the various samples that come with NSIS is straightforward and easy in a single file .nsi script:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        !ifndef VERSION<br />
        !define VER_MAJOR "3"<br />
        !define VER_MINOR "0"<br />
        !define VER_REVISION "1"<br />
        !define VER_BUILD "15"<br />
        !define VERSION ${VER_MAJOR}.${VER_MINOR}.${VER_REVISION}.${VER_BUILD}
      </blockquote>However, when the product's .nsi script remains unchanged but one (or more) of the !include files in it change, I currently must edit the product's .nsi file manually, <b>only to change VER_BUILD</b> (or VER_REVISION). This is currently my poor man's solution to reflect the fact that a newly compiled setup.exe is different from the previous one.<br />
      <br />
      My problem now is that I have numerous such main scripts and it is simply too tedious to manually update every one of them whenever a dependency !include file changes...<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way or solution to automatically increment VER_BUILD or VER_REVISION whenever one of the !include files in the script changes?

      <p class="post-content">This should get you thinking. Here's a snippet from one of my nsi scripts.</p>
      <pre>
<code>!execute "wscript.exe ..\BuildNum.vbs"<br />!include "BuildNum.nsh"<br />VIProductVersion  "${VERSION}.${BuildNum}"<br /></code>
</pre>and BuildNum.nsh looks like this:
      <pre>
<code>!define BuildNum 8274.5<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      Our development team defines the Major and Minor version numbers and I append a 4 digit value for the date plus a serialized number for the installer build number.

      <p class="post-content">There are several ways to do this:<br />
      <br />
      a)<br />
      use !execute or !system to generate some external nsh that you include<br />
      <br />
      b)<br />
      use !searchparse (or !define /file)<br />
      <br />
      c)<br />
      use a special include file that is both a valid nsis header and .h for C/C++ (See <a href="http://anders.nsis.pastebin.com/f575397bc" target="_blank">http://anders.nsis.pastebin.com/f575397bc</a> for a ugly example)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks demiller9 and Anders. I think that demiller9's suggestion along with Anders's option (a) is the only viable option, since the mechanism must be smart at least like make/nmake.<br />
      <br />
      The reason is that I need a system that knows several things, not one:[list=1][*] Determine which !include files are dependencies.[*] Determine that one of the !include dependency files is newer (based on timestamp and perhaps content).[*] Automatically increment the build number.[*] Perhaps more (did I forget something?)[/list=1]<br />
      Funny, because I initially thought of the setup program as something outside of the make/nmake system.<br />
      <br />
      But now it seems that good development methodology must involve make for compiling well structured NSIS scripts as well.</p>
