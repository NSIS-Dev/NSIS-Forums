      Have problems with $PROGRAMFILES under German Windows Vista. In German Windows Vista program files are usually copied to "c:\programme\..." but got "c:\program files\...". Works fine under Windows XP. Any hints?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Program Files is the proper name of the directory. The changed name is a result of all Vista editions being MUI-based: the directory is always called Program Files, and the localized name is a virtual folder, pointing to the "real" one.<br />
      <br />
      The reason you see Programme in Explorer, is that it uses API calls to format the displayed path according to the active language pack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Many thanks for your clarification and you're right. The installation also works with "Program Files" but I'm afraid German / non English end customers will get confused. On other Microsoft operation systems the Installation Folder dialog (Destination Folder) shows the localized name. Any ideas / pointers how I can get the virtual folder name?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, you shouldn't expect it to work if you wrote "Programme" - the handling of that virtual folder can be a bit peculiar at times.<br />
      <br />
      Displaying the localized path: Take a look at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/01/18/1487464.aspx#1736328" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archiv...4.aspx#1736328</a> - there's some sample C code to get the path. I think it might need to be integrated in the NSIS executable, though - I'm not sure if it's doable using only NSIS scripts.<br />
      <br />
      As for confusion - you're right that this happens, but in my experience, people learn to deal with it after their first install of a program that doesn't use this approach (which is pretty much anything not MSI-based).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I stumbled over this thread by searching for the $PROGRAMFILES problem under german Windows Vista / Windows 7.<br />
      <br />
      Well, I need to write the $INSTDIR Path, which consists of the $PROGRAMFILES constant, to the registry to get an external program starting the installed application.<br />
      The problem is that the external program cannot start the application, because of the wrong path.<br />
      <br />
      During installation he shows "C:\Program Files\Application"<br />
      and thats the path he writes to the registry, but the application will be installed to "C:\Programme\Application".<br />
      <br />
      Im getting really frustrated ... there must be a solution for this I think?<br />
      <br />
      I hope you can help me out :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">The situation is no different: C:\Programme doesn't really exist, the folder is really called C:\Program Files and Vista/7 uses the API call mentioned in my previous to localize the displayed path in Explorer.<br />
      <br />
      You can verify this for yourself by opening a command prompt and navigating there, since that doesn't localize anything.<br />
      <br />
      Your other application should not fail as long as Program Files is what's being written to the registry. If it does, then you probably have some other problem - like having told your installer to not elevate (in which case it *can't* write to Program Files if UAC is on).</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks guys for bringing this topic up.<br />
      simple question: is there a way to just extract the localized name of the "Program Files" from the registry or something ?<br />
      <br />
      which means, do we have a way to extract the strings like: "Programme" or "Archivos De Programma" which are equivalent to "Program Files" ?<br />
      <br />
      thanks in anticipation :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is rather old thread, but I have the same problem now. Is there a new idea how I can show the virtual name when the user selects the installation path? Is there a plug-in for this?</p>

      Thank for the code. I compiled it, but the message box doesn't appear. It looks that R3 is always 0, but I don't know why. I don't understand too much from this code. Can you help me to start it up, please?</p>
