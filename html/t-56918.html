      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS GUI Update - Slate Blue 0.0.25</strong><br />
      Slate Blue, my GUI for NSIS, has reached a phenomenal point: it will now parse &amp; load settings from scripts. the only setback is that it only loads the nsis options that it supports.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.morphedmedia.com/slateblue/SlateBlue0025.exe" target="_blank">http://www.morphedmedia.com/slateblue/SlateBlue0025.exe</a><br />
      <br />
      it now comes with its own NSIS installer, with the script created by Slate Blue.<br />
      <br />
      I have also put up the info page on it, at:<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>huh?</strong><br />
      i'm not exactly sure what you mean. can you expand on "add something that adds attributes from a pull down menu"?<br />
      <br />
      also, what do you mean, "it was a good idea"? the parsing, or the whole program. isn't it a good idea anymore? :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">It is still a good idea, but it needs more work. I know this sounds demanding, but that is what you have to expect. When I said, "add something that adds attributes," I ment that (if it is possible) have something that would add items and other flags or compiler attributes ($INSTDIR, $WINDIR, IfFileExists, etc.). Plus, have something that would add expandablity to the program (like a Text document that allows a user to add the attributes or some text document that can be updated/upgraded when "patched"). These are my ideas, I hope you like.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>cool</strong><br />
      so a dropdown menu containing different compiler/script options, rather than textboxes doing the same thing? like a dropdown that, when an item is selected, an inputbox pops up and the user is asked to enter say $INSTDIR?<br />
      <br />
      and the text document idea, you mean like macros, or just being able to edit the script while inside my program?<br />
      <br />
      thanks, i appreciate the criticism.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The pull down is an GOOD IDEA. But the text document I was talking about was something like a webserver's .conf or a .ini would work. That way, you could edit a text document and not have to do much updates, just a text document. I would not know how this work properly, but if you need help, just reply. Also, add a plug-in (.dll or something like that) that could add expandablity to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/nsdn/pimp/" target="_blank">PiMP install system</a>. Just a thought.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>so...</strong><br />
      an .ini file that has basic settings, then the user just changes the specific settings?<br />
      <br />
      plugins would be nice :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">yea, but have a default .ini file included just in case that the user messes up. I thought you might like the idea of plug-ins, that way, (if you added the source to do this) other developers that created their own Enhanced NSIS language could add expandability. <a href="http://64.12.38.241/showthread.php?threadid=55510" target="_blank">Like this</a>.<br />
      <br />
      Plus, I'm working on an NSIS Project House on SourceForge.net . If I could get your permission and the program, I would like to add it to the website. :D :)<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>cool</strong><br />
      i <b>am</b> releasing the source to it, and i <b>will</b> let you post it on your Sourceforge site.<br />
      <br />
      can you just link to the file on my server, so i can accurately track downloads, or does it have to be on sourceforge?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It can act like a mirror, but if you don't want it on the NSIS site, then I will link it to your site, just let me know when a new release is coming before you release it, that way I could update the site.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I made an actual GUI for NSIS a while ago, I just updated it with the latest downloadable NSIS source code and exe header. I.e. you dont need the seperate makensis.exe console program.<br />
      <br />
      Included is source code to the project and makefile.<br />

      - note this was more of a slap dash effort to get a gui on NSIS at the time. It probably contains a few bugs, but works.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, I decided that I would be terrible at writing a GUI so I decided to contribue makensis.dll to the cause of an NSIS GUI.<br />
      <br />
      Using the DLL would probably be a little quicker than running the console version and it has an easy callback function to allow logging in a window or something.<br />
      <br />
      it can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.windridge.junglelink.co.uk/nsisdll.zip" target="_blank">http://www.windridge.junglelink.co.uk/nsisdll.zip</a> (headers and .lib file included, but I dont know about using it in a VB project).</p>
