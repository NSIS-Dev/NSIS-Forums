      <p class="post-content"><strong>my installer does not work on WINDOWS 7, but works fine in XP &amp; Vista...?</strong><br />
      One part of my installer invokes a 3rd party installer using Execwait.<br />
      Its been working fine in XP and Vista.<br />
      <br />
      For some reason, on Windows 7, the 3rd party installer simply refuses to invoke.<br />
      <br />
      If I exit my installer and double-click on the same 3rd party installer in Windows Explorer, it invokes fine.<br />
      As I say, the installer invokes fine from XP so the spelling etc is right.<br />
      <br />
      Why isn't it invoking from NSIS on Win7?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's not like you are giving us much to go on here.<br />
      <br />
      Do you have "requestexecutionlevel admin" in your script?<br />
      Is UAC on under Vista AND 7? Are they both 32 bit?<br />
      <br />
      Try Process Monitor and see why the process dies...</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks, I changed the execution level from "user" to:<br />
      RequestExecutionLevel highest<br />
      and this seemed to fix it. Now the 3rd party installer invokes fine.<br />
      <br />
      I just hope and assume that this execution level change doesn't affect other things. I'll give it a test on a few other 7,XP, Vista machines and see how it performs on those platforms.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You should take a look at the manifest for this other installer (Resource Hacker or hex editor) and match its executionlevel. Highest is probably not enough, usually you want user or admin.</p>
