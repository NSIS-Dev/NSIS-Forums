      <p class="post-content"><strong>.NET Framework Section Question</strong><br />
      &nbsp; I have already created a function for checking if the .NET Framework is installed (attached). If neither version is installed, I would like the installer to create a read-only section with ".NET Framework". On the finish page, it would be nice if I could get a checked/read-only box with "Install .NET Framework Now" which runs the setup program after it has been unpacked and the have it run silently with:</p>
      <pre>
<code>ExecWait</code>('".NET Framework 1.1 Redistributable Final Beta.exe" dotnetfx.exe /q:a /c:"install /l /q"' 
</pre>If the .NET Framework is detected, I would like nothing to be done. (No setup program extracted, nothing installed but the main program.)<br />
      <br />
      Is this feasible?

      <p class="post-content">AFAIK there is no instruction that can change the read-only parameter of a Section. So it isn't (yet) possible. Maybe an idea for NSIS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm, that'll be okay for now.<br />
      <br />
      I was just wondering if it is possible to add sections using functions. So is this (adding sections with functions) currently possible?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's not possible to create functions but it is possible to change every flag of a section <b>including read-only</b> at runtime using SectionSetFlags and SectionGetFlags. You must do it before or after the components page shows because while it does you can only change the selected and bold flag.<br />
      <br />
      What you need to do is create a RO section with the approriate name. Upon runtime, if you don't need this section to be shown in the components page and executed set its flags to not have SF_SELECTED and set its name to nothing.<br />
      <br />
      For example:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>StrCmp$0 "noneed" 0 donthide
<br />  # 0 doesn't include SF_SELECTED of course :)
<br /> SectionSetFlags ${SEC} 0
<br />  SectionSetText${SEC} ""
<br />&gt;donthide: 
</code>

      <p class="post-content">I have decided to take a difference approach and check for .NET using ASP 3.0, which points you to the version of the installer that you need.<br />
      <br />
      Now I need the installer to instead extract a file from itself to a temp directory, ExecWait that file, and then delete that file after the setup is over. How can I accomplish this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try this:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
InitPluginsDir
<br />File/oname=$PLUGINSDIR/file2exec.exe mylocalfile.exe 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>Then just exec the file and the file will be deleted automatically when the installer finishes because it is in the plugins dir. If you are using Modern UI, i believe it already inits the plugins dir so that line is not neeeded.
