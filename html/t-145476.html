      <p class="post-content"><strong>If I start an application during uninstall, uninstall freezes at end</strong><br />
      Hi Guys,<br />
      <br />
      In my uninstall process, I restart HotSync.exe. If I use 'Add/Remove Programs' to do the uninstall, the uninstall freezes at the end until I exit out of HotSync.exe. Then it finishes normally.<br />
      <br />
      I have tried everything I can think of. It doesn't matter how I restart HotSync.exe, if it is still running when the uninstaller finishes, I'm hosed.<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas? This doesn't happen with InstallShield.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Not using ExecWait. The normal way to do it is to just call `HsSetAppStatus(HsRestart,0);'. This is a Palm call to restart HotSync.exe. If you run the uninstaller outside of Add/Remove, it does appear to finish and removes itself from the task list. 'Add/Remove Programs' just gets stuck when it is done.<br />
      <br />
      I have also tried exec and CreateProcess. In CreateProcess, I tell it to be a separate process. Same results no matter what I try.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've had similar problems with Hotsync when removing a conduit. I suspect it has something to do with with the Add/Remove Programs monitoring of the files under the directory you're uninstalling from (however it does that size estimate), perhaps because typically you're removing your conduit DLL and/or program-specific copies of the Palm DLLs.<br />
      <br />
      (EDIT: I remove the conduit by calling out to Palm's PCI.exe rather than using a plugin, so I'm fairly confident it's not my fault.)<br />
      <br />
      I never found a solution, and had to resort to the brute force method: before uninstallation just kill Hotsync altogether (FindWindow "KittyHawk" "Hotsync Manager", then SendMessage hwd 48837 1 0), and afterwards tell the user they'll have to restart Hotsync Manager themselves, or restart their computer :/</p>
