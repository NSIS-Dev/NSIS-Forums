Basically based on the error message you sent, there is a call to realloc() that fails, which should only really happen when you run out of memory. Perhaps I should put a check for realloc() failing, and do a seperate malloc/memcpy/free..

Which is pretty decent sized. My guess is that Windows 98 may have issues with creating 483mb memory mapped files. The system may be low on address space (the compiler needs to map the whole datablock in at once, unfortunately). With a 500mb installer, it may make more sense to store some of the data in other files, or try using Windows 2000 (or NT4, or some other OS that supports large amounts of memory better than Win98).<br><br>update: I duplicated this on my winME box. Freakin' win9x. OK well what I'm thinking I may do is make the compiler only map in parts at a time, which would enable this to work on win9x, but the downside would be when the installs got very large, datablock optimizations would be VERY slow (and should be disabled).
