The application is based on Java technology. The install needs to manage the following steps:<br><br>1. Checks if the Java Runtime (JVM) is available or not<br>2. If not, updates the size of the installer on the fly to update the user about the size required for installation.<br>3. Goes for downloading of the JVM from a central server, and installs it silently.<br><br>I would like to have a way by which I can update the size required in destination drive. I have tried using macro but could not do so...<br><br>Can anyone help me on this..<br><br>Thanks in advance...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th November 2002 16:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Use AddSize on a hidden section and enable/disable this section according to your check of Java.<br><br>Example script attached.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dattuit</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th November 2002 10:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for your response.<br><br>I have tried with the script you have sent, just generated the java.exe using makensis but still could not get it work...
