If I do:<br></p><pre>
<code>nsDialogs::Create 1018<br>${NSD_CreateLink}  180u 132u 50% 13u "End User License Agreement"<br>Pop $Link<br>${NSD_OnClick} $Link LinkClick</code>
</pre><br>
      The link works as it should, I get a hover hand, and the function "LinkClick" is executed. However, if I change the dialogID to 1044 then the I do not get a hover hand and LinkClick is not executed.<br>
      <br>
      Why is this, and how can I fix it?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for any advice.

      <p class="post-content">Are you trying to create a full screen UI (like the welcome and finish pages?) If so then you need to put <i>Call muiPageLoadFullWindow</i> before your code and <i>Call muiPageUnloadFullWindow</i> after.

      </blockquote>Yes, I'm tryig to create a full screen UI. I do have a finish page and welcome page.<br>
      <br>
      I think that you are on to something as we've made progress here. If I add <i>Call muiPageLoadFullWindow</i> before my code and <i>Call muiPageUnloadFullWindow</i> after <b>AND</b> move my link to the top of the page by setting the Y coordinate of the link to 0u then the link works. Then if I move it back down the page where it belongs it stops working. Seems like a Z order thing for sure. Any other thoughts?

      <p class="post-content">Is your code in a custom page show function? Nothing else should be covering up your link unless you have other controls in your custom page. If you have a machine with Visual Studio installed you can inspect the windows using Spy++ (use the search tool).<br>

      </blockquote>Thanks for your help Stu, Spy++ was a great idea. After running it I was able to see that other transparent controls were over my links and that is why they were not working. I suppose the reason that they worked on 1018 dialogs is because I had to rearrange them in order to see them since they are lower down on the 1044 dialog. When I moved the links up in the Y direction to test they were no longer buried under the offending transparent controls.<br>
      <br>
      The solution for me was to rearrange the order that I create controls so that the links are created first and the other controls created later. This caused the expected behavior.<br>
      <br>
      Again, thanks for the help.
