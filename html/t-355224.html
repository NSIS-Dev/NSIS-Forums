      <p class="post-content">i've attached a first working version showcasing what i'm trying to accomplish. unfortunately, this is currently a one-way, older combobox items do not get restored. not sure what would be the best practice to do so, should i listen whether the delete key was pressed (and how does that work?) or simply compare whether the input length got shorter compared to a previous input?<br>
      <br>
      edit: to see what this example does, start typing any command from the combobox, e.g. "border"</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'm wondering how that can be a desired behaviour, onChange should really listen to both cases, especially since combining onChange and onClick doesn't work as one would expect. if there's need for seperating both (and i can't think of a scenario), it'd probably good to have a third macro. any thoughts on this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You probably want to iterate all of the available options and not all of the items in the combobox when filtering. This way, if someone hits the backspace, you still get all the other options.<br>
      <br>
      To get text from a combobox item, one System::Call is enough. No need to allocate stuff and use the built-in SendMessage.<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code># new<br>System::Call "user32::SendMessage(i $ComboBox, i ${CB_GETLBTEXT}, i r9, t.r2)"<br>                <br># old<br>#System::Alloc ${NSIS_MAX_STRLEN}<br>#Pop $1<br>#SendMessage $ComboBox ${CB_GETLBTEXT} $9 $1<br>#System::Call "*$1(&amp;t32.r2)"<br>#System::Free $1</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      As for the last issue of choosing something with the mouse, I'm not sure why this happens, but Anders is probably right. In any case, you can work around it by calling CB_GETCURSEL first and checking if it returns -1 or not. If it returns a value, the user selected that item. If not, the user typed something.<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>SendMessage $ComboBox ${CB_GETCURSEL} 0 0 $9<br>${If} $9 != -1<br>        # user selected something<br>        System::Call "user32::SendMessage(i $ComboBox, i ${CB_GETLBTEXT}, i r9, t .R0)"<br>${Else}<br>        ${NSD_GetText} $ComboBox $R0<br>${EndIf}</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Attached is my almost working version. I'm sure you can take it from here.
