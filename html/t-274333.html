<code><br>!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_LEAVE verifyComponentReqs<br>!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_COMPONENTS<br></code>
</pre><br>
      Unfortunately during this process you can still click on the Components Page. You can select/deselect components, click install again, which can lead to <b>corrupt installer messages and installer crashes</b>.<br>
      <br>
      I display a banner in the method, but it takes 1-2 seconds to load the DLL so you can still click on the buttons. I disable the Install button, but you can still select components. Is there a way to lock the dialog? I have a few ideas on workarounds:<br>
      <br>
      A) Load the banner DLL earlier. Is there a way to load a plugin DLL explicitly without calling a plugin function? I suppose I can do "Banner::destroy /NOUNLOAD" but that seem really hacky.<br>
      <br>
      B) Use the next page's PRE callback instead, and then go back to the Components Page if the conditions aren't met. But this isn't ideal from a usability standpoint because it will seem to the user that they're already in the install progress, which they're not.<br>
      <br>
      I'd appreciate any suggestions/corrections.<br>

      As for loading the Banner faster, it's probably due to the solid compression. Simply ReserveFile it on the top of the script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I spent some time stripping down my installer and discovered that it has something to do with the FindProcDLL I'm using, <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FindProcDLL_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FindProcDLL_plug-in</a> (although it may not be *specific* to that DLL). If you double-click on "install" very quickly, you should see the error. I've included the repro script below, and attached a screenshot of the error.<br>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS 2.28 - I am using several other plugins (but as I understand it, they won't be include if they aren't used).<br>
      <br>
      Otherwise the only file that's different from a stock install is the Banner.dll (due to the banner hanging bug, forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=270838&amp;highlight=banner)<br>
      <br>
      You have to double-click very quickly in this sample... perhaps your computer is too fast? :) In my production script you can wait a few seconds before the second click and still see the error.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Anders - thanks for you suggestion. In case anyone else might find it useful, I used the following:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>FindWindow $1 "#32770" "" $HWNDPARENT<br>FindWindow $1 "SysTreeView32" "" $1<br>EnableWindow $1 0<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      kichik - Since I'm using the above workaround, I think our installer is okay for now but it's still probably better to figure out why the dialog is not blocking. Would it help if I performed a clean install of NSIS and try to repro?
