      <p class="post-content"><strong>File /r new behavior?</strong><br />
      I've just updated my install script in order to be used with the nsis new version (2.2 -&gt; 2.4).<br />
      <br />
      After changing the name of the mui functions (I hope this will work in the same way as in the previous version. Ex: mui_pagecommand_welcome -&gt; mui_page_welcome), I've compiled it without errors.<br />
      <br />
      The problem is that when I execute the installer it fails in line File /r mydirectory and popups a message with abort,retry and ignore buttons saying that files cannot be copied. In this directory there are subdirectories but it doesn't work for any file. I have tried using with an * but the same error occurs, these files are not copied.<br />
      <br />
      If somebody could help me it would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for your fast reply!! I've read the linked thread but maybe I don't understand it correctly but if that was a bug it would be solved in new versions, no?.<br />
      <br />
      What you mean is that it should work in a way like this?<br />
      <br />
      File /r mydirectory\*<br />
      <br />
      Because using this instruction it only works for files directly in mydirectory but not for the subdirectories.<br />
      <br />
      BTW I've tried to do it in another way and then it works without /r in the following way:<br />
      <br />
      File mydirectory\*.*<br />
      File mydirectory\subdirectory1\*.*<br />
      File mydirectory\subdirectory2\*.*<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, thanks but it could be very anoying to write this for many subdirectories.</p>

      <p class="post-content">`File /r mydirectory\*` should include all of the subdirectories under mydirectory. It will not include other files or directories named mydirectory below the current working directory like `File /r mydirectory` does.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I thought that way should add subdirectories too...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, ok I think I start to understand it but I could talk about this for centuries and I wouldn't understand it completely. It's a bit complicated.<br />
