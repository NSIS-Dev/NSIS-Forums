So, in case it does not, I would greatly appreciate if you could point me towards the right one.</b><br><br>I created an installer that executes a couple of INF files and install a kernel driver; the installer works fine.<br><br>Most customers insert their pci card and boot up their computers for the first time; this initializes the Hardware Found Wizard, which confuses them.<br><br>The customer usually use the wizard to point to our installation cd, which does not find any INF file with the ID and fails; when the wizard fails they think that there was an error with the driver installer, and never try the full installer. (of course they call us)<br><br>I was just wondering if the installer can be called from the Hardware Found Wizard. maybe through calling an INF file? Any other suggestions are welcomed.<br><br>Thanks,</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd June 2011 06:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">No, it's not possible to launch the installer from the new hardware wizard. The solution is simple, though: Don't use the File command to compile the files into the installer exe, but use the CopyFiles command to copy plain, normal files from the CD. You can use the $EXEDIR variable to point to the CD. This way the files are available for the hardware wizard to find.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jai123</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2011 14:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for the reply.<br><br>The drivers that I am installing have 2 PNP INF files and a non-PNP component, is it possible to install all these 3 components from the Hardware Found Wizard?<br><br>So far I have been only able to install one of the INF files</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2011 15:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I've no idea how inf files work, but I don't think that's really an NSIS related question.
