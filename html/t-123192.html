      <p class="post-content"><strong>CHM Help System</strong><br />
      Just wanted to let everybody know that my progress is well along<br />
      on a new help system. It is a .chm file. So far it is just basic<br />
      very similar to the current in content. However, design is much better. I have not included an index yet, that will be later. But it<br />
      does have a Favorites tab and full text search capabilties. It should<br />
      only be about 2 days and I will post a beta version.<br />
      <br />
      I planned for other people to help design the little things. On my TODO list:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>create a nice looking welcome page (with an animated graphic, etc.)</li>

        <li>a common header for all or most of the pages</li>

        <li>a new css style</li>

        <li>an index</li>

        <li>much more (submit ideas)</li>
      </ul><br />
      I also have a chm compiler. I will include it with the source code.<br />
      The source is just a bunch of .html files. More on this later.<br />
      <br />
      Here is link to Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop:<br />

      I am using it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Don't forget that the CHM needs to be easely update-able, which means, that if you want to change the data, that you don't have to dive into the HTML, and if you want to change the markup, that you don't have to change it at in 20 pages. It would be great (at least, i think) if you had/made something that reads the same files as the source files of the documentation, but creates a CHM out of it.</p>

      I am not quite sure what you mean.<br />
      The .chm help system does support a split option. You can tag a html file so that when it is compiled it is split into several files.<br />
      <br />
      My next post will contain my progress so far. I think that you will find the layout easy to use and logical.<br />
      <br />
      Thanx</p>
