      <p class="post-content"><strong>Compiling an NSIS Script on a Web Server</strong><br />
      I have a very simple installation script that places a few files in specific directories on the user's PC. I have been running this successfully for a long time on my PC, but I would like to automate the process so that the installation file is created on my website.<br />
      <br />
      I have studied the NSIS documentation, read the Wiki, and searched the forum, but can find nothing about this.<br />
      <br />
      My website is on GoDaddy.com (on a shared server) and I use php. Here is what I would like to do.<br /></p>

      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Create the user files on the server</li>

        <li>Run MakeNSIS on the server to bundle the files into an installation executable</li>

        <li>Send the user an email with a link to the installation routine</li>
      </ol>I can do #1 and #3, but I cannot find any guidance on #2. Has anyone done this or something like it?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I asume you talk about a linux machine, right? One way would be to have wine installed on this machine. Then you can run the makensis compiler through wine.<br />
      <br />
      But this can only work if you have enough permissions on the machine to install software and run shell scripts.</p>
