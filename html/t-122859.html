It is pretentious to say it's possible. For a normal time estimation one will have to bench all HDs used by installation, miraculously calculate the time required for any executed programs to run and the time that each Windows API call will consume. All of this, assuming nothing else will get in the way and add time and that nothing is cached or there are no weird accelerators running in the background. NSIS does hell of a lot more than just extract, it's impossible to estimate the time left.<br><br>As for welcome and finish pages, Joost will answer that.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">virtlink</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th January 2003 14:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You say that Windows Installers are almost always wrong with their time remaining calculations. It mostly takes less time than predicted. This will give the user the feeling that his system is very fast, or that the installer is very fast ;).<br>But could the installer have a constant 'initial time per byte' to calculate the time remaining, then install the first file, measuring the time that it costed. The number of bytes divided by the time returns the new 'time per byte', which is more accurate. Use this for every file, and, as the installation progresses, the time is more precise.<br><br>Just an idea. If you gonna tell me that for a small file the 'time per byte' is lower than for a big file, then ignore me please.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th January 2003 14:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>NSIS does hell of a lot more than just extract, it's impossible to estimate the time left.</blockquote></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">veekee</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th January 2003 14:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">About time :<br><br>i searched fot time left.. and didn't found anything :( Sorry about that :( !<br>By the way, i though too that displaying the time left was quite hard.. but, i tought you could know any tips to calculate it .... ;)<br><br>Well, by the way, i'm currently watching the first episodes of John Doe ... niiiice :p ;) :D !

There are so many variables that there is no way to tell what state the users machine is in at the time of the install that would help you estimate this.
