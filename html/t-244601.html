      <p class="post-content"><strong>Section / SectionGroup order of execution</strong><br />
      Hi There,<br />
      <br />
      I was wondering if there was a way to override the Section or SectionGroup order of execution without re-arranging things. From what I have seen and read, Sections are executed in the order they appear in the script.<br />
      <br />
      Here's a long-winded description of whats going on - in case my above question isnt clear:<br />
      <br />
      I have a script that sets up a queue of pages like this: (I oversimplified the following to save space)<br />
      ------------------------------------------<br />
      Page components<br />
      Page directory ; window to select main install dir<br />
      Page directory ; window to select secondary install dir<br />
      Page instfiles<br />
      ------------------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      Then I setup my SectionGroups and Sections like this:<br />
      ------------------------------------------<br />
      SectionGroup "base components"<br />
      Section "base config files"<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      Section "base cgi scripts"<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      Section "base fast-cgi scripts"<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      SectionGroupEnd<br />
      SectionGroup "3rd party components"<br />
      Section "apache webserver"<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      Section "activeperl"<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      SectionGroupEnd<br />
      ------------------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      Based on this configuration, what happens is:<br />
      - User selects components<br />
      *if any base compoents were selected:<br />
      - install base components<br />
      *if any 3rd party components were selected:<br />
      - install 3rd party components<br />
      Finish<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      What I want to happen is:<br />
      - User selects components<br />
      *if any 3rd party components were selected:<br />
      - install 3rd party components<br />
      *if any base components were selected:<br />
      - prompt user to select target dirs for each selection<br />
      - install base components<br />
      - Finish<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I am pretty sure puting the 3rd Party selection group above the base component group would do this ... BUT I really want the base components at the top of the select list.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Nick</p>

      <p class="post-content">I found this thread after a little searching:<br />
      <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=228983&amp;highlight=section+order" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....=section+order</a><br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure I completely get what is being described here and if I do, I was kind of hoping there was a cleaner way to do this in NSIS, since its almost the exact kluge that innoSetup relies on to accomplish this and the reason I came to NSIS. I really like NSIS btw - the eclipse plugin is very nice!<br />
      <br />
      So anyway, if I understand what was being said, I strip out all of the executing code from my sections and replace them with code that sets flags so I know if that section was selected.<br />
      <br />
      I then create a hidden section that executes last, inside of which I evaluate each flag and conditionally run the code I originally had in the sections themselves.<br />
      <br />
      Is that the cleanest solution possible?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok...I tried to implement the flags idea...and it looks like I couldnt do it on my own...im not so sure the flags suggestion will work, at least the way currently I understand it.<br />
      <br />
      My best guess is that Page instfiles is what is controlling the 'when' of things. I'll keep reading and checking back here to see if anybody has some advice for me.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I found a solution - part of the problem was my oversight of something pretty obvious: my particular problem ended up having nothing to do with the order of sections and sectiongroups and everything to do with pages.<br />
      <br />
      I solved my particular issue by registering a callback for leave_function with the components page. In the callback I extract and install the 3rd party components, if any were selected.<br />
      <br />
      Kinda ugly but at least it works.<br />
