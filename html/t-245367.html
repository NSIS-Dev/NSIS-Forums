      Hi All,<br />
      <br />
      I've never used NSIS or any other such software before, and I was looking to use NSIS to create an installer for a freeware product to launch with a new website I am working on. My planned launch date is getting close and I still have lots and lots of work to do with my website. I'm starting to think that I may not have time to learn NSIS syntax, plus create my script to a level I would want to put my name to by the time I launch my site. I was just wondering if any NSIS guru's were available to hire to create my script for a fee? I will still see how I go having a crack myself, but it is starting to look more and more likely that I won't have time to get both my installer and website ready in time, and just wanted to explore the possibility of paying someone to do it for me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can help. Give a dummy directory structure and a list of registry keys and start menu shortcuts, and anything else the installer should do, and I will make an installer using MUI. Please email the info to me (just trying to be private about it). Email: <a href="mailto:mousehelmet@hotmail.com">mousehelmet@hotmail.com</a><br />
      Could be a few days before you will get a script. I am just trying to help.</p>
