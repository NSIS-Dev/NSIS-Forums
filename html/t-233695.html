Today I was looking at it again and I seem to be missing some files to be able to build it again (namely the files in NSISDIR\Contrib\ExDll)<br><br>Now it's been some time since I worked on this, but looking around I'm guessing they're part of the nsis-source, which aren't distributed in the installer anymore, so I guess I'll need to download the sources from sourceforge.<br><br>Still, I wonder how I ever succeeded in creating a plugin, since I can't seem to find any documentation about how to go about it. Can anyone tell me where I can find that information?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Remco</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st December 2005 13:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">There isn't really any documentation to my knowledge. You just need to read up in ExDll.c (which as you rightly said is only found in the source package).<br>It's a piece of cake really (unless you have no programming experience of course!)<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
