SB has a script window, unfortunately uneditable, but if it will be editable it`ll be good make something, that when you write one or two first characters of a function name, some function prototypes will apear in some window. so if user has short memory he will saw what functions exists and what for parameters they need... like in M$ Visual C++, you type for ex.: "Beg" you press Ctrl-Space (autocomplete) and some little window apears with all functions... when you write the full function name like: "BeginPaint(" then apears another tooltip window or what with required parameters... it`ll be great, don`t you think???<br><br>and sorry for my bad english...:D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Repzilon</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th October 2001 22:39 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Something like M$ Intellisense would be rather long to program.
