Then, as was mentioned in previous posts, there are several ways to use Visual Studio to invoke the NSIS compiler on the generated script to "build" it. This would essentially automate the process of maintaining NSIS scripts for VS projects.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
