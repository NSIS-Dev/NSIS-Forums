      <p class="post-content"><strong>Completely hide everything after components</strong><br />
      Actually this is a question.<br />
      <br />
      After the pressing "Install &gt;" on the Components page I need to hide installer completely like in the silent mode (there is the only page there - Install).<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, using "Hidewindow" Components page is shown for the part of second and this is not good. tried different combinations of "Hidewindow" in the MUI custom page PRE SHOW of Install page and and LEAVE of the Components but with no luck as well as "ShowWindow $HWNDPARENT 0"<br />
      <br />
      Please help.</p>

      </blockquote>This installer is part of another one. Main one (web based) shows own license page and other information and runs this installer, but actually 2 pages: selecting installation directory and components. everything else should be hidden (including installation page).
