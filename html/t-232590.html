I write as someone whose favorite project was writing a 68k structured assembler in 68k native asm back in the mid 80's. asm is way cool &lt;g&gt;<br><br>BUT ... my 2¢ worth is to agree with the thread starter ... the push/pop and strcmp then jump +3 nature of nsis is archaic and probably holding it back.<br><br>I consider nsis an extraordinary accomplishment and definitely appreciate its minimal overhead size. A significant niche of the freeware apps I work on is for obsolete donated computers in 3rd world countries where POTS modems are still the norm, so size matters.<br><br>However, I would speculate that its minimal overhead of 34kb would only expand by several kb to support basic if-then-else and while-continue-break ... which is more than you really need to have the equivalent of for-loop and do-while.<br><br>My (non-counting) vote would be that nsis ver 2.x or 3.x have a significant degree of integrated if-then-else and while-break-continue support that is native to nsis, rather than an external plug-in with ${} macros.<br><br>But obviously easier said than done.<br><br>But this isn't criticism ... nsis is super. I suppose a case could be made that if you get into deep if-then-else nesting and/or outer-inner loops, then you need to rethink what you are doing.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JasonFriday13</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th February 2006 21:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I find that the language is very easy to code, in some ways is similiar to C/C++, in other ways to html, again similiar to MFC (a part of C/C++).<br><br>At the moment I am learning C/C++, after coding in VB for a few years.

Still it would be nice to have features such as while/for loops and if/else conditionals because its more friendly to C++/Java/PHP programmers. The main concern of a language overhaul is backwards-compatibility - things like installer attributes (Name, Caption, OutFile) where do they fit in python?<br><br>One thing I certainly don't like with nsis is the script efficiency. With things like the ExperienceUI it's ok on newer computers but sometimes slow on old ones. When you compile an nsi file the code is parsed and written to a binary file, and the compiled code is again parsed by a runtime execution routine (which is ~25kb of the installer overhead). If the code were converted to native c++ at compile time this would speed things up (if this is possible - I hardly know any c++ so this is purely an idea)<br><br>In summary, the scripting language is great for those who are good at it (I've been with NSIS since version 1.91 which is about three years I think, and I've pretty much mastered it) but bad for newbies. Which is why there are so many posts on this forum offering $50-$100 for coding an nsis setup.<br><br></p><pre>
<code><br>for(int i=1;i!=0;i++) {  // Infinite loop<br>  while(newScriptLanguage.location!="myHead") {<br>    for(int i=0;i&lt;=100;i++) think(newScriptLanguage);<br>  }<br>  if(oldScript.compatibility==newScript.compatibility) break;<br>}<br></code>
