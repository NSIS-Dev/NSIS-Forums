      The codes you want to convert the letters into are inverted ASCII (ASCII that has been subtracted from 255).<br />

      <p class="post-content">The attached should work. (I've not tested it very well, but from the little I did, it works.)<br />
      <br />
      It relies on outputing a "translation file" (basically a config file I use to "look up" each letter of the string.) It relies on logiclib, ConfigReadS, and ConfigWriteS.<br />
      <br />
      One problem, however, is that I wasn't able to write the translation code for the backward quote (`). Not sure whether or not this is a bug with NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      Here's the line that failed:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />${ConfigWriteS} "${TranslatorFile}" "`=" "9f" $1<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Maybe someone else would have some suggestions.<br />
      <br />
      Since it uses a file, speed might become an issue if you have to translate large sets of data. (If you need to boost performance, you might try using the NSIS Array plugin instead of a file to use for the lookup table).<br />
      <br />
      I've wrapped it into an NSH file. Usage is simple:<br />
      1) Include TextToCode.nsh in the top of your script<br />
      2) Add the command ${InitTranslator} to .OnInit<br />
      3) to translate text, use ${TextToCode} "text" $var (where $var is your output variable)<br />
      <br />
      See the attached sample.

      I was thinking it looked like HEX codes, but they didn't seem to be the same HEX codes as a regular PC uses. (Maybe I'm wrong?)</p>

      Both of a variant approach, but at demiller9 the idle time (that that is necessary)<br />

      </blockquote>It is standard hex ASCII that has been XOR'd with FF. I caught onto it when I looked at the codes for the digits 1-9. The Qwerty layout in the original message makes it harder to spot for the letters.<br />
      <br />
      I didn't check a backquote in my method until I read your post; my test program handles `, ', and " OK.<br />

      </blockquote>My profound thanks to demiller for saving me tons of time :D Paying it forward, I used this as a base for a URLEncode function and these are the adjustments that I made:<br />
      <br />
      Add these two lines at the appropriate places:<br />
      !include "WordFunc.nsh"<br />
      !insertmacro WordFind<br />
      <br />
      And then this is URLEncode function, based on demiller's StrToCodes (with un-inverted ASCII :) )<br />
