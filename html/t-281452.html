      <p class="post-content"><strong>License page delay when using rtf file</strong><br />
      If I use an RTF formatted file for my license file there is a noticable delay before it appears. The page shows up with the license portion blank - it is even worse when using modern or ultra-modern ui, there you actually have to drag the mouse over the text to get it to appear. The problem doesn't seem to affect it when I use a .txt file.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone experienced this or found a workaround?</p>

      <p class="post-content">ReserveFile won't affect the license file as the license isn't kept in the files block, it's kept in the string table. The string table is always at the top of the compressed data along with the other headers.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The rtf license is 23k. Does anyone else use RTF license files?<br />
      <br />
      Also the problem appears in all versions of the ui, including the classic.</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS doesn't dump the license file anywhere. It's in the string table and it's not scanned. I've used RTF licenses in the past and they worked fine. I just tried with a 100kb RTF and it loaded instantly. Maybe there's something special about your RTF? Try another one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">make sure you use Wordpad.exe (the one that comes with Windows), not Word, and save as RTF format</p>
