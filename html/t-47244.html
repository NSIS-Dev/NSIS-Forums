The idea of a GUI to build and edit NSI scripts is a good idea.<br><br>Now lets jump out of NSI scripts, and look at HTML (bear with me here). You can do webpages with text editors, or you can use WYSIWYG editors, such as Dreamweaver, and Frontpage. Now, Dreamweaver, has a feature, where you can change what views you want.
