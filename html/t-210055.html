I'm thinking the correct way to do this is to get the window handle in script, set a user variable to hold that value then call my plugin function querying that variable in code with a call to getuservariable.<br><br>This doesn't seem to be working but I am not comletely convinced of that yet. Here is what I've discovered so far. The call to getuservariable in my plugin does return some kind of valid memory address. I can type cast this value to an HWND which as I understand things is what my variable should be holding although it is returned as a "char *". Once casted the HWND still appears to have a valid memory address but when I call any functions to query info about the window from within the plugin I get garbage information, it's all completely wrong which makes me think I don't actually have a valid window handle. Thoughts, suggestions and questions are most welcome.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th March 2005 21:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">There is no need to save the HWND in any variable.

Now I also need to get the device context for a specific control. That seems to be done with a call to GetDC passing the window handle of the control I need to modify. The DC I am returned does seem to be valid however after getting the DC any function I use to apply changes to that DC doesn't seem to do anything. Specifically I've been using the TextOut function which you can read about here...<br><br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdi/fontext_5yd0.asp" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/de...ntext_5yd0.asp</a><br><br>Only it doesn't seem to do anything when I use it.

      </blockquote>Thanks for the feedback everyone. kichik I am slighly unsure at what point you mean to subclass that window. Would this be something like creating a CWnd subclass within my plugin initializing it to have the window handle that I retrieve from the installer and handling the WM_PAINT message there? Maybe I'm totally off track.<br>
