We're doing silent installs using a website I wrote that uses PSExec to kick off silent installs on test systems. The silent install automatically kicks off the uninstaller and then rolls into the installer. We have the fileoverwrite flag set to ifnewer. What's happening is that the delete of files is lagging, and when the file /r gets started, some of the files haven't disappeared yet, and thus NSI says "SKIPPING" and then we end up with an incomplete app out there. It didn't happen at all at first except on one machine. I figure that machine was slower than the rest. Lately it's been happening on all sorts of machines.

      <p class="post-content">No, it did, but I deleted it in the uninstaller. Then when the installer tries to create it, it doesn't seem to fail, but it doesn't create it (unless that's what the (1) means after it tries to create the directory).<br>

      This is getting more confusing, because we've got a different installer that's doing this same thing (saying error creating such and such file), but the files exist after the installer gets done with the new timestamp and everything.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What happens at what time point. Which files are extracted at what time? Which files are deleted at what time? What happens first? Does the uninstaller really finish by the time the installer starts? Does the file exists when the installer tries to extract it? Does the folder exist when the installer tries to put a file in it?

      <p class="post-content">Message boxes won't help because this only happens on silent install. I can see what happens, when, by the log file. The uninstaller doesn't log what it does, but it does log that it finished before the installer starts his work.<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code>Exec: command=""C:\DOCUME~1\efetzer\Local Settings\Temp\Uninst.exe" /S _?=D:\Program Files\MyApp"<br>Exec: success (""C:\DOCUME~1\efetzer\Local Settings\Temp\Uninst.exe" /S _?=D:\Program Files\MyApp")<br>Section: "Install"<br>settings logging to 1<br>logging set to 1<br></code>

      <br>
      The weirdest thing about this is that we had no problems for 5+ months (except occasionally on one machine out of about 200) and then, all of a sudden, it started happening everywhere... I'll add a few pushes to the log as to whether the directory exists or not when it tries to create it and such.

      <p class="post-content">Ant-virus applications employ a slew of tactics to try and protect your system. Some are simple such as scanning every file on the system once a day and some invasive such as scanning a file when it's modified or even monitor file deletions and modifications and filter those on the basis of known viral behaviors. Sometimes, the more invasive operations can be flawed, either by design or by implementation. That could cause problem such as those you're describing.</p>

      </blockquote>Okay Eric, I've had this problem before too. It appears that while the uninstaller is described to work where it doesn't start up another copy of itself when you use the _? parameter, that it still does. All _? does is tell it where to uninstall from.<br>
      <br>
      In order to solve this issue, I've posted the following bit of code I used:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br> function RunPreviousVersionUninstall<br>  <br>  StrCpy $0 "$PROGRAMFILES\MYAPP\uninstall.exe"<br>  ${GetParent} "$0" $5<br>  IfFileExists "$0" copyuninstaller loopend<br>  <br>  copyuninstaller:<br>  CopyFiles /SILENT "$0" "$TEMP\tempuninstall.exe"<br> <br>  setdetailsprint textonly<br>  Exec '"$TEMP\tempuninstall.exe" /S _?=$5'    <br>  StrCpy $2 "Uninstalling Previous Version..." <br>  DetailPrint "$2"<br>  StrCpy $4 ""<br><br>  Sleep 1000<br><br>  loopbegin:<br>    StrLen $5 "$4"<br>    StrCmp $5 "12" 0 +2<br>    StrCpy $4 ""<br>    StrCpy $4 "$4."<br>    StrCpy $3 "$2$4"<br>    DetailPrint "$3"<br>        ${nsProcess::FindProcess} "tempuninstall.exe" $R2<br>        StrCmp "$R2" "0" loopagain<br>        ${nsProcess::FindProcess} "tempuninstall" $R2<br>        StrCmp "$R2" "0" loopagain<br>    goto loopend<br>  loopagain:<br>        sleep 1000<br>        goto loopbegin<br>  loopend:<br>  <br>  setdetailsprint both<br>functionend<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      As you can see I am waiting for the named process to quit, as the uninstaller starts up another copy of itself, with the same name. If you wait until this process has gone away, then the uninstall will be completed. Everyone here told me that _? made the uninstaller run only once, but that's just not true from my experiences.

      <p class="post-content">When you use _?= another process will <b>never</b> be spawned. That can be shown by the following simple script.</p>

      </blockquote>Yeah it doesn't work for me, perhaps it is because I am using it silently as well. However in my case I used the time waiting around, to do something so it's not something I considered a huge issue for me. However I did ask around about it, and everyone just re-iterated the help file, which I can read all by myself (thank you,) and until I figured out that _? wasn't working for me as documented, has exactly the same problems Erik is describing.

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I'm still getting the same thing with the patch off. Looks like we've got something going since I've been gone. I'm really happy about that because this is kicking my butt!!!! Let me know kichik if I should do 9 9's workaround. I'm hoping not because I would have to do it in about 400 places. Thanks - Eric</p>

      <p class="post-content">When i ran it locally - &gt;test /S, it worked fine. The difference being that when I have these problems, I'm using PSEXEC to kick off the exe's in silent mode from another server. I won't be able to see the popups if I run from PSEXEC, so I'll have to figure out a way to modify the test code to show order without needing human intervention. Can you think of a way to do this kichik?</p>

      I believe that shows that the two files aren't being kicked off at the same time, and thus, that the:<br>

      <br>
      is working as designed.<br>
      <br>
      But then again, we haven't had the error we usually get in the past week. Could be that the Systems group has done something that we are unaware of to this machine. I'll investigate.

      So, I'm thinking that we're barking down the completely wrong path (my dog does that a lot also). One thing that is always the case. It fails creating a folder, and thus, it doesn't write any files to that folder. The only reason I can think of for it not being able to create the folder is because it still thinks the folder is there. So maybe it got deleted in the uninstall, but it's so lightning fast (in silent mode because of the lack of interaction), that the OS lies to NSIS saying that the folder is already there. What if I put a 5 second sleeper at the end of all of my uninstalls to give the OS time to catch up? I'll give it a shot and report back.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Putting a sleeper is never the right solution. It just hides the problem a bit better. If "lighting fast" suddenly become over 5 seconds because the CPU or HD are really busy, it won't be able to hide it.<br>
        <br>
        Try verifying it's the right tree first by validating the folder exists in the installer. Use IfFileExists.</p>

        </blockquote>I also found this to be the case, it's some odd thing about the uninstaller/installer interaction.<br>
        <br>
        Starting from a clean build the following were the different states after installs:<br>
        <br>
        Install #1: Full install, completely successful<br>
        Install #2: Uninstall previous version, and then attempt an installation. Installation failed, because the install directory could not be created.<br>
        Install #3: Full install, (because there is no previous installation,) completely successful.<br>
        <br>
        And round and round it goes. I have a couple ideas, but basically it appeared to me that the issue was related to the current installer having it's installation directory deleted, *after* it already had assumed it was there, and was ready to use.<br>
        <br>
        The solution I used to prove myself more or less right, was to execute a batch file which created the directory, after ruuning the uninstall. It worked perfectly after I did that. As a result, I added a function to our custom plugin to handle this instead.

        <p class="post-content">I don't think I've ever had a problem with the installation directory, only subdirectories that are in the File /r command. I don't specifically tell the installer to create the directories, just let it do it when it copies them in.<br>
        <br>
        There's something that is causing me to switch gears though. When it fails (not really fails, but in the deploy log I see it error on creating a directory), if I run the installer manually it works (even with the /S option). I'm investigating whether PSExec has issues with permissions possibly (seems ludicrous because I'm admin on the machine and it doesn't have problems creating all directories, just one or another).</p>

        <p class="post-content">I'd say it's time for some debugging...<br>
        <br>
        Attached is a set of stubs (for 2.31) that'd simply break into the debugger upon directory creation failure. Use them build an installer that'd be installed using psExec. On the computer where the installer is executed, install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx" target="_blank">windbg</a> and set it as the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/121434" target="_blank">postmortem debugger</a>. Now execute the installer using psExec and hope the magic psExec does doesn't block windbg from your desktop.<br>
        <br>
        Once windbg is open, at the very least create a crash dump using <i>.dump /ma C:\CreateDirectoryFailed.dmp</i> and post it here.</p>

        <p class="post-content">OK, this sucks!!! So I got the opportunity and did what I said I was going to. The build failed. So I set the debug stubs up and rebuilt. This time, however, everything worked fine. This caused me to dig a little deeper into why the redeploy's aren't working. Well it turns out that when I redeploy with PSEXEC, it is working. It isn't showing us that it's working because our log isn't allowing itself to be overwritten silently. So I'm going to have to catch it when it happens the first time or I won't catch it.<br>
        <br>
        Is it safe to do create a debug exe everytime for just this one test environment? In other words, as a part of my build process, when I was building the exe for the test environment, have the build copy the stubs in there, run makensis, then copy the working stubs back over for creating all the other exe's...<br>
        <br>
        Of course I also want to address the log issue, but that's another subject...<br>

        <p class="post-content">It's perfectly safe to move over the stubs as long as you replace makensis.exe along with them.</p>

        <p class="post-content">I must be doing this wrong. I never understood having to replace makensis.exe. I only changed out the stubs. I was under the impression that those stubs went with the version you had told me to upgrade with. Is there a step that I missed?</p>

        <p class="post-content">Right, I gave you stubs that match makensis.exe 2.31 built with logging. As long as you switch between the normal logging stubs and the special logging stubs, makensis.exe can stay the same. But if you switch to non-logging stubs or another version of stubs, you'll have to switch makensis.exe.</p>

        <p class="post-content"><strong>Not working...</strong><br>
        When the folder create fails, the psexec process doesn't hang. I'm guessing that these stubs aren't dumping. Should I put some sort of code in my nsi file for debug purposes to force a dump?</p>

        <p class="post-content">I believe as it creates the folder, it says (err=5), and thereafter cannot create files in that folder that doesn't exist. If this isn't the case, I'll cut, paste, and post when it happens again.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Are you sure the executed installer was created with the stubs I gave you? I see no reason it'd ignore a call to DebugBreak(), even when executed with psexec. Open the installer with notepad or some text editor and look for DebugBreak.</p>

        <p class="post-content">I believe we've fixed it (no problems for 2 weeks). It looks like IIS was sometimes blocking the installer from deleting folders. So instead of doing an "IISRESET" after the installer is done, we now do an "IISRESET /STOP" in .onInit and then an "IISRESET /START" after the installer is done.<br>
        <br>
        BTW - I checked it out and the move of those stub files was failing in NAnt. Probably a typo in folder name on my part, but we won't need it this time. I'll look deeper if we need this again though.<br>
