      <p class="post-content"><strong>Uninstaller Error</strong><br />
      I've written a installer and everything works fine untill I run the uninstaller from one of my office workstations running Win2Kpro. It runs fine from my home machine with XP and it even runs fine from an old Win95 machine but the 3 office computers with 2kpro causes the folowing message:<br />
      <br />
      "A~NSISu_.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows. You will need to restart the program. An Error log is being created."<br />
      <br />
      The uninstall seems to work but it just generates that message and closes the uninstaller. Can anyone tell me what causes this and how to correct it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure what I can post that will help. If I knew where the error log was written I would post that, I can't post the actual .nsi script untill later. I've attached the uninstaller (since .exe isn't a valid extention for attachments I hope .7z works for you.) As I said before, the 3 machines are all Windows 2000pro (SP4.) All 3 have 128mb memory and 2 are Celeron 600 mhz and 1 is a PIII 1ghz.<br />
      <br />
      If there is anything else I can post to help let me know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS version and the complete error text (if there's a more details button, click it). A Dr. Watson log would also help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS 2.0 (sorry, forgot to include the obvious.)<br />
      <br />
      The only message it gives me is:<br />
      <br />
      A~NSISu_.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows. You will need to restart the program.<br />
      <br />
      An error log is being created.<br />
      <br />
      and then there is an ok button that closes out the installer though windows closes it out anyway after a few seconds. I don't know where any other error logs are.<br />
      <br />
      I tried several other NSIS uninstallers and they work flawless. Could I be missing somthing on the compiling computer?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, it might be a problem with the uninstall script and it might be something else. I can't know for sure without more details about the nature of this error. Can you generate a Dr. Watson log?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry it's taken me this long to get back to this but I've been out in the field and am just now back on one of the suspect machines.<br />
      <br />
      Dr. Watson shows no errors. I've triple checked to make sure it's the defualt debugger (drwtsn32 -i is the correct command right?) I deleted all the old log and created a new one and other than the M$ copyright info, it's still blank after a few tries.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well then, nothing left but the script. Try narrowing it down and attach the simplest possible example.</p>
