      <br />
      The point is, that maybe some player got serious Problems using this here, cause they cant speal (or read/write) english as good as other Members here. Thats the point. I created a sub-Forum, you are welcome to register ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I had set up this Sub-Forum for NSIS-Support in German now. I already set up one Tutorial in German Language on the main Website of NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe you can edit the Page 8http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Community) and enter the Link to the German Support. Thanks</p>

      I do speak and read German very well, I'll would not consider looking on a german only forum, due to the fact statisticly the forum has less information.<br />
      <br />
      I think it is great you want to be of help for NSIS but a separate forum... well it's up to you but I thing better invest some of your time in learning English, this is always benificial.</p>

      <p class="post-content">its up to you. If you dont want to register and talk in german, than i think you are welcome in this board here.<br />
      <br />
      I only saw that there are some other Communyties. (Spanish and anotherone) but they are offline.<br />
      <br />
      So i thought it would be great to create a german one. Ok. Its not the "real" main forum, but i think there is enough space to talk about nsis. (this forum only have one sub forum, too)<br />
      <br />
      I also searched for developers who are able to recode my forum, so i am able to store syntax highlighted code in a dbase.<br />
      <br />
      If you want come and talk, if you want to discuss on english, do it here.<br />

      <p class="post-content">ok...which NSIS sub-forums do you mean? If i click the link on nsis.sf.net to the forum, i will be placed here.<br />
      <br />
      (if you mean you cant see a sub forum for the supports, its up that i placed it into "Projekte" in a category which is visible for registered users only. I will edit that as far as the new hack is installed. (changing category stuff atm)</p>
