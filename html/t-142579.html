I wasn't sure if there is a reason to not let your users see exactly what files your app is using or not. If the DLL is in your application folder, then they know what your app uses. If the DLL is in the system folder, then the user has no idea that your app uses it because they can't find it...easily. Is there any opinions on that???</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th July 2003 23:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">If the DLL is not shared, put it in your application folder.<br><br>I don't see why you should "hide" the files for the user. Any user who would want to know which files your application uses can easily check the dependencies. I also don't think there is any reason why the user should not know the filenames.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
