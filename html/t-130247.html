      <p class="post-content">Ok, this is happening when trying to create the plugins directory, to extract a plugin dll. The EW_GETTEMPFILENAME opcode gets a temp filename like this:<br>
      <br>
      GetTempFileName(temp_directory,"nst",0,textout))<br>
      <br>
      On NT4, subsequent calls to this API will generate filenames with ascending sequence numbers, like this:<br>
      <br>
      C:\TEMP\nst1.tmp<br>
      C:\TEMP\nst2.tmp<br>
      C:\TEMP\nst3.tmp<br>
      etc..<br>
      <br>
      Now, say that C:\TEMP\nst3.tmp does not get deleted for some reason. (e.g. setup gets interrupted.) After a reboot, the sequence numbers will start again at 1. If GetTempFileName is called 3 times, it will try to create "C:\TEMP\nst3.tmp" again.<br>
      <br>
      On later versions of Windows, if nst3.tmp exists, GetTempFileName would skip to the next sequence number, and try to create nst4.tmp. However on NT4, if the file exists, and it is a directory (which in this case it is), it will try to create nst3.tmp, and fail with an Access Denied, because it is already there. The result is that the plugin does not get extracted, and fails to load.<br>
      <br>
      If you call GetTempFileName again, it will try the next sequence number, "C:\TEMP\nst4.tmp", which will succeed. So in my fix above, I just call GetTempFileName repeatedly until it works, and bail out after 100 iterations to prevent a possible hang.<br>
      <br>
      Hope this clarifies it. If not, let me know :)</p>

      <br></p>

      <blockquote>
        If uUnique is zero, the function attempts to form a unique file name using the current system time. If the file already exists, the number is increased by one and the functions tests if this file already exists. This continues until a unique filename is found; the function creates a file by that name and closes it. Note that the function does not attempt to verify the uniqueness of the file name when uUnique is nonzero.
      </blockquote>Even though, I'll check.

      I dropped the following code in, replacing the EW_GETTEMPFILENAME case with:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>    case EW_GETTEMPFILENAME:<br>      {<br>        char *textout=var0;<br>        int n = 100;<br>        while (n--)<br>          if (GetTempFileName(temp_directory,"nst",0,textout))<br>            return 0;<br>        g_flags.exec_error++;<br>        *textout=0;<br>      }<br>    return 0;<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      The behavior is only slightly modified - NOT fixed. When doing the install-with-reboot followed immediately by an install again (still on NT4), it now gets one complete cycle without any problems... but on the third install (so we are saying install-with-reboot ... install-with-reboot ... install-attempt -&gt; error), we get the same error with "\\ioSpecial.ini" and the abort-retry-ignore dialog. With the original version of the temp-file code, it fails on the SECOND install.<br>
      <br>
      I do still go along with the idea that this has <i>something</i> to do with temp files/folders... it just wasn't quite this simple. :(<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      A question for you and kickik: when I was looking at the project settings in VS6 prior to doing the new build (based on my BETA "3a" sources that came with that release), I noticed that the SINGLE-threaded C libraries are being used... I am not sure <b>I</b> would be brave enough to build this way but still spawn and execute additional threads!:eek:<br>
      <br>
      I wonder if this has anything to do with that reported SMP problem where the user never followed up ("[ 676056 ] Currupted Exe's with SMP machines")? Threading problems are notorious for not showing up until you actually run on a multi-processor machine, given that most of us still develop and test on uni-processor. ;)<br>
      <br>
      Let me know if I can run any more tests for you, but be aware of one thing - the makensis.exe that I built is ~3KB larger than the "release" BETA 3 version! I run VS6 with SP5 AND the latest Platform SDK, so <b>something</b> about this environment is causing the difference, even though I only changed the above source and no project settings.

      <br>
      Anyway, things look ugly regarding that NSIS build-installer-time error I reported in my last post... my script compiles fine with the released Beta 3 version, but with today's CVS version, it does NOT. What is more disturbing (to me, anyway) is that relatively minor random changes in the script cause the error to change:<br>
      <br>
      <b>could not resolve label "t_init" in function "un.Initialize_____Plugins"</b><br>
      <br>
      changes to messed-up forms of other labels in the either MY script or your [MUI] scripts. Really. :weird:<br>
      <br>
      What is happening is that AFTER the Uninstall section is processed, NSIS then spits out<br>
      <br>
      <b>Processed 1 file, writing output:<br>
      Adding plug-ins initializing function... setting uninstall mode to true<br>
      Done!</b><br>
      <br>
      immediately before a complaint about <i>some</i> script label... I think that the error above is about the label "reboot_init" from the MUI scripts. I can make the error shift to complaining about a label in one of my macros being instantiated in an uninstaller function, ALSO with characters dropped from the front. :(<br>
      <br>
      To answer your question, other simpler scripts work fine - your examples or some test scripts of mine. I will attach my script since you ask, but it is 353 lines and refers [of course] to an EXE and a DLL of mine. ;)</p>

      <br>
      where "d:\Help" is a folder that I expect to be recursively included in the installer, and then expanded to "$OUTDIR\Help". This works fine (compilation and execution) with Beta "3a", but with the current CVS Beta 4 causes the spurious<br>
