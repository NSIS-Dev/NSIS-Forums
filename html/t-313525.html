      <p class="post-content"><strong>This program might not have installed correctly.</strong><br />
      I'm getting this error message when I reinstall my app in Windows Vista. It appears after I close the installer once it's finished.<br />
      <br />
      "This program might not have installed correctly."<br />
      <br />
      This only appears when I reinstall while it's already installed. It doesn't happen on the first install and if I uninstall and reinstall I don't get this message.<br />
      <br />
      Is there anyway to figure out why this message is appearing? Vista doesn't give any information other than that message.</p>

      <p class="post-content">We are getting the same error in our installer, but only on a reinstall, and yes, we have Admin as the required level. We do write to the registry for the ARP, but I guess because it is a reinstall, it is writing out the exact same thing.<br />
      <br />
      Do we need to do registry shenanigans to solve this? Write some random string just so Windows doesn't stroke out?</p>

      <p class="post-content">hm, maybe add/update the "InstallDate" would work, at least if windows is hashing the data the hash should change<br />
      <br />
      and if not, maybe ask over @ <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/</a></p>

      My "problem" was something like this: I had string "install" mentioned in the file properties Description field (it was actually a part of a bigger word: "installation"), Win7 found it *after* running the exe. The exe wasn't an (un)installer, so Win7 thought something was wrong. I removed the word and error didn't appear anymore. Was pretty hard to figure out..</p>
