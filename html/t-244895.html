      the images are changed by a droplist event<br>
      <br>
      with wansis:<br>
      if i change the images too fast with the mouse wheel .. then the installer simply quits<br>
      it's enough to scroll up or down several items in the list by moving the mouse wheel relatively fast<br>
      <br>
      without wansis:<br>
      if i scroll like crazy for about 30 seconds then the image dissapears and same thing happens to all the other images in the installer [i.e. on the welcome/finish screen]

      <p class="post-content">Not sure why you need the code to get the image size. You can just use 0 for the width and height when you want to use the original dimensions when using LoadImage (just like I have done in the code that you requested).<br>

      the image is from outside of the installer<br>

      <p class="post-content">:) thanx for the script<br>
      but the problem is not the image size<br>
      i have the image size and also have made the code to scale down the image to fit in 320x180 pixels because i will use images of any size<br>
      <br>
      but the problem is that the installer seems to have some problems when i change the image using a droplist event<br>
      <br>
      with or without wansis<br>
      <br>
      with wansis it's more dificult because the installer exits for no reason<br>
      <br>
      without wansis if i change the droplist [eachs change causes the image to change also]after a while all the images from the installer are gone [incl. those from welcome/finish pages]<br>
      <br>
      so i susspect there is a problem with my code<br>
      maybe i have smth wrong with image handles ...<br>
      <br>
      i have posted the code because i am not sure i have the correct commands for closing the handle ..<br>
      <br>
      thanx in advance :)</p>

</pre><br>
      <br>
      now it's a little strange<br>
      the images r dissapearing like before<br>
      exept a few of them from the droplist [2 maybe 3]<br>
      <br>
      also .. no image appears at the first run [on page show]<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      i have 40-60 items in the drolist so i have to read 40-60 different bitmap images<br>
      images are read each time i change the droplist<br>
      <br>
      maybe i chenge too fast with the mouse wheel so the system diesn;t have time to do all the commands<br>
      <br>
      do you think it would be usefull to add a delay timer of about 100 miliseconds?<br>
      like Sleep 100<br>
      [to give time to the system to do the comands and close the handle aswell]

      <p class="post-content">ah yes ... true<br>
      but the image remains on the screen untill a another window gets over and then the image dissapears<br>
      <br>
      but i have observed that it seems my used memory increases during this operation [changing the droplist]<br>
      but it gets nowhere near 50% ...<br>
      <br>
      on task manager i have the setup using abou 3-4 megs maximum<br>
      <br>
      but the page file usage increases a lot .. 100-200 megs maybe more</p>

      <p class="post-content">oh, i have observed smth interesting<br>
      <br>
      at the first display of each of the bmp images, all is ok<br>
      no increase in memory usage or page file usage [not even by a bit]<br>
      <br>
      but then on the second display it starts to increase pf usage<br>
      third disply of the same picture same increase ... and so on<br>
      <br>
      so at some point the hard disk starts to roll and the images dissapear<br>
      after 5-6 displays of all 60 pictures<br>
      <br>

      but the problem with wansis still remains<br>
      setup exits if i rapidly change the droplist<br>

      wansis is not skining the droplist<br>
      is this a wansis problem?
