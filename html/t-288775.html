      </blockquote>Hello,<br />
      <br />
      I found in the features of wiki follow:<br />
      - Installers can be as large as 2GB<br />
      <br />
      I use the installer only on WinXP and Vista and do not need<br />
      Win9x support, so it is no problem when file larger than 2 GB.

      <p class="post-content">Instead of creating one huge file you can store the data in multiple compressed files. Then there will also be no issues with filesystems that do not support files larger than 2GB.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, you could accomplish this by breaking some of your files off into a second installer from the first. The second install could be run silently. This way your files still get compressed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm just curious about how the MultiVolume would work. When you run the first installer from the first CD, then are prompted to take out the first CD and enter the second, wouldn't that cause a problem since you are still executing the first installer from the first CD? Maybe I'm mistaken though.<br />
      <br />
      Would it need to do something like:<br />
      If Current EXE is on CD<br />
      {<br />
      copy exe to tempfilename<br />
      exe tempfilename<br />
      quit<br />
      }<br />
      Else<br />
      {<br />
      continue with install as usual<br />
      }<br />
      <br />
      Maybe that's done already, but I scanned through the code and didn't see anything that accomplished that.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: I'm not trying to be critical of it, just thinking there is something I probably don't understand.</p>
