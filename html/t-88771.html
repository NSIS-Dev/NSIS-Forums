      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS 2.0 Feature Request</strong><br />
      Another feature request for NSIS 2.0:<br />
      <br />
      The ability to have multiple user-defined installer pages called. Similar to InstallOptions, but without using the InstallOptions DLL or ini file.<br />
      <br />
      I recommend that it be a compile-in feature that isn't enabled by default, as most installers most likely wouldn't use it. As for getting information about how the dialog should be created, I would lean towards using the stack.<br />
      <br />
      I'm going to start working on implimenting this into the current build of NSIS, but really like to see it done as a standard feature.<br />
      <br />
      I'd really like to hear thoughts and ideas about this. Thanks.<br />

      <p class="post-content">That's exactly my feeling. For a feature that a bunch of people use all the time, I feel that it should be incorporated. And along those same lines, if you need that feature, you can just re-compile it in, add a couple two k or so at most probably, and you're good go. Where as with the current solution, you need to and 11.5k dll (i got it down to 8k though), a 1k ini file (negotiable depending on the complexity of your dialog), as well as support in the installer to call external dlls, support for ini files, and support for temporary filenames (as recommended by the samples.<br />
      <br />
      It seems like a logical step to incorporate this, so that the size will go down, and the feature is always there.<br />
      <br />
      Just my two cents.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I agree, as soon as your setup gets a little more complex than copying a couple of files, you need one or more pages with checkboxes, radiobuttons, comboboxes, etc... Maybe it could even be generalized so that ALL pages can be defined that way?</p>

      InstallOptions is great, if it/it's functionality was integrated into NSIS, that would be very useful.<br />
      <br />
      I would have to bug somebody to compile it for me though if it was a compile time option. Or learn how to sompile it myself - I could learn, but I'd rather not: seems like a chore since I'm not going to dev. NSIS. Oh well. ;)</p>
