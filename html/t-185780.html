      <p class="post-content">Hi Mic84, and welcome to the forums :)<br />
      <br />
      Hum, did you check the AdvSplash readme (Contrib\AdvSplash\advsplash.txt)? There is the following code in it, did you try it?<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        Function .onInit<br />
        SetOutPath $TEMP<br />
        File /oname=spltmp.bmp "my_splash.bmp"<br />
        <br />
        ; optional<br />
        ; File /oname=spltmp.wav "my_splashshit.wav"<br />
        <br />
        advsplash::show 1000 600 400 -1 $TEMP\spltmp<br />
        <br />
        Pop $0 ; $0 has '1' if the user closed the splash screen early,<br />
        ; '0' if everything closed normal, and '-1' if some error occured.<br />
        <br />
        Delete $TEMP\spltmp.bmp<br />
        ; Delete $TEMP\spltmp.wav<br />
        FunctionEnd

      <p class="post-content">Ooooops, it seems that at the end of the working week I can't even read properly, sorry about that :p<br />
      <br />
      Well, then to play some music during the whole installation, check the plugin 'BgImage', there is a .txt and a nice example in 'Contrib\BgImage' ..<br />
      <br />
      Hope you'll make it :)<br />

          You should say your NSIS, Windows versions first. You only need to attach the script if you think it's a script problem, because it should work.<br /></b>
        </blockquote>Looking from my corner Video for Windows Win API is good enough for WAVE files, MSDN declares it's support beginning Win95 :)<br />
        <br />
        Windows NT: Requires version 3.1 or later.<br />
        Windows: Requires Windows 95 or later.<br />
        Windows CE: Requires version 2.0 or later.<br />
        Header: Declared in mmsystem.h.<br />
        Import Library: Use winmm.lib.<br />
        <br />
        mp3 files - this depends... :)<br />
        <br />
        Problems with splash plugin were on Win98 SE. Bitmap OK, sound :( And I guess any case plugin for wav file increases installation size only. I tested my script on Win98/W2K/XP and it worked fine. The only problem was with sound file extraction to plugins dir on Win98 (file /oname, cannot open file for write error), but after I did it in 2 lines with SetOutPath this is OK. Regards.

        <p class="post-content">Thank for all evilO!<br />
        <br />
        It works fine with the BgImage!<br />
        All i had to do was put this code in the .onInit function:<br />
        <br />
        InitPluginsDir<br />
        BgImage::Sound /NOUNLOAD /LOOP "path of the wav file"<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        PS: Does anybody knows how to remove the label "Nullsoft Install System v2.0" on the bottom of each installation window ???<br />
        Is this allowed to do?<br />
        <br />
        Thanks all<br />

            Sincerely, someone should create a Archive page of this issue of playing music. I don't create one because I don't like the Archive at all.
