Generally you would not want to preserve anything other than User settings which the program would save in the user's home dir (assuming a multi-user env). I don't see how there would be more overhead required.. in the one case (the old case) I would just file by file list the files I wish to remove in the uninstall section, in the other case the uninstaller does this implicitly through one instruction. If the implementer does not use this instruction, then uninstaller would not need to keep track of the installed files. If you really did want to separate program settings and dlls as far as your uninstaller is concirned.. all you would need to do is put the two in differnt sections, or not use this feature.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd May 2003 18:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I plan to create a plug-in that will help you achieve such a behavior once I add plug-ins support for the compiler.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">hermanator</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd July 2003 20:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Any movement on this front?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd July 2003 13:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Not yet, and I'm afraid it won't be any time soon.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">fabiochelly</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th February 2004 13:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">In fact, this is a logical problem for those who come from Innosetup.<br>Innosetup is very less powerful than NSIS but the scripts are very small and easier to create.<br>When I try to convice them to change IS for NSIS, they answer me that NSIS is too complex and that it is boring to specify each file twice (one time for install and one time ofr uninstall): the program should be able to calculate automatically the uninstall section from the other sections.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
