I saw a couple of things that was interesting 'bout the UI used in the installer:<br>1) It had a dialog box for entering admin username and pass if i tried to install as a non-admin. How do you get that dialog box ?<br><br>2) The installation progress was a very modern and pretty UI. How was that made possible? Was it some MUI2 stuff working here?

And yeah i didnt realize it didnt ask for install location...that sucks pretty much although it installed on my d: which has program files.<br><br>Heres what i saw stepwise on my machine when i was a guest user:<br>1)<br><a href="http://i34.tinypic.com/fmjc6f.jpg" target="_blank">http://i34.tinypic.com/fmjc6f.jpg</a><br><br>2)I try installing as a guest user:<br><a href="http://i36.tinypic.com/rlg9ia.jpg" target="_blank">http://i36.tinypic.com/rlg9ia.jpg</a><br><br>3)Error to install(obviously):<br><a href="http://i37.tinypic.com/2ufsw83.jpg" target="_blank">http://i37.tinypic.com/2ufsw83.jpg</a><br><br>4)The installer then restarts and now i add admin information:<br><a href="http://i34.tinypic.com/o73kgm.jpg" target="_blank">http://i34.tinypic.com/o73kgm.jpg</a><br><br>5)The pretty part of the installation:<br><a href="http://i36.tinypic.com/t0oubq.jpg" target="_blank">http://i36.tinypic.com/t0oubq.jpg</a><br><br>How can we give a similar dialog box(in 2 and 4) to the user in nsis? This can be helpful in the way that user wont have to logout/switch user etc to admin account to install the thing.<br>Thanks LoRd_MuldeR for the info \m/</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Anders</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st July 2008 10:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><a href="http://i36.tinypic.com/rlg9ia.jpg" target="_blank">http://i36.tinypic.com/rlg9ia.jpg</a><br>Is not part of the installer, its a part of windows (Windows will try to detect installers by looking at the filename, contains "install" or "setup" etc.)<br><br>So, name your installer with one of the keywords in the name, or use the UAC plugin</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
