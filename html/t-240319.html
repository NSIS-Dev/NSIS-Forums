The executable you are attempting to run has been corrupted. Please obtain another file of the copy, verify its integrity and then try again." Then i tried to install xfire and it said the file was corrupted and gave me the NSIS error. I cant download bit comet, NSIS errors pops up. I know that every file i have downloaded cannot be corrupted, so it is something else.<br>and yes i have tried downloading from other sites, and same problem. Also my other computer downloads the files fine</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kwkossick</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th March 2006 03:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I swear my problem has to do with windows and not the downloaded file.

Bad system memory can also cause this problem.

Ive determined this is definetly a hardware problem, at least in my case. Ive already removed both my RAM chips and no fix. While its possible that its a hard drive error i seriously doubt it since this appears to be the only thing affected, although occasionaly ill look at a pic online or even one ive downloaded in the past which worked fine untill i got my brand spanking new athlon x2 64 3800 which is when this problem started (im about to pull out a different HDD and test this theory and ill post the results). My guess is that, at least in my case, there is a problem with either my mother board or my processor. Maybe this info can help, or if someone else who has the mind to think outside the box has a better solution please post it. Also please post at least the general hardware info (proccessor, mother board, ram type/size/brand, video card, hard drive (type ex. sata, ide, etc.) knowing whats inside the computer greatly helps when diagnosing a problem.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Comperio</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd March 2006 05:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Sometimes, I've found that an incorrect BIOS setting can appear to be "faulty hardware".
