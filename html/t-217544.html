      <p class="post-content"><strong>Patch to enable canceling during file copy</strong><br />
      I really needed to allow users to cancel an installation while it's copying files. I know this is on the TODO list for a future NSIS release, but I couldn't wait. It only took a few changes to the installer stub -- the patch is attached.<br />
      <br />
      You have to specifically enable the Cancel button if you want it (I didn't want to break existing installers). For example:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>Section<br />  ; Enable CANCEL button<br />  GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 2<br />  EnableWindow $0 1<br />SectionEnd<br /></code>
</pre>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, I got this working although I never figured out the correct way to use the txt file as a patch. I ended up just copying and pasting the changes in as needed. It worked fine under 2.06 and I was also able to modify it a little to get it working in 2.0 since that's the version I'm currently sending everything out in. Good job. I've been wanting this not because I thought it should be there but because my QA department keeps pointing it out. We've also had a few calls from customers.</p>

      </blockquote>Aborting an installation may leave a mess behind, but you've got to consider the alternative. I've got a large installation that can take 10 minutes to complete. If I didn't provide some way for users to bail out, they'll bring up Task Manager and start nuking random processes.

      One outstanding problem is that you still can't cancel during extraction of big files. It'll be great if you can resolve this in your patch. However, I'll probably include the current patch as an option, even if you don't.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can't get NSIS patched. I need the cancel button, but can't figure out how to get this patch installed.<br />
      <br />
      I tried to use patch.exe from <a href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a> with no success. I tried to modify the NSIS source code manually, but my compiler is screwed and gives me error messages.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone have any suggestions on how to get this working?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">I gather that this is something that has not made it into NSIS yet. We were just looking into this exact issue and you cannot cancel during the file copy.</p>
