I am right now in the progress of updating the danish translation both for the application itself and the installer. However some strings are not local to eMule and part of the NSIS installer I have found. :)<br><br>Problem is that I don't really like part of the danish translation but not really sure what to do from here. Is the danish translation still being maintained or is the translator gone? The eMule developer that takes care of translations thought it was best if I contact the NSIS project instead of just doing a local update on his installation. Any views on this? :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd May 2007 16:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Normally it goes through the official translator which is Claus Futtrup in this case. However, I can't find any contact method for him. It'd be best if you could catch him.<br><br>What kind of changes are we talking about? Small typos or a complete overhaul? If it's just a couple of typos or spelling errors, they could be fixed without him.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">birk</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd May 2007 17:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well based on what I could see from the latest eMule installer it is more than a few minor fixes but most likely not a complete overhaul either. There are some words that are present throughout the translations that I think should be changed and many words that that are written as two but should be one. Is this the translator? :)<br><a href="http://home1.stofanet.dk/cfuttrup/about/about_me.htm" target="_blank">http://home1.stofanet.dk/cfuttrup/about/about_me.htm</a></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">birk</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd May 2007 17:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">hxxp://home1.stofanet.dk/cfuttrup/about/about_me.htm<br><br>Link didn't work. :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd May 2007 17:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">He has the same name, but I can't tell if it's the same person.

I just want to make sure that I appreciate all your hard work with the translation. It is nice that some will take the time to translate a program to a new language which makes it so much easier for only native speakers to use great software. :up:<br><br>Well like I said in the first I am updating all the danish eMule translations atm which is a huge project infact. The main language file is a little less than 2000 lines which leaves maybe around 1400-1500 lines for translation. :( Because of this I would like to help with the NSIS installer aswell because using all that time and then leaving the installer behind would be a bit sad I think. I hope you agree.<br><br>I have downloaded both danish translation files from the CVS just now. Claus what do say to this proposition. I translate the language files how I want them and then I can send them to you for your revision and we can discuss any changes you might have? Is that fine with you? :)<br><br>@ kichik<br>Are there used strings from both the .nlf and .nsh in an installer that used the modern UI? Just want to make sure. :)<br><br>Kind Regards,<br>birk</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th May 2007 12:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yes, both the NLF and the NSH strings are used in Modern UI installers.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">cfuttrup</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th May 2007 10:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by birk</i><br>I have downloaded both danish translation files from the CVS just now.

I'm not so deep into this software so my comments will probably (for the most part) be about official danish computer expressions - and about spell checking (I hope that's OK - it's always good with a second pair of eyes to catch 'em typos).<br><br>... well, you may as well get this link right now:<br>http://www.klid.dk/dansk/ordlister/ordliste.html<br><br>(you don't have to stick to it 100% - but I think it can be a good help)<br><br>Best regards,<br>Claus</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">birk</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th May 2007 12:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">That is fine with me.
