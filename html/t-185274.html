      <p class="post-content"><strong>short filenames in destination folder</strong><br />
      I can't figure why this is happening, but I get short filenames in the destination folder field (of the MUI). For example, C:\PROGRA~1\TASKTR~1. Full filenames are only appearing after browsing for a folder. Script attached.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Let's try that again. But anyway, the issue is not present on another system, so maybe it's not NSIS-specific.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe that was it. I can't say positively because the problem has gone away for now on the original system. I browsed to the directory, and this problably reset the key. It's correct now. If it recurs, I will check it again.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know that on XP you can turn off the 8.3 filename support within the OS. It speeds up disk access considerably (almost 35%) since the OS doesn't have to create 8.3 filenames for each of the files it is writing to disk. Perhaps, on the system you are using the creation of 8.3 headers was disabled.</p>
