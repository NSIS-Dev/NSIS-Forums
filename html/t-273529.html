When these executables are called, they open up shell windows as they register themselves as windows services.<br><br>Now this works great as a normal install, but since I've added the silent installation code, the service registration doesn't work.<br><br>All of the files are copied over, but I'm wondering if they are not registering as services because they would need to spawn shells to work, or ExecWait doesn't function as I expect it to work when the installation is run as silent.<br><br>Does anyone have any hints for me to work around this issue?<br><br>Thanks in advance.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">28th June 2007 11:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Are you sure it's because you are running a silent install?

The problem is because I was triggering the ExecWait from a page callback.
