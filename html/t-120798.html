      <p class="post-content"><strong>Running a file that is packed in the installer</strong><br />
      Please let me know if this is possible:<br />
      <br />
      During installation, I wish to get inputs from the user and pass these inputs to a file (<i>packed within the installer - meaning to say this is a file which has been compiled within the installer and would be copied to the target machine after validation</i>) for validation.<br />
      <br />
      The validation process would require the execution of an external/3rd party application (which can be assumed to exist on the target machine).<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone have any idea if this can be done and How can it be done?<br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Use Exec, ExecWait, ExecShell or nsExec (a plug-in). I would recommend making that executable a plug-in if it's for validation only, will be faster.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi, I reckon the use of Exec is feasible however, may I know how do it refer to the file that is packed within the installer? As it has yet to be copied into the target machine, $INSTDIR won't work, would it?<br />
      <br />
      As of now I am still not able to make the file into an executable plugin, so I believe I do not have it as an option yet.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      Extract it to $PLUGINSDIR (initialize it first using InitPluginsDir), and execute it from there. It will be automatically deleted when the installer finishes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I guess this may be a stupid question, but may I know how do I extract a particular file to the PLUGINSDIR?<br />

      <p class="post-content">SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
      File thefilename.exe<br />
      <br />
      or this may even work...<br />
      <br />
      File /oname="$PLUGINSDIR/thefilename.exe" thefilename.exe<br />
      <br />
      I don't have time to check these but you get the general idea. The File command both includes a file AND extracts it, it has a different meaning to makensis than when it is running in the compiled installer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Should be:<br />
      <br />
      File "/oname=$PLUGINSDIR/thefilename.exe" thefilename.exe<br />
      <br />
      SetOutPath works too.<br />
      <br />
      Just don't forget to use InitPluginsDir first.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the response.<br />
      However, it seems like only SetOutPath works for me.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="orangered">File "/oname=$PLUGINSDIR/thefilename.exe" thefilename.exe</font><br />
      doesn't work.<br />
      <br />
      But since something works.I am fine. Thanks. :)</p>
