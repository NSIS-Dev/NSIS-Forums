If you have only simple installers you have just to check the message boxes (see NSIS help).<br><br>ad 2) Yes, see NSIS help for silent mode (/D).<br><br>ad 3) You can't call a section directly. You can disable/enable any installer pages (directory selection, welcome screen), at a minimum you need INSTFILES.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">RossW</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th June 2006 14:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Just to be clear, I can run an install script directly (with licence page 'I Agree' button') but also silently where that page will be bypassed?<br><br>Also, if I add code to the Directory page's Leave function to call the individual installers in silent mode, how do I determine which 'components' the user checked?

The "silent mode" can be set by NSIS script (compile time/run time) and/or by command line option. No page will show up if the installer is in silent mode.<br><br>You cannot/should not drop install code in the Leave function because Leave is a call back and will (?) not be called in silent mode. It is bad behaviour, too. All code which effectively installs files or settings should be in Sections.<br><br>Make one section for each of the sub-installers and call the sub-installers with ExecWait within the Section area.<br><br>See NSIS help or examples for Sections (how to define defaults etc.)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">farialima</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd June 2006 21:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>If a wrapper calls other NSIS installers, isn't the install size wrong ?</strong><br>I think that there's a small issue with such a setup, namely that the disk space required for installation will be wrong, potentially leading the installer to run even if there's not enough disk space.<br><br>Let me try to explain:<br><br>The setup that you are proposing is, if I'm correct, to have a "wrapper" installer contain other installers, that will be unpacked, silently run, and (I suppose) deleted once they have run.<br><br>The user will choose the install location in the "wrapper" installer. So when NSIS computes the disk space size needed to install, he will do it in the "wrapper" installer, and it will be the installed size of the wrapper installer - i.e. the size of all the sub-installers.<br><br>Instead, it should be the size of all the files contained in all the subinstallers, because ultimately, that's the space that will be used on disk !<br><br>Furthermore, I suppose that, during installation, the temporary disk space needed is:<br>- the space for the sub-installers "setup.exe"<br>- plus the space of the files installed by the sub-installers.<br>Which means that, even if there's enough disk space overall, there's a risk that the installation will fail because there's *temporary* not enough disk space.<br><br>Am I correct ?
