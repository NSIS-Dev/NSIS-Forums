Very strange. Anyway you could pack a second installer inside the first, have the first installer install to temp and start the second when it closes. The second could delete the first on it's way out, but I'm not sure if that's what you'd want because the second installer would sit in temp until something bumps it out.<br><br>If the screensaver runs through the standard Windows interface, I'm not sure why a self-destructing installer is necessary, because you could just move the .scr (and/or .exe) around manually.<br><br>I realize it's what the client wants, but I can't help but voice my strong dislike of Turn-Key Installers. Not everyone can get on the internet all the time. I find it extremely frustrating when I can't install something I want to use because it is trying to go on-line (Microsofts' IE installer). If you do find an installer that supports this, please make sure that it can go through a proxy.<br><br>Finally, NSIS does do ActiveX registration, I just don't know how you'd put it to use in NSIS. Maybe write a little VB program to call the OCX and run it from within the installer.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">yazno</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th May 2001 20:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">hi,<br><br>self destructing setup!? .. what is that, lol .. if i set the saver up i can copy it anywhere i want, as it is in the windows directory after setup, like gonzotek said.<br><br>well if you really want to do such things _with NSIS_<br>do it like that:<br><br>1. write a string/bin/whatever into the registry and let the installer check for it, so the next time the installer runs it will find the string and terminate action, very simple.<br><br>2. on my page you can find a function to install a screensaver with nsis.<br><br>btw: there is no unique/save copy-protection and i am sure you won't find one. in 2001 when you release a program you have to cope with that.<br><br>cu yzo</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">deepspring</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th May 2001 03:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><br>Thanks for info!<br><br>The software they are trying to protect is actually a set of custom screensavers, and I can understand why they want to protect their intellectual property from being passed around as a freebie, especially when you consider how much it cost them to build it (ie: Software Licensing, Design Staff, Time, Hosting).
