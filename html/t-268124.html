Thanks. I have taken out the /r switch, but your idea is equally doable. I'd be surprised if someone did -- or eventually will, because the installer is still out there -- wipe their start menu 'by accident'. On the other hand, for it to happen once would not be okay anymore. We all learn from our mistakes. Sometimes the hard way, and sometimes at the expense of others. Can't be helped.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bnicer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st March 2007 15:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I do however appreciate all the effort you put in to help out, if that was ever in question.

The final release of eDonkey2000 (1.45) was booby-trapped to uninstall itself. The company behind the software was called MetaMachine. MM, when threatened with a lawsuit, threw in the towel in 2005 officially. Then, for some reason, the support and distributing of the client didn't stop until August last year. There was an article on a filesharing forum claiming the developers agreed to pay the RIAA $30,000,000. I suspect the report itself might have been planted to scare people off filesharing. $30 million!? That's irresponsible. If you have a working version of eDonkey2000, please don't download anything illegal with it. ;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bnicer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd March 2007 21:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I want to edit that last part, but it's too late. It would be even better to avoid eDonkey2000 altogether. There are other "legal" clients. Emule, for instance.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
