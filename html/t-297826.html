      <p class="post-content"><strong>Does anyone have an example of section dependencies using LogicLib?</strong><br />
      I was looking at the example for section dependency on the wiki and it seems to me that it could possibly be done with less lines using the LogicLib and since I have a dependency tree with 9 sections in it then less complexity would really help. Anyone have a good example of section dependency using the LogicLib?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm.. I took a look at the wiki article ( <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Section_Dependency" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Section_Dependency</a> ) and made a LogicLib version below.<br />
      <br />
      There are some differences, however.. From reading the wiki, there's a comment that reads "# Check if Sec2 was just selected then select Sec3 and Sec4.". However, it doesn't actually do that in the code there. The below LogicLib'd code does.<br />
      <br />
      In short, the behavior is as follows:<br />
      Selecting Section 2 -&gt; Selects Section 3 and Section 4<br />
      Unselecting Section 2 -&gt; Unselects Section 3 and Section 4<br />
      Selecting Section 3 -&gt; Selects Section 2<br />
      Selecting Section 4 -&gt; Selects Section 2<br />
      <br />
      To match the behavior of the wiki article code, just remove the code that selects Section 3 and Section 4 when Section 2 was selected.<br />
      <br />
      In addition, I have hardcoded the value of the independent section's selected state in .onInit. The reason I've hardcoded this is because, presumably, as the author of the installer you would -know- whether your independent section ('Section 2' in the example) is selected on startup or not (made optional using "Section /o"), so detecting this at runtime is a bit wasteful.<br />

      Thank you and good work Animaether! You know what would be really cool, if someone wrote a dependency library or even just a macro for dependencies... so the macro would have syntax something like this:<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro DEPENDENCY ${Sec2} ${Sec3} ${Sec4}<br />
      <br />
      where the first param (Sec2) is the section all other following params (sections Sec3 and Sec4) are dependent on.<br />
      <br />
      Not even sure if that would be possible but it sure would make it simple to set up dependency trees.</p>
