When clicking "Uninstall" in the "Programs and Features" applet in the Control Panel, the following error message pops up:<br><br><i>"An error occured while trying to uninstall "Our Application Package". It may already have been uninstalled. Would you like to remove blah.blah.blubb...?"</i><br><br>Is it possible to solve this issue by RTFM or would someone of you like to shortly gimme a hint? Please see the attached .nsi-File.<br><br>Best Regards<br><br>Chris</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">cherdeg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th April 2008 14:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Ahhh...btw., what I forgot to mention: On XP the uninstall works as planned.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">demiller9</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th April 2008 14:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The registry entry "UninstallString" has the executable name as 'uninstall.exe' and the WriteUninstaller instruction has it as '_uninstall.exe'.
