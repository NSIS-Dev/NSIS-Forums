      <p class="post-content">Isn't that how to get the plugin installed ?<br>
      <br>
      If so, then sorry, It looks like I have expressed me wrong.<br>
      I think the runas plugin is installed and at the right place.<br>
      I did it manually by decompressing the zip file and copying the dll in %programfiles%\nsis\plugin.<br>
      The compiler recognizes the functions inside the dll (DLLMain, DLLMain12, GetAdministrators, GetAdministrators@8, RunAsW, RunAsW@16)<br>
      <br>
      The problem in fact is that every time I use the runas, it returns a fail status.<br>
      The value returned from the function (r0) is always 0.</p>

      <p class="post-content">As I said, it's not really a plug-in, so that's not how you install it. It's a DLL that you can call with the System plug-in. Therefore, NSIS won't automatically package it for you and you must extract it yourself. Your script doesn't do that and if the DLL is in the Plugins directory, it can't find it. Your script tests that $0 is not 1, it doesn't test that it is 0. If you add a MessageBox there, you'll probably see it's actually "error" as you've stated yourself in the first post.</p>
