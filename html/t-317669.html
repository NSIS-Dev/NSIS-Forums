Currently, there is no option to print from within the installer. One can mark the text and use Control C to copy it and then paste it into a document and then print, but this is not obvious.<br><br>I suppose this print option could be added to any screen, but the one we are interested in is the License Agreement screen.

However, when I try to use this approach on a project that uses a eula.rtf file for the license agreement, the license displayed on the screen is displayed in raw text format and is unreadable as a result. Does anyone know how to get around this other than saving the file in both .rtf and .txt formats in the version control system?<br><br>Another approach - I understand that MUI2 allows for displaying rtf text in the license page and have tried this, but I haven't been able to add a print button to this screen. I thought that the page custom functions PRE, SHOW and LEAVE could be used to help me add a button, but they don't seem to act on the actual page, just before or after. Is this correct? Can page custom functions PRE, SHOW and LEAVE actually affect a page directly?<br><br>The other option was to use Resource Hacker to add a button, but I did not understand from the link provided how this would be done. Any additional explanation would be appreciated.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th March 2010 23:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You need to add the button using Resource Hacker (to UIs\modern.exe) and then use the ButtonEvent plug-in to get it to call a function on click.
