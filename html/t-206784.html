      <p class="post-content">Thank you both, I've tried to implement both your suggestions without success. At one point instead of getting the original error I got a message that the installer was corrupt or virus infected - maybe that was progress? All other combinations resulted in the DLL failed to initialize message.<br>

      <p class="post-content">My plugin is called install6.dll. It is located in the NSIS\Plugins folder.<br>
      <br>
      My plugin has a dependancy on three other DLLs which are not called directly from the NSIS script but which are needed by my plugin dll.<br>
      <br>
      I compile the script with those 3 dlls in the root of the script, and when the resultant.exe is run there everything works.<br>
      <br>
      When I move the resultant.exe to another folder I get the messages.<br>
      <br>
      I actually call my plugin in the leave function of a custom page which occurs immediately after the user selects the install folder.<br>
      <br>
      I tried moving the following into that function but still no change.<br>
      <br>
      SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br>
      File "ivnvi.dll"<br>

      <p class="post-content">I guess some background is needed.<br>
      <br>
      The main NSIS script packages up some files including several other NSIS<br>
      output exe files that are located in a directory structure.<br>
      <br>
      In .onInit SetOutPath becomes $SetupWorkDir which is $TEMP\setup<br>
      <br>
      The very first page is MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES.<br>
      <br>
      All the files get extracted to SetupWorkDir, the plugins go deep into<br>
      Documents and settings.<br>
      <br>
      The user works his way thru the dialogs. After selecting MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES<br>
      a custom page is called having a Start button.<br>
      <br>
      The begins the main installation process which installs several packages.<br>
      <br>
      I have now tried two things in my custom leave function since the last post.<br>
      <br>
      1) Since the SetOutPath was already to my $SetupWorkDir I just let the<br>
      files be extracted there. That didn't work, so<br>
      <br>
      2) I SetOutPath to the plugins folder and then set it back to setup, as below.<br>
      <br>
      SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br>
      File "ivnvi.dll"<br>
      File "windblib.dll"<br>
      File "libmysql.dll"<br>
      SetOutPath $SetupWorkDir<br>
      <br>
      In summary,<br>
      <br>
      - a custom plugin is in the NSIS\plugins folder<br>
      - 3 dependant dlls are in the root of my script folder<br>
      - the plugin is extracted to a system $TEMP folder<br>
      <br>
      - I can't get syntax correct to get the 3 dependant dlls where<br>
      NSIS expects them to be.<br>
      <br>
      I think the dependant dlls need to land in the plugins folder so<br>
      my custom plugin will find them.<br>
      <br>
      The script compiles without errors but when executed the DLL failed to<br>
      initialize message is generated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you all for your help.<br>
      <br>
      I was able to get the dlls to appear in BOTH the $PLUGINSDIR and the $EXEDIR and it still failed.<br>
      <br>
      If however, the dll was in the EXEDIR before launch, it was successful.<br>
      <br>
      Since we plan on distributing by sending one file by FTP, needing two files is not an option. I will continue looking for a solution. ............<br>

      Hmmmmmm, sometimes writing helps. It occurred that when the dll gets there by my copy commands its just too late.<br>
      <br>
      At the start of .onInit I added:<br>
      <br>
      SetOutPath $EXEDIR<br>
      File "ivnvi.dll"<br>
      <br>
      Viola! The file is extracted at the very start and all is happy. So now I'm only 3 days past deadline:(<br>
      <br>
      But ;) for getting past this issue!<br>
      <br>

      <p class="post-content">Well....<br>
      There is one 'minor' problem and hopefully a solution.<br>
      <br>
      When the setup program is copied to a CD-ROM, the attempt to extract the file (dll) to the CD-ROM fails.<br>
      <br>
      I tried changing the SetOutPath to $PLUGINSDIR but that won't work in a regular empty disk folder, let alone a CD.<br>
      <br>
      I suppose one solution would be to leave the SetOutPath to $EXEDIR. On distribution CD's include the dll file. For Web downloads, the file will get extracte to a disk ok.<br>
      <br>
      Does anyone has a better suggestion?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have found something that works.<br>
      <br>
      On CD distribution disks put the DLL on the CD with the setup program. For ftp distribution, a file is not needed it will be extracted.<br>
      <br>
      Look to see if the file is in the EXEDIR, if it is not, copy it there<br>
      <br>
      In .onInit<br>
      <br>
      FindFirst $0 $1 $EXEDIR\ivnvi.dll<br>
      StrCmp $1 "ivnvi.dll" nocopy +1<br>
      SetOutPath $EXEDIR<br>
      File "ivnvi.dll"<br>
      nocopy:<br>
      <br>
