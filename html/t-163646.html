      <p class="post-content"><strong>ini registration log file</strong><br />
      Yeah I'm still learning after whole nights in front of my PC the Setup works as I want it to do :D<br />
      <br />
      well, now I have another (stupid) question - it's not so important but I think it will increase the usability (does Somebody except me know this designation?)<br />
      <br />
      I have to register a few DLL and OCX Files (now about 20 maybe more somtimes later) using<br />
      Exec "$\"$SYSDIR\regsvr32.exe$\" $\"$SYSDIR\various.ocx$\""<br />
      <br />
      I get a message box for each file - well thats to which this function is there. I think it would be great to get a log file instead, maybe a .txt file shown at the end of the Installer, which shows all registered DLLs/OCX... and all errors during the registration<br />
      <br />
      I don't know if there is a function for this yet...<br />
      unfortunately I don't know how to realize a function like this, too...<br />
      <br />
      any ideas? :confused:<br />
      <br />
      so long -L-B-</p>

      <p class="post-content">Use UpgradDLL to install/upgrade dll's and ocx's, you can find it in the nsis\include directory. It doesn't have a log function, that I'm aware of, and I'm not sure how easy it would be to implement - maybe someone else could help further there.</p>

      </blockquote>I can't see any matter to use this... im glad with using the regsvr32.exe... :o<br />
      <br />
      I'm just searching for something like a log function as described above<br />
      <br />
      nevertheless thanks :D

      <p class="post-content">UpgradDLL only copies the DLL/OCX if it's newer than what the user has, and if it's in use it copies it after reboot. In the process, it also registers it using the <b>RegDLL</b> command which is what you should use. If for some reason you are set on regsvr32.exe and don't want to use RegDLL, you can use the /S switch for regsvr32.exe to avoid the message.<br />
      <br />
      RegDLL shows a message in the log if it fails, but not if it succeeds. If you want to show a message anyway you can use:</p>
      <pre>
<code>ClearErrors<br />RegDLL "$SYSDIR\blabla.dll"<br />IfErrors 0 +2<br />  DetailPrint 'error registering "$SYSDIR\blabla.dll"'</code>
</pre>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hmm</strong><br />
      thx kichik!<br />
      <br />
      where can I find the usage of UpgradeDLL?<br />
      <br />
      so if I upgrade the DLLs and use<br />
      <br />
      ClearErrors<br />
      RegDLL "$SYSDIR\blabla.dll"<br />
      IfErrors 0 +2<br />
      DetailPrint 'error registering "$SYSDIR\blabla.dll"'<br />
      <br />
      does the reg succeed or fail? I'm sorry for this question but I never mentioned questions about these things before<br />
      <br />
      ok, the second: is there a way to copy the details from the log window into a text file?<br />
      <br />
      thx in advance<br />

      <p class="post-content">Make sure you call the function properly.<br />
      I will have a look at the script for you, incase it's naff!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well for what you want, you should use this similar function by Kichik:<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=153&amp;instances=0,11" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/...instances=0,11</a><br />
      <br />
      My function only copies lines from the log window that contain a specified string (the example on the archive shows that any lines containing "error" will be copied to the file).<br />
