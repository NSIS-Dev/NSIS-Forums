      <p class="post-content"><strong>nsExec on Win2003?</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Has anyone tried using nsExec on Windows 2003? Last few times I tried it it didn't work at all. It seems to work fine on XP though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1345772&amp;group_id=22049&amp;atid=373085" target="_blank">this guy</a> had problems as well. The same questions go to you as well. Have you verified it's a problem with nsExec and not of the program you're trying to run? Have you tried running any other programs? Can add more details about what exactly you're running?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Um, that guy was me :)<br />
      <br />
      I figured it was a problem with nsExec because when I tried the nsExec example installed with NSIS it failed too. I didn't write that :)<br />
      <br />
      I'm running ExecDos now instead and that seems to work okay.</p>

      <p class="post-content">DosExec has no support for 16-bit console applications. That might be the problem with nsExec. It was added because of <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=142028&amp;highlight=nsexec+bug" target="_blank">this thread</a>.<br />
      <br />
      I've attached three versions of nsExec with three different changes to that piece of code. Let me know if any of those work for you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I need to call cscript and I have been struggling to find a consistent way to do it under Windows 2003.<br />
      <br />
      Somehow nsExec does not always find cscript, even if I use the full path. At least it is not consistent across two different Windows Server 2003 installations.<br />
      <br />
      Right now I have this running on one server:<br />
      nsExec::ExecToStack '"$SYSDIR\cscript.exe" //nologo "$INSTDIR\admin\utility.vbs" doSomething'<br />
      While on the other server I had this running:<br />
      nsExec::ExecToStack '"$COMPSEC" /C "cscript" //nologo "$INSTDIR\admin\utility.vbs" doSomething'<br />
      <br />
      On both server cscript is at the same place and in the path.<br />
      <br />
      (I tried the three different recent versions of NsExec without luck).<br />
      <br />
      Suggestions?<br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I have tested the nsExec example multiple times on Windows Server 2003 Enterprise SP1 and it always worked. Can you spare some more details? Do you have an anti-virus? Did you try turning it off?</p>

      <p class="post-content">To kichik: ExecDos works correct with grep.exe if it was called from batch file:</p>
      <pre>
<code><br />ExecDos::exec "$EXEDIR\nsi.bat" "" "$EXEDIR\${APP_NAME}.log"<br />Pop $0 ; bat exit code</code>
</pre><br />
      Batch file content
      <pre>
<code>
off
<br />grep</code>.exe ExecDos Readme.txt
<br />cls 
<br />&gt;

</pre>DOS window not appears, log file receives output. Texted on XP, but I hope batch execution to be the same on other systems.

      <p class="post-content">Of course, I meant automatic support. nsExec creates a 32-bit console wrapper automatically.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I solved the problem by using ExecDos. I then tried replacing ExecDos with nsExec some months later in order to log the output properly (on a different machine). It worked fine the second time but not at all the first time. I'm not sure why, but it was something to do with calling cscript.exe.</p>
