Can anyone tell me why the InstallOptions-plugin doesn't support a "<b>NextEnabled</b>" value in the "Settings" section?<br><br>I just stumbled on a case where such an option would be very handy:<br>I've created a custom page that's only showed when something is wrong (some required files are missing). In that case the next-button should be disabled, because continueing the installion without these required files wouldn't make sense (apart from the fact that it would also be impossible).<br><br>I understand there are other ways to disable the button (e.g. by using SetWindowLong()) and ofcourse I could even go a totally different way to stop the installer, but it would be far easier if InstallOptions would support it. And it would make perfectly sense to add it, because it already has a "BackEnabled" value.<br><br>So why isn't it included?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th April 2004 12:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Use EnableWindow in combination with the initdialog/show functions.

<code>; Disable Next button (dialog item id 1 in "modern.exe")<br>GetDlgItem $NextButtonHandle $HWNDPARENT 1<br>EnableWindow $NextButtonHandle 0<br></code>
</pre>That wasn't the problem. I'm just curious why InstallOptions doesn't support disabling the Next button...
