Absolute system paths.<br>2. End User Profile.<br>4. etc...<br><br>My question is, is NSIS able to perform a search and replace for a marker within a file; marker names of @@marker@@ or %%marker%% or &lt;marker&gt;...<br><br>I would like to add a *few* custom screens which will ask for this information. A user should enter the correct information and upon hitting the submit button the value in the field replaces the markers in the files...<br><br>Some files will have more than 30 markers... Some are the same while some are different.<br><br>I am currently using HM NIS Edit 1.3 and I believe this to be an awesome application with incredible potential. A very good port of the Inno setup wizard and a very interesting .ini form designer.<br><br>I haven't the slightest clue though about how to implement the form created in the .ini to appear in a brand new modern user interface. To cover this problem with a cherry on top I haven't the slightest clue about how to map markers in files (if possible).<br><br>I checked the installoption example and it looks interesting but it leaves me hanging because the truth is I haven't the slightest clue to building an installer with NSIS. Another fact is, it gets even more complicated in trying to port the example from a tiny user interface to a modern user interface...<br><br>Can someone please write a guide on this feature for everyone to benefit from? Can someone be kind enough to help me a little further with this by providing a simpler example which works with the MUI? Also, if replacing markers is a possibility can someone please be kind enough to help in providing some steps to acheiving this?<br><br>I just applied for a sourceforge account and would make thanks to anyone who helps me with this regardless of whether it gets accepted or not.

      <p class="post-content">I am sincerely sorry for my earlier attitude between the lines. I am certain we've all been their at one point. I am not stupid but really felt if it was as simple as Kichiks last post someone should have just said to me "work with this"...<br>
      <br>
      Kichik it works flawlessly, across all screens, on all fields, on all the test files I've so far worked with. It really works as I hoped it would. It is perfect.<br>
      <br>
      I have just one more question I feel could just provide the icing on the cake for me. It seems I get all of these .old files as part of the installtion. I read they were supposed to be deleted but it seems they just go in as part of the installation and stay there...<br>
      <br>
      How do I prevent them from being a part of the installation or from staying in the package after install?<br>
      <br>
      Thank you so much, sorry for my attitude, Kichik, you certainly have a place in my thank you credits.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks again and sorry for my rant.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know in my last post I said I have just one more question *but* I have just one more and I promise once this is solved my search and replace mission is over and I will move on.<br>
      <br>
      I have many markers in my files in which require to be replaced with an absolute path (e.g. @@AbsolutePath@@). I was hoping I could take the absolute path from the "Destination Folder" field at the install location screen.<br>
      <br>
      The trick though is not just getting the path from the "Destination Folder" but also reverting its "\" with "/"... I can get the user to enter this information manually but was hoping I could do it for them automatically.<br>
      <br>
      So the Destination Folder looks like this...<br>
      C:\Program Files\My Application<br>
      <br>
      But, when the user clicks install all markers in my files will then look like this...<br>
      C:/Program Files/My Application<br>
      <br>
      I am really hoping this is not too hard. Please help me with just this last bit of code and I will be out of everyones hair in regards to search and replace.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you so much as this is so important to me to get this last task out of the way.<br>

      <br>
      Can you please explain besides doing the above how I tie this into getting the value of the install directory and then applying that value to markers located through out various files?<br>
      <br>
      I really am no geek but would very much like to use the NSIS installer as it allows me the freedom to customize the installation for end users. I believe it is very powerful...<br>
      <br>
      Just how do I get the Directory Folder installation value, change all the "\" with "/" and then apply that value to markers through out the installation?<br>
      <br>
      Please help me on this last task... I could ask the end user for the value but I trust NSIS to do it better.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you so much Joost,<br>
      <br>
      Before I run into error I just wish to confirm before moving ahead. Do I apply both codes...<br>
      <br>
      The original snippet<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>Push String to do replacement in (haystack)<br>Push String to replace (needle)<br>Push Replacement<br>Call StrRep<br>Pop $R0 result</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Your Snippet<br>
      <pre>
<code>Push $INSTDIR<br>Push "\"<br>Call StrSlash<br>Pop $0<br>;Now $R0 contains the $INSTDIR with forward slashes</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      or just your snippet instead?<br>
      <br>
      Also do I save the function to an NSH and use it the same way I use the other files "StrReplace.nsh" and "ReplaceInFile.nsh"?<br>
      <br>
      Thank you so much for your patience with me.

      <p class="post-content">There other ones are macro's. You don't have to use a macro for this one.<br>

      <p class="post-content">OK, I just need to confirm this before I find myself doing loops.<br>
      <br>
      I use your snippet, not the other one. I save the function to a <b>StrRep.nsh</b> file in my project folder...<br>
      <br>
      OK, once this is all done, how do I say replace this marker @@AbsolutePath@@ with $INSTDIR and your "SNIPPET", provided I've got the above mentioned solution correct so far?<br>
      <br>
      Once I know a little more about the last step, I feel I can move ahead with experiment, otherwise I know I will simply be asking the same question in just a few moments.<br>
