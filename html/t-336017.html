      I know this runs because I get a pop-up asking me if I would like to modify the registry. I click "Yes" when that appears and I get a confirmation saying that the registry has been successfully modified. However, when I actually open the registry to look, I do not see any changes.<br>
      <br>
      When I do this process manually everything works. I double click on "Install.reg" and I get the same pop-up asking me if I would like to modify the registry. I click "Yes" and I get a confirmation saying that the registry has been modified. Then I open the registry and all the changes in the .reg file have been applied. Why is this not working in the NSIS file?

      </blockquote>I am trying to delete a bunch of registry keys with this NSIS script.<br>
      <br>
      I originally started with NSIS delete registry instructions and some of the keys were deleted and some of them were not. I also tried using VBS scripts to write to the registry and some of them were working and some of them were not.<br>
      <br>
      I also tried using RunOnce to call a batch script that executes the .reg file. That will also only make some of my registry changes.

      <p class="post-content">Are the keys you are trying to modify/delete in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ???<br>
      <br>
      If so, you will have to make sure that your installer gets elevated (on Vista+) by using <i>RequestExecutionLevel admin</i> and you have to check for Admin rights with the help of UserInfo in your .onInit function!<br>
      <br>
      Also when using NSIS' regsitry functions, you can test the error flag to detect when an operation failed...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Moreover:</b><br>
      <br>
      On Vista+ all access to 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\...' will be re-directed 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW64Node\...' for 32-Bit applications. You have to take this into account when checking the result of your registry operations!</p>
