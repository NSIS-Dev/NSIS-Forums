When you use the branding text with glow, it has to paint a black brush where the aero is but that results in the button text being transparent too (looks awful) and therefore I've had to do some simple button drawing myself (using WM_PAINTCLIENT). To fix the button text at the moment I'm just using WM_PAINTCLIENT onto the current DC's HBRUSH (this seems to work fine for me - but I don't really know why lol). However, I may have to use double buffering (BeginBufferedPaint) with a portion with full opacity (BufferedPaintSetAlpha) to fix properly. Will post new version today probably. Other option is owner draw the buttons but I want to avoid that. I'd rather let Windows do it for me (WM_PAINTCLIENT).<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">28th April 2011 22:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">New version uploaded which uses the glow size for the current theme and fixes the button text transparency bug on some systems.<br><br>FYI to get the glow size (12 by default) you use GetThemeInt with TMT_TEXTGLOWSIZE.

As a result, the buttons are untouched and therefore you get the proper button glow fade in/out on mouse in/out. Owner-drawn or WM_PAINT handled buttons lose this fade in/out unfortunately and there's nothing one can do about it. Even .NET apps loses this effect if you set UseCompatibleTextRendering=true for buttons.

      First of all I would like to give you a big :up: for the great work you have made with this plugin.<br>
      <br>
      And my question :) is ...<br>
      The branding text is displayed on WelcomeFinish page when Aero is activated; when Aero is deactivated, the branding text is hidden. I'm used to not have this branding text on the first and last page. Did you intend to have this branding text displayed while Aero is activated or it's a bug? Is there a way to not have it displayed on first&amp;last page?<br>

        It seems that Microsoft currently tires to cripple the "classical" Desktop as much as possible in order to make "Metro" appear less annoying/limited. The result will be an OS that has a "Touchscreen" interface, which is completely unusable and infeasible for anything but Tablet computers, combined with a totally crippled Desktop, which isn't more than a emergency fall-back feature. I would be fine to consider Windows 8 a pure Tablet-OS, but my biggest fear is that the epic fail of Windows 8 that we'll see on the Desktop market (we'll see how well it goes on the "Mobile" market) will give a great boost to Mac OS X.

          <br>
          today I rebuilt one of my installers in order to update some of the files included. The installer is using the "inetc" plug-in and I noticed that the text in the "Cancel" button (while downloading) had disappeared! Since the installer script had not been modified, I was quite surprised. My next thought was about the plug-in versions. So I extracted the plug-in DLL's from the "old" working binary of the installer. I discovered that I was still building with the very same "inetc.dll" (latest version available) but had updated the "aero.dll" in the meantime! And indeed, switching back to the older "aero.dll" resolved the issue. So I believe this might be a bug in your "aero" plug-in :confused:<br>
          <br>
          <b>Aero.DLL version 2012-03-10:</b><br>

          <br>
          Really only change is the Aero.DLL. I'm using Unicode NSIS (v2.46.5) , in case that matters.<br>
          <br>
          Any thoughts?<br>

          <p class="post-content">This occurs because the Aero plug-in draws the Cancel button text itself. The inetc plug-in reads the Cancel button text to use it for its own Cancel button but gets an empty string. Just add <b>/canceltext $(^CancelBtn)</b> to the inetc plug-in call.<br>

          So I now have to set all texts for "inetc" manually. Fair enough. Still I wonder why the (slightly) older version didn't need such workaround.<br>
          <br>
          Something must have changed between those two versions that "broke" it...<br>

          <p class="post-content">You don't have to set all the texts, just the Cancel text. And giving it $(^CancelBtn) is what it would be set to anyway, so I don't see that as an issue? Yes, the way the rendering was done has changed (the old method didn't work well on Windows 8).<br>

          </blockquote>Yeah, not a big deal - once you have figured out what to do. Still it would be preferable if no such workaround was needed. Couldn't other random things "break" in other plug-in's?<br>

          </blockquote>If Windows 8 is the (only) reason for the changed behavior, wouldn't it be easier to simply add a version check and completely disable/skip the Aero plug-in on Windows 8? I mean, in Windows 8 they have replaced the "Aero" UI with something that looks like the emulation of a computer from the 1980's. So I don't think the Aero plug-in has much of an effect on that system anyway. Or am I wrong?

          <p class="post-content">This issue is specific to inetc because Takhir decided to use the existing button text rather than hard code a string. There could be other plug-ins but none that I can think of (except perhaps NSISdl).<br>
          <br>
          Windows 8 doesn't have transparency but still has Aero glass (DWM Composition) so yes the plug-in does make the installer look very different. Also it was not just a fix for Windows 8 - it is a general improvement which reduces text flicker on Windows Vista/7 as well.<br>
          <br>
          You can still use the old text rendering if you want to (see the readme).<br>
