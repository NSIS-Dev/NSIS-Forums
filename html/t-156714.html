I think (Its only my idea) all Edit control beter to use Left to right readding style.<br>-------------<br><br>2.There is no way to change Header bitmap between to language. (one for right to left and one for left to right language)so we can not use some graphic like nsis.bmp (see Contrib\Graphics\Header) for multi language installer (with one right to left language) beacuse if this picture go to right seems ugly!<br><br>3.In classic UI we can use one license per language but in Modern UI there is no way to do this (Or I dont know !!

I have a Xp and 2K without any local change only i install all farsi code page with them. May be I can't understand meens of "localized versions"??? ))) version of windows its seems like this<br>Secund RTL word - LTR Word - First RTL Word.<br>you want an another example? see farsi branding text! in english it must be Nullsof Install System %s and %s replaced by version number! i have an CVS version and My version is 2.0b4 (CVS) . this in farsi look like this : (Nullsof Install System (CVS (Install an system translate to farsi word)so i translate it to this : Install System %s Nullsoft (In farsi Install system gose before Nullsoft its true, but version must go after all not before Nullsoft ! )<br><br>or in "Browse..." button. &lt;...&gt; is an english word. (Note : ". , ; :" and all other symbol sebt "?" is english symbol and windows for RTL language use english version of them.) if i translate browse in farsi it seems like this : "... FarsiBrowse" for this one , I use a trick and in farsi i replace ... and browse and translate it to "... FarsiBrowse" so it look like "FarsiBrowse..." but this trick can not used in other controls.<br><br>There is much more than one example. (I test arabic and arabic have this problem too) .<br>If WS_EX_RTLREADING not used in farsi(And arabic, i think) labels and control , all symbol go in wrong place and all english word change chain of RTL word to wrong place! But in NSIS there is no other control (May be in custom dialogs only) dont need to this flag.<br><br><br>You have no answer for My problem with Edit with Address content.:<br>some time in Right to left language (like Farsi - Arabic) the text box (Edit) must be left to right -for example Edit for Address .Address always must be from left to right .(page Directory have a adreess field.If for this Edit allways use left to right style it more beter.
