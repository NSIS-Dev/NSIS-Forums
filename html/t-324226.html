      <p class="post-content">To do this, simply create your own custom page using nsDialogs. There's an excellent tutorial in the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html" target="_blank">nsDialogs readme</a>.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The second page is one large image on the top, including the title, header image, right image, page text (the four items), so you need only create a custom page with a big image and a label, a link and a combobox. See examples (Examples\nsDialogs) and documents (Examples\Docs) of nsDialogs in NSIS directory.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I am not sure that you will be able to change the language on the Welcome page. I am pretty sure that once The GUI is shown, the language is locked. If you wanted that, you would probably need to do a custom page with one installer that then calls a second installer with the selected language.<br />
      <br />
      Come to think of it, it would be cool to have a new NSIS command of ChangeLanguage or something that you could call in this kind of situation.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I download the installer of Xobni, I found that the top image and page title image are two separated images. The language selection combobox is only to determine the language of using this software but not the installer, all the steps of setup wizard are Engish. However, I think that you can use header file to define language string and SendMessage to change the default string of the installer in the "SHOW" function of each page, even this is too troublesome.<br />
      <br />
      Here is an example shows how to create a custom like your image and set the language of the installer to what you select on the fisrt page. Of cource, this is an example, I set three strings of directory page only, you must write and set for each page.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can use ${NSD_CreateCheckBox}, ${NSD_Check}, ${NSD_CreateHLine} (Docs\nsDialogs\Readme.html), CreateFont, SetFont (NSIS.chm), define a <b>LEAVE</b> function (see Docs\Modern UI 2\Readme.html for more) for finish page to get the state using ${NSD_GetState}, and then do your stuff depending on the values. Actually these are all in the help files, it would be very easy if you read them carefully and test the examples of nsDialogs.</p>
