I've been working over a decade in installation development, and as part of my studying of installation design, I am collecting whatever people could share about their experience in this field, working towards practical solutions.<br><br>I'd appreciate if you could share you thougts.<br>thanks,<br>Andy.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">msroboto</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd March 2010 16:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Windows is my biggest installation problem.<br><br>I guess I should be specific.<br><br>My biggest issues arise from Microsoft causing unintended consequences to patches.<br>All of my issues typically involve installing SQL Server Express.<br><br>I currently have about 4 specific items in my installer to mitigate issues caused by the SQL Express installer being stale and updates causing issues.<br><br>1. NEVER install SQL Server Express on XP with service pack 2 this can cause the machine to go into a never ending reboot loop.<br><br>2. During some update Microsoft causes an issue that results in the SQL Express installer not being able to install MSXML6. <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/aaron_bertrand/archive/2009/02/20/the-xp-sp3-msxml6-sp2-sql-server-debacle.aspx" target="_blank">http://sqlblog.com/blogs/aaron_bertr...r-debacle.aspx</a><br>This fails the SQL Express installer.<br><br>3. SQL Express requires a newer version of Windows Installer. See #1 but since we can no longer install on SP2 I guess this is a non-issue.<br><br>4. I have encountered machines that do not have the C++ redistributable. SQL Express requires it. I must provide it myself or the install will complete but SQL Express service will not come up.<br><br>As we look to SQL 2008 we see other issues that I have not worked on solving yet. I'm sorry the specific error escapes me right now. I expect SQL Express to remain the bane of my installation for sometime to come UNTIL we remove it from the product.<br><br>I expect that will be the fix moving forward to go to a lighter database for the clients.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">DrO</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd March 2010 16:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><small>Originally posted by msroboto</small><br>4.

I agree. I am specifically referring to the fact that SQL Server requires this but will happily install without it.<br><br>This requires me to deal with the deficiencies of that installer.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
