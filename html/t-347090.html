I've used nsis to load our company's insurance add-ons in IE silently. While our signed IE dll's install just fine via a "regsvr32 xyz.dll" manually sometimes it does not via a silent installer.

You're silently installing browser addons, AND you're downloading more content from an online resource. That's a very shady combination, and most AV software will find it shady enough for the heuristic scanner to scream fire. I'm not sure how you could change this to appear less suspicious. The best method might perhaps be to contact the AV companies and ask them to fix the false positive in your software. If you're lucky, you won't need to ask again for every new version as long as you don't make too big changes.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
