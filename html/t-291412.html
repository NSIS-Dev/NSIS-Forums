      here we go...<br />
      <br />
      Let's say you want to install for multiple applications.. say, Internet Explorer and FireFox.<br />
      <br />
      Your installer grabs files from somepath\IE\ and somepath\FF\ using the File command.<br />
      <br />
      Now, sometimes you'll build your main program only for the FF edition. So you use File /nonfatal to make sure it doesn't die on the empty somepath\IE\ folder.<br />
      <br />
      However, how can you then - at runtime - detect that indeed that folder was empty / File failed?<br />
      <br />
      Using File /nonfatal doesn't appear to set the error flag if no files were encountered - ditto ReserveFile.<br />
      <br />
      Should I be using File etc. in the beginning for say a single file, extracting it to a temp location, and then check if that file exists?<br />
      <br />
      The above is a simplified example - the actual installer may be installing for up to 15 applications (different versions of a host application), and being able to do this at runtime would be preferred over command-line variable shenanigans.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance for any tips :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Extracting to a temporary directory would work but the best solution is to create installer build configurations. Use !ifdef's and build your installer with the correct !define's for each edition.</p>
