<code>
...
<br>&gt;Page custom ShowDownloadingPage PressButton
<br>&gt;!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES
<br>&gt;...
<br>...
<br>...
<br>Function ShowDownloadingPage
<br>   !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY "DLPage.ini"
<br>&gt;FunctionEnd
<br><br>&gt;Function PressButton
<br>    inetc</code>::get /TIMEOUT 10000 /RESUME "One more time?" "http://mydomain/myfile" "$TEMP\\myfile"
<br>   Pop $0
<br>FunctionEnd 
<br>&gt;

</pre>Unfortunately downloading starts only if I press "Install" button on my own page.<br>
      My question is how to start it when I press "Next" button on the previous (MUI_PAGE_STARTMENU) page?<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for your answers.

      Start the download right after setting up the custom page.<br>

      Unfortunately, it doesn't work so and I still need to press button for downloading. In addition progress bar of the inetc downloading is not shown.</p>

      </blockquote>Well, it works fine and I don't think it depends of inetc as all other functions wouldn't work too if "Install" button is not pressed.<br>

      </blockquote>Actually, I use my own page for checking regisrty and depending of results I start or don't start installing. I can't use downloading on the installation page at all.

      <p class="post-content">Like I said, InstallOptions will pause code execution until you leave the page.<br>
      <br>
      You can't run InstallOptions and inetc asynchronously without modifying one or the other plug-ins. For example, I (and takhir) modifed the ExecDos to run a program asynchronously allowing someone to display information on their custom page. You would need to modify inetc to allow this.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Apologies if I misunderstood the point here :)<br>
      <br>
      I assume that your start menu page is just before the custom page, am I right?<br>
      <br>
      If so, why you need the custom page? You could add the required for download code in start menu leave function.<br>
      <br>
      If the custom page is mandatory then use nsDialogs.</p>

      </blockquote>You are right and my page goes exactly after start menu page. I need my page to show downloading progress and couldn't find any other ay to display it. As I said before I can't do this on the installation page as I need to dowbload files and check registry before and depending of check start or don't installation.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe stupid question but is nsDialogs compatible with Modern UI?

      </blockquote>While you're using inetc, you don't need a page, it is able to load in a function with /POPUP parameter, you will find more info in the inetc docs.<br>
      <br>
      Absolutely compatible, preferable with MUI2.

      <p class="post-content">Had to look into the sources of inetc and modified /BANNER mode, so that instead of it the window with the same size is displayed with the progress bar and text (sure parent window is hidden at that moment).<br>

      Thanks to all. The problem is solved.</p>
