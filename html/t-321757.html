      <p class="post-content"><strong>Install as Admin, Run as User</strong><br />
      I have NSIS/Unicode script that installs my application.<br />
      The installation requires admin privileges, which I get by setting up the privilege level<br />
      At the end of the installation, I want to launch my application.<br />
      <br />
      My problem is that the application launches in Admin mode.<br />
      I'd like to launch it in user mode, just as if a user double clicked its icon.<br />
      <br />
      Nothing I tried worked. Even setting down the level before launching wouldn't help.<br />
      <br />
      What can I do?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd love to hear what you did when you tried "setting down the level" since such a thing is not possible.<br />
      <br />
      The easy solution: Disable the run checkbox on the finish page<br />
      The hard solution: Use the UAC plugin</p>

      </blockquote>There must be some way to reduce a process' privileges. This page <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511445.aspx#elevationgl" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/libr...px#elevationgl</a> says "Once a task that requires administrative privileges is complete, the program should revert to the least privilege state." That phrase is used several times on the page.<br />
      <br />
      I have not yet found where they tell how to revert to lower privileges.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Is the reverse even true? I.e. can a process elevate itself mid-run? I was under the impression that it can't; that, at best, you can start a new process with the appropriate privileges.<br />
      <br />
      There's some discussions out there on how to run an app as user from a higher elevation... one using the Task Scheduler ( <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/vista-security/VistaElevator.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/vista-...aElevator.aspx</a> ), one doing crazy things by getting the desktop (which it presumes to be non-elevated) and spawning a new process using that desktop's security tokens ( <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/aaron_margosis/archive/2009/06/06/faq-how-do-i-start-a-program-as-the-desktop-user-from-an-elevated-app.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/aaron_margos...vated-app.aspx</a> &lt;- <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2009/07/09/launch-a-process-as-standard-user-from-an-elevated-process.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/s...d-process.aspx</a> ) and another that looks entirely like hieroglyphics after gazing at it for 2 minutes ( <a href="http://brandonlive.com/2008/04/27/getting-the-shell-to-run-an-application-for-you-part-2-how/" target="_blank">http://brandonlive.com/2008/04/27/ge...ou-part-2-how/</a> ).<br />
      <br />
      But they're all about starting new processes - in which case, the UAC plugin should work quite well within the NSIS context and would be more flexible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's right, there are several hacky code samples out there that claim to "ride the elevator back down" but they are all hacks and will fail in certain configurations.</p>
