      Yea, U R right - it's not my real exe<br>
      (coz I can't release it yet)<br>
      so it does not have the correct icon resource from the exe file, 1<br>
      <br>
      about RMDir - it may delete some other links or stuff the user put<br>
      in that dir (I think) and I don't like to kill his stuff...<br>
      <br>
      10X 4 your comments and 4 your real great help on this,

          U need 2 compile it using the NSIS compiler to get an exe file,<br>
          (or send me an e-mail and I'll reply with the exe attached)<br>
          <br>
          about the graphic GUI - I was thinking about it 2,<br>
          it can also B a non rectangular shape (like a skin)<br>
          but this may involve a creation of a new modern-UI dialog<br>
          that the script will use, I'm not sure if it's such a good idea<br>
          (in my case I like 2 maintain a small &amp; reliable installer)

            I think U can use "Splash" (in the Contrib dir) to do it,<br>
            and also play some sounds...<br>
