I have never heard of such a bug... Have you ever experienced such problems before? Have you lately installed new drivers or applications but NSIS?

When the installer finishes correctly, that file is deleted. When it doesn't, that file is still there and can be read for reference.<br>The file may just be a bunch of computer code instructions, as long as there is a program that can make them readable for humans.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">SQwerl</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th March 2003 19:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">kichik:<br>I haven't installed new drivers. Although, I did briefly have win2k SP3 installed. I then removed it. But I don't think that would have caused this crash. And no, I haven't experienced this type of crash before with NSIS. I want to think it had to do with a combination of things, and not directly with NSIS though. If I remember correctly I was running CuteFTP Pro 2, which I have had problems before mostly memory issues, Opera 7.03, Winamp 2.80. I think those were the major apps that I had been running. Other than that I don't know what else to tell ya.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th April 2003 13:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well, lets hope so :)<br>Please let me know if it happens again.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
