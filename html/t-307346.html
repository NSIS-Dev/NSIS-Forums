      <p class="post-content"><strong>InstallOptionsEx version 2.4.5 beta 2 released</strong><br />
      After two years since the last beta and 9 alpha versions, this is the new InstallOptionsEx version 2.4.5 beta 2.<br />
      <br />
      A lot of bugs were fixed in this version.<br />
      <br />
      Two versions of the plugin are available: a legacy version and a version using the new NSIS plugin API.<br />
      _ The legacy version work with all NSIS versions.<br />
      This legacy version can NOT be used as a replacement of the original InstallOptions.dll with Modern UI since in NSIS 2.42.<br />
      _ The new API version version can NOT work with nsis versions prior to 2.42.<br />
      This version version can be used as a replacement of the original InstallOptions.dll with Modern UI since in NSIS 2.42.<br />
      <br />
      A big thank to Scott (alias sheik), Daz (alias Dro) and Phalanger for there help to fix bugs of this version.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Changes since version 2.4.5 beta 1:</b><br />
      _ Compiled with VisualStudio 2008. Smaller dll.<br />
      _ Added: setFocus dll function: Set the focus on the specified control in parameter. It was designed to be used in your leave script functions.<br />
      _ Added: skipValidation dll function: If a page contains fields with MinLen or MaxLen and ValidateText attributes, you can go to the next page by skipping the text validation.<br />
      _ Added: New control type VLine and HLine (IO patch _1683189).<br />
      _ Fixed: If more than one notify flags is used for a control, any action was notified.<br />
      _ Fixed: The fopen_s and sscanf_s functions are used by default instead of fopen and sscanf except if you define NOTUSE_SECURE_FUNCTIONS in the plugin compilation options (VisualStudio 6 only).<br />
      _ Fixed: Groupbox and Link controls colors problems.<br />
      _ Fixed: A filter key problem for button using the OPEN_FILEREQUEST and the SAVE_FILEREQUEST flags, it did not cut the string in items.<br />
      _ Fixed: A problem in the DIRREQUEST that doesn't go to the folder indicated in the RefFields State or in its own State key.<br />
      _ Fixed: The Notify=ONCLICK and Notify=ONDBLCLICK didn't work with the Link control.<br />
      _ Fixed: Applied IO Patch that kill some compiler warnings under Linux and mingw32.<br />
      _ Fixed: Use installer's name for message boxes (IO patch #1661677).<br />
      _ Fixed: A memory access violation.<br />
      _ Fixed: Transparent icons had a grey background.<br />
      _ Link and Button can be used in the same way. It was not cleary indicated in this documentation.<br />
      _ The Notify=ONCLICK is not necessary any more for a link or a button using OPEN_FILEREQUEST, SAVE_FILEREQUEST, DIRREQUEST, FONTREQUEST and COLORREQUEST flags to show the dialog. As for if the State key containing something to be executed or opened. Thus the leave function is not called any more unnecessarily.<br />
      _ Size optimization: msdn now says SHGetMalloc returns the same allocator CoTaskMemFree uses and a little debugging backs this even on Windows 95 (IO patch).<br />
      _ Disable the X button for InstallOptions pages as well when CancelEnabled is used (IO patch).<br />
