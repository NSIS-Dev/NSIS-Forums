Very solid - just plain works!<br><br>However, I have a problem. A LARGE percentage of my users are AOL users. I consistently have reports of problems with the download of my files created with NSIS ... this is the text of the error.<br><br><b>NSIS Error Installer verification failed. This could be the result of an incomplete download, a failing disc, or (possibly) corruption from a virus. you can try to force an install using the NCRC command line switch but it is NOT recommended.</b>.<br><br>I know, it sounds like they just need to try the download again, however I have some very persistant users who have sat and watched the download ... and still have not been able to get the file to work, I end up sending the software on CD.<br><br>Has anybody else experienced this? Might it help to try one of the other compression routines? I let it build using the default.<br><br>Any suggestions would be VERY welcome.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">DuaneJeffers</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th March 2002 06:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">This is common, but it could also be that they have a virus if you are using the CRC check. If it is the AOL browser, then tell them to download using <a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-3282264-100-6289136.html?tag=st.dl.3282264.unav.0" target="_blank">Download Accelerator Plus</a> or tell them to use Internet Explorer or Netscape Navagator/Mozilla and not to use the AOL browser. It also depends on the service provider ...
