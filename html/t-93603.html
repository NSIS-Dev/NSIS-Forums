      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      May I know where about in InstallOptions does it allow us to run a menu type uninstall? Appreciate if you could lead me to the example.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Smile2Me was meaning that you could use InstallOptions to create a menu yourself. Check out Contrib\InstallOptions\test.nsi and Examples\Modern UI\InstallOptions.nsi in the NSIS directory.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh yeah, I do have those examples, I am able to create new pages.<br />
      But how do I make these new pages appear as uninstall pages?<br />
      <br />
      How do I have sections that are dedicated to uninstall purpose?<br />
      <br />
      There seem now to me that I am only able to have one section for uninstalling (which is the Section "Uninstall").<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">My apologies, but I dont understand what you mean by "include the period".<br />
      Could you please elaborate?<br />
      Thanks. :D<br />

      <p class="post-content">Taken from the documentation:-<br />
      <br />
      <i>Function names beginning with "un." are functions that will be generated in the Uninstaller. Hence, normal install Sections and functions cannot call uninstall functions, and the Uninstall Section and uninstall functions cannot call normal functions.</i><br />
      <br />
      edit: I may be wrong about prefixing sections with un. but it's certainly correct with regard to functions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe some suggestions (propably already suggested before, then it's a summary):[list=1][*]Repair install[*]Remove/reinstall some components[*]Reinstall program (using the components selected for installing)[*]Uninstall complete program[*]Prefix uninstaller sections with 'un.'[*]Prefix repair sections with 'rp.'[/list=1]</p>

      <p class="post-content">As usual, NSIS will not touch any of these. NSIS will let the user create those if he want and not bloat every simple installer with tons of things the user doesn't need. There will, of course, be an example of repair, reinstall and uninstall page using IO, skipping the components page of the uninstaller and that is required to accomplish the above.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Whoah, talk about resuscitating an old post. :)<br />
      <br />
      But, this is certainly good news that it's in the works for beta 2.<br />
      <br />
      Since the only way I can have a choice component uninstallation now is to use a whole schwackload of Yes/No questions at uninstall.</p>
