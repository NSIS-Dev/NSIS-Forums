      the Notepad for editing (or another app installed).<br>
      When you right click in the "*.nsi" filem you see the options to<br>

      <p class="post-content">To make it all less confusing, I suggest you to read the Modern UI Documentation (Contrib\Modern UI\Readme.html).<br>
      <br>
      The Modern UI is a new interface written using NSIS code. You can configure the interface with defines, as you can see in the readme.<br>
      <br>
      All the lines of code to make the interface work (graphics, text fields, pages, dialog resources etc.) will be inserted for you. The Modern UI also has it's own defaults. That's why making Modern UI installers works a bit different.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I did read the documentation. Sometimes the syntax of the documentation makes things even more confusing.<br>
      <br>
      Do the MUI_* commands need to be preceeded by a !define call, or can they be just on a separate line without the !define?<br>
      <br>
      I did take a few steps forward today, though, things slowly kinda started to click, or my coffee started kicking in, one of the two.<br>
      <br>
      It's all about syntax that confuses the hell out of me.<br>
      Do section names MEAN anything, or can you name them anything?<br>
      <br>
      Component installation confuses me. I've seen it done 3 different ways, and I haven't a clue which way is right.<br>
      <br>
      The mouse-over info in the multi-config confuses me. Where does that information show up in the script? How does it know to display the mouse-over information for whichever section if you have multiple sections?<br>
      <br>
      You look at 2 different scripts that highlight 2 different features, yet you can't utlize both of them to make 1 master script because for one reason or another, once you combine the two, it doesn't work.<br>
      <br>
      Like branding image or the bannerimage and then there's this bannerimage(r). It's description is about as cryptic as the command.<br>
      <br>
      There's too much "theoretical" usage of these things, that trying to actually take advantage of the command to use in a script is impossible as there's no real solid plain english documentation (insert your language) on how to really use it.<br>
      <br>
      Pop is not defined. Or if it is, you have to read 7 other documents to figure out what the heck it's for!! I STILL don't understand what it does. It's like you have to be in the NSIS secret Mason society to understand just about 80% of what NSIS can do. :weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">As you can read in the Modern UI Readme below "3. Defines", you can configure the interface using defines:<br>
      <br>
      !define MUI_ICON "bla.ico".<br>
      <br>
      If you have a component selection page and multiple sections, the user can choose which section(s) to install (the name will be used).<br>
      <br>
      Section 7: "7. Set the descriptions for the sections" describes the mouse-over descriptions.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe checking out the Modern UI Examples (Examples\Modern UI) will make everything a bit more clear.</p>

      I thank NSIS for their very good help, and I think their documents could not be better. (My opinion!)<br>

      It's funny. I understand every technical issue about QRadiant, WorldCraft, BSP, etc. All of 'em. Used to help the developers of DETH as well for Doom.<br>
      <br>
      Funny thing is, I can't DESIGN a level for crap.<br>
      <br>
      I'm the opposite. When looking at a VERY good example script, I get it. Especially if it's color coded. HM NIS EDIT is a WONDERFUL program. Hands down my favorite unless WorkBench gets updated.<br>

      I'm only 15 now, so I have a lot of things to learn and do before I die.<br>
      I'm not sure how far I can get here in the UK (I'm near the Welsh border which is pretty deserlate) but I hope to learn Java, C++.<br>
      <br>
      Perl is probably a waste of time, because I'm not willing to pay for a server which will support php / perl / whatever.<br>
      <br>
      Personally, I will never use one of these wysiwyg editors, or installer generator progs. I want to get down to the hardcore code and learn it myself.<br>
      These generators will be forever limited, whereas notepad, yes notepad! will never be limited to the things you can do (unless you run out of memory!)<br>

      The color coding helps me visualize different sections of code.<br>
      <br>
      HM NIS Edit is basically just glorified notepad with a simple, quick wizard for the basics.<br>
      <br>
      It auto-pastes all the MUI components, etc. And is very handy.<br>
      <br>
      All in all, UltraEdit would work, too, if I wanted to take the time to create an NSIS color code template. :)</p>
