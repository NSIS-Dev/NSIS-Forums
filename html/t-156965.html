      <p class="post-content"><strong>Math Plugin codes</strong><br />
      I made a matrix code sum, but it doesn't work, it exits the MathTest program with a windows error, what is wrong in this code?<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>Matrix(a, b) = (c = 0; #[l(a) &gt;= l(b), d = l(a) - 1, d = l(b) - 1]; #{c++ &lt;= d, x[c] = (a[c] + b[c])})</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      (I'm trying to do more codes for Math Plugin to do basic calculators calculations like Permutation (nPr) or some others I found useful, like a code to round the number automatically, just putting what digit after dot to round and the number to round)

      <p class="post-content">Matrix(a,b) (c=-1; x={}; d=#[l(a)&gt;l(b), l(a), l(b)]; #{c++&lt;d, x[c]=a[c]+b[c]}; x)<br />
      <br />
      tips:<br />
      1. no = needed between Matrix() and ().<br />
      2. x array should be declared before use.<br />
      3. if you'd like x to be the function output, place it as last expression.</p>

      </blockquote>I agree it would be a good idea to create sub-forums for all sorts of subjects, but there doesn't seem to be a need currently. There is not so much in here anyway... Thinking about it again, I don't know why we decided to create a sub forum for languages and not keep it here as it has even less discussion than plug-ins.<br />
      <br />
      Oh, almost forgot... Yay for the calculator plug-in :D

      <p class="post-content">The reason why there is a subforum for languages is that there can be separate topics for languages without having a lot of topics that are useless for most people.<br />
      <br />
      It's also good that these topics are easy to find, because language questions can only be answered by the translators, so it will usually take longer.</p>
