So you just needed to download a very small installer and the installer would download all the big files (medias, etc) from the torrent before continueing the installation.

But I can't do any c++ or c# code (only php). I found out that libtorrent is already very strong and also supports webseed. Thats why I tought it would wonderful match to NSIS. The download is splitet to users and servers. Also you where able to "replace" the torrent and therefore the whole content (e.g. a newer version of your installation or something similar). That would be very great. You only needed to code one installer and the rest would be in the downloaded package. Or you would write an "initial installer" which only downloads and starts the packaege which it gets. That would be wonderful :)</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th December 2006 14:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>Do you have any other suggestions, I am also looking for web install, where I can fragment the installation into small "units" (like WinRar does it for it's SFXs) and then build them locally on users PC and run it once complete.</blockquote>1.Get a command line utility that splits a file into pieces.<br>2.Split your large install.exe in preferred pieces and upload them to server(s).<br>3.Create a batch file (e.g. join.bat) and add the command "copy /b piece.1 + piece.2 + piece.3 install.exe."<br>4.Build a small installer that creates the pluginsdir and extracts there the join.bat, and then starts downloading the pieces from server(s). Once the download is completed, execute the join.bat (e.g. nsexec::exec join.bat).<br>5.ExecWait the pluginsdir\install.exe and... that's all, when the small setup.exe is terminated, pluginsdir is removed and everything is in tact.<br>Note that the disadvantage with all these is that temporary you need double space on target than the actual installation.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">n_baua</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th December 2006 14:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hi,<br><br>I think the idea which should work<br><br>1.
