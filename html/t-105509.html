      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS 2 stability?</strong><br />
      I'm about to release a new version of my program... and it'd be really cool to use NSIS 2. But how stable is the current Alpha 7 (binary on SF)?<br />
      Or is all OK as long as your script compiles? Because I could stick with 1.98 a little longer as well...<br />
      <br />
      NSIS 2 looks really cool btw :D<br />
      <br />
      --edit--<br />
      Hmmm... I really don't know which one to use now :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">The binary at the CVS is no longer a7, it is marked b0 :D<br />
      NSIS 2 actually fixes some bugs that can be found in 1.98. I am not saying it does't have some of its own, but at the moment there are no known bugs. It works, but it is recommended you check it on more than one system before you release your NSIS packed product to the public.<br />
      <br />
      Sometimes the binaries at SF are not the latest, so you should compile from the source code to be sure. If you don't have a compiler, let me know and I will compile one for you.<br />
      <br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">I also plan to use NSIS2 to release the new version of my freeware. Even if the build environment is not very stabe (I have tried several makensisw.exe and finally am still using the one released with alpha7) my installer looks OK. I have tried it on Me, NT4, 2000 and XP and it worked OK everytime!<br />
      <br />
      The latest versions of makensisw.exe had trouble with my license agreement page (maybe related to the text being a RTF file...): the text was not displayed at alll the the OK (I agree renamed) button was not working...<br />
      <br />
      So thanks for the great effort made on NSIS2. The ModernUI looks great and is definitely what I was looking for.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I downloaded latest makensis.exe makensisw.exe, ModernUI.nsh and recompiled my stuff ok...<br />
      <br />
      Still my license agreement page does not work... Nothing is displayed and the I agree button does nothing. My code for the license is:<br />
      <br />
      LicenseText "blah blah"<br />
      LicenseData "readme.rtf"<br />
      LicenseBkColor FFFFFF<br />
      <br />
      I have got a MUI_HEADER_TEXT macro which works fine (the header is OK)...<br />
      <br />
      Any hints?<br />
