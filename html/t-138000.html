I'll just give you the basic idea for your task. In case you need to abort set a variable to a certain value. On the pre function of the second instfiles page read the variable and if it's not set skip the page. If you haven't skipped the page loop through all sections and disable all of them and enable just the rollback function:<br><br></p><pre>
<code>Section /o "" rollbackSection<br>SectionEnd<br><br>#...<br><br>StrCpy $0 0<br>loop:<br>  SectionSetFlags $0 0<br>  IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br>  IfErrors 0 loop<br><br>SectionSetFlags ${rollbackSection} ${SF_SELECTED}</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      This will cause nothing but the rollback section to execute. In case you need the other sections' flags to remain so you can know what to rollback you should convert their SF_SELECTED flag to something that's not used such as 4096 (a safe distance from the last flag).

      <p class="post-content">Yes, that's essentially how I was thinking of implementing it.<br>
      I was just hoping there was an easier way, e.g., maybe have a Section called Rollback the way we have a Section called Uninstaller, which can be automatically invoked by the installer if the installation fails.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks like the second InstFiles page method isn't going to work after all.<br>
      Here are the problems I found:<br>
      On the first InstFiles page, if an error occurs and I call Abort, the "Back" &amp; "Next" buttons get disabled and the "Cancel" button gets enabled. Clicking the Cancel button closes the installer.<br>
      Not good. :(<br>
      <br>
      So, I changed it. Now, if an error occurs, i don't call Abort but set a flag instead. However, now nsis thinks that setup succeeded, so it shows a message saying "Setup Complete" and the Next button label changes to "Install". When I click "Install", its label changes to "Next". When I click "Next", the second InstFiles page starts. Now the Rollback section gets called OK but the problem is that the progress bar is maxed to 100% and doesn't move any more.<br>
      Even worse. :cry:<br>
      <br>
      I'm still open to ideas on how to implement installation rollback. :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Aside from the progress bar maxing out very quickly (which is a bug that have already been fixed in the latest CVS version of now :)) the attached file does exactly what you want.</p>
