      <p class="post-content"><strong>Installing .NET with dotnetfx.exe</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hello all,<br />
      <br />
      I just got NSIS, so I am very much a newbie. I used HM NIS Editor and its Wizard to make a simple install for an application I am working on. The application is written in VB.NET, and my boss would like me to distribute the framework, and install it if needed, with the installer for the application. I have a few questions regarding this issue.<br />
      <br />
      I found the nifty little function to detect .NET framework in the Documentation (and in the archives), and I got it to work with my script. I also read in the forums that you should place this in the on.Init function, or something like that. I didnt fully understand that. Right now this is what I do:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>Section"GLS" SEC01
<br />  Call IsDotNETInstalled
<br />     Pop $R3
<br />  StrCmp $R3 0+3
<br />    Goto+2
<br />    ; else
<br />   MessageBox MB_OK "Can't find .NET!"
<br />    ... 
</code>
</pre>And as you can see this code is at the start of my main "section". My first question is if putting that in onInit is more correct how do I do that? Do I go Function SEC01.onInit or something like that, and place the code there. And then where/how do I call the function?<br />
      <br />
      My second question is how do I get the installer to install the .NET Framework. So, how do I package dotnetfx.exe into my installer, and then how do I get it to run that file (instead of the MessageBox part). I couldn't find an example of this anywhere.<br />
      <br />
      I am kinda under time pressure, so I havent looked at the docs in great detail, so Im not familiar with much yet. That's also why I am asking for help. Sorry if this is supposed to be "common" knowledge or something, and I am asking how to do it.<br />
      <br />
      Aside, from my little experince with NSIS, it seems like its a pretty cool system. And definitly different from MS Visual Studio Installer tool.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Welcome to the forums Latem<br />
      <br />
      onInit isn't a section, it's a function which is called right after starting the exe so you should define your onInit function like below on the very first beginning of your script<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Function .onInit<br />     Call IsDotNETInstalled <br />          Pop $R3 <br />      StrCmp $R3 0 +3 <br />        Goto +2 <br />        ; else <br />        MessageBox MB_OK "Can't find .NET!" <br />        ...<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      to install .NET framework you should use ExecWait, cause it waits until the called application finished, alternative you can call it after your last dialog to install if necessary<br />
      <br />
      ExecWait:<br />
      ExecWait '"C:\path\framework.exe" (/parameters)'<br />
      first you write the path of the file you wanna use,<br />
      and after this you set parameters you maybe need<br />
      <br />
      (You can find more Examples in NSIS\Examples\ as the name says)<br />
      <br />
      hope this helps<br />
      <br />
      greets Davion

      <p class="post-content">Just a side note:<br />
      <br />
      You should also be careful to install the .NET Framework that matches the INSTALLED locale version of the Operating System. You should obtain the framework from the appropriate link. I have listed a few of these below. If you do not adhere to this, you could make your clients system unstable.<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      See the Microsoft Download page for the framework, select the disered language and view the source and scan it for the download link if you need a language that I have not provided above.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the feedback.<br />

      This is my .onInit function:<br /></p>
      <pre>

<br />&gt;FunctionEnd 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>When I run my installer on a computer w/o .NET, it detects that it's not there properly. Then the msg box comes up, but when I press "OK" nothing seems to happen. It did not start the .NET install. What am I doing wrong?<br />

      <br />
      I have attached a modified version of your script that will give you the functionality you asked for, However, I strongly advise that you read my Archive document (Follow the link above), to see how this should be done properly in a multi lingual install.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      BTW: You had it in an endless loop, and were never actually checking the registry to see if .Net was installed.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks alot! I was actually trying to edit or remove my post when you were posting your reply! I'll blame that one on me being just completely out of whack.

      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to obtain right language</strong><br />
      &nbsp; I think I'm not getting this right...<br />
      The dotnetfx.exe you install has to be the same language as the os you are installing it on right?<br />
      But like I interpret your code, you let the user select a language... What if that isn't the right one?<br />
      Isn't there a way to determine the OS language and not let the user select it?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Hello Fretje,<br />
      <br />
      Actually, It does interpret the OS you are running on, and installs the appropriate dotnet executable no matter what language you choose to install the application in.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hello zimsms,<br />
      <br />
      Can you please shed some light on this please, because I realy don't see it.<br />
      What I see in your .OnInit function is the following line:<br />
      <br />
      StrCpy $URL_DOTNET "${URL_DOTNET_1033}"<br />
      <br />
      But that's the only place where $URL_DOTNET is assigned and this looks quite "hard coded" to me...<br />
      Or am I missing something?<br />
      Where is the logic which determines the os language, and assigns the $URL_DOTNET accordingly?<br />

      There used to be a complete example in the archive, but they've changed so much on this site, that I can't find it. I went and looked at my post, the one you are asking about. It looks like a piece of it may be missing. I noticed some of my files had been altered as well.<br />
      <br />
      I currently don't have the code on this machine. But, I can tell you the code you are looking for was in an override of the .GUIInit function, which I had called MyGUIINit. Basically you check in this override for the variable you populated in the .oninit ($OSLANGUAGE) then StrCpy the appropriate URL into the URL_DOTNET variable. The initial assignment you are seeing is just a default initialization.<br />
      <br />
      I will see if I can find a copy of my old example, and post the block in the thread. Finding it, may take a while, and I won't be able to post it until 8pm EST. (Currently (1pm EST).<br />
