      hi,<br />
      i have seen many scripts, that use "System::" in them, and i find them very useful. unfortunally i don't understand much about it. i'd like to know what language is it, and where could i get more information about it / learn it<br />
      tnx</p>

      at first i had no idea about handeling dll's. it is still about the same after reading a part of nsis manual that explains usage of external dll. i researched this script, wich returns current date. now i understand some parts of script, but not the whole thing:<br />
      --<br />
      System::Alloc 128<br />
      Pop $0<br />
      System::Call "Kernel32::GetSystemTime(i) v (r0)"<br />
      ;i understood that it calls Kernel32.dll function GetSystemTime, but i don't understand what is it, that is returned as r0(or $0 in script). i should probably know more about getsystemtime function to understand the answer?<br />
      <br />
      System::Call "*$0(&amp;i2 .r1, &amp;i2 .r2, &amp;i2 .r3, &amp;i2 .r4, \<br />
      &amp;i2 .r5, &amp;i2 .r6, &amp;i2 .r7, &amp;i2 .r8)"<br />
      ;i understand that here are some variables used in brackets, but that's all. i have no idea what '&amp;i2' does<br />
      System::Free $0<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK "current date is: $4.$2.$1"<br />
      --<br />
      how could i find out all that system:: can do<br />
      how could i find out all the functions that dll file includes?<br />
      i need to learn all the basics from the very beginning, where should i start?<br />
      <br />
      i know that it seems hopeless, but tnx anyway :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'll make a tutorial for using Win32 API on System plugin.<br />
      Is not that hard, only know that syntax...<br />
      Like above posting, you'll need to check examples and compare with your needs....<br />
      That's how I learned :)</p>
