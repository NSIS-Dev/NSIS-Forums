      <p class="post-content">Your code looks correct to me.<br>
      <br>
      Would it be possible for you to write a little app in C to test so we could rule out the system plugin? or alternatively debug WBEMTEST.exe and check the parameters it passes to CoInitializeSecurity<br>
      <br>
      (Also, using comments like that in a plugin parameter might not be so smart, not sure if the script parser is able to handle it)<br>

      RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_DEFAULT might equal RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE on a local machine, I don't know (And its documented that you need to pass those extra structs on 2k, so I'm sure its not going to fix it)

      I have pretty much duplicated (in NSIS code) the example MSDN showed, it runs on XP but only gets as far as the IWbemServices::ExecQuery call on Win2000. That call doesn't crash the app, but returns a 0xC0000005 error code.<br>

      <p class="post-content">looking over your code some more, you are using "w" as the arguments in some places, those arguments are really BSTR's and BSTR != plain unicode string, you can use a BSTR where a unicode string is expected, but not the other way around and the system plugin does not have a BSTR parameter type AFAIK, you can make a proper BSTR with the SysAllocString() function</p>

      For whatever crazy reason, using CLSID_WbemAdministrativeLocator in the call to CoCreateInstance seems to fix things on 2000 (plain CLSID_WbemLocator works fine on XP)<br>

      <p class="post-content">Anders, thanks for continuing work on my problem, and the suggestion that CLSID_WbemAdministrativeLocator might work for me on Win2000.<br>
      <br>
      After a little playing around, I've got it working! I switched to CLSID_WbemAdministrativeLocator and commented out the CoSetProxyBlanket. The SerialNumber came back different (even though here at home I run Win2000 under VirtualBox), but that is accurate (according to what WBEMTest shows.<br>
      <br>
      Then I tried a different query (Select * from Win32Bios) and property ('Name'), and after crashing the WMI repository a few times, it comes back with the BIOS name correctly. Hopefully the crash is just an artifact of the VirtualBox. XP continues to work correctly.<br>
      <br>
      [A few minutes go by] Now I've incorporated those changes into my WMI.nsh, and my app runs in XP and Win2000! Thank you, Anders! I'll need to clean up WMI.nsh, but I plan to put it in the wiki when I've done that.<br>
      <br>
      I'm in the middle of moving to a new apartment and may not be able to try on a true Win2000 system until either Monday or Tuesday.<br>

      <p class="post-content">As far as crashes go, one thing you should fix is the w vs BSTR problem.<br>
      <br>
      code like System::Call "$3-&gt;20(w 'WQL', w 'Select * from Win32_BIOS' ... is wrong, like I said, you can't use w, you need proper BSTR's (you can fake BSTR's with the system plugin struct syntax (on BSTR's you are going to free yourself) something like *{i 3,w "abc"}i.r0 but the pointer you must pass is not $0 but $0+4 (length is at -4) )</p>
