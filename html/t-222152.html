      <p class="post-content"><strong>SystemMenu and icons issue</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      I recently started trying NSIS for the "ProntoProEdit NG" product being deployed by my company. I am very much impressed with it.<br />
      <br />
      I have however noticed two small issues, which i would like to fix. I am using Modern UI/InstallOptions for the setup being developed.<br />
      <br />
      The first issue is regarding the<br />
      <br />
      "Are you sure you want to quit ProntoProEdit NG Setup?"<br />
      <br />
      message which shows up on clicking the close button on the titlebar displayed on the finish page. I have noticed that this does not occur in the installers of several other software products using NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      How can I solve this?<br />
      <br />
      The second issue is regarding the display of icons on custom pages. I have two custom pages which have icons refering to icons in a Resource folder. This resource folder is under the same folder where the setup is built. These icons are displayed when I run the setup from this location. But the same do not display when the setup is run from a different location. I believe i am incorrectly packing the icons in the installer. Kindly assist.<br />
      <br />
      Regards<br />
      Anup</p>

      <p class="post-content">1. remove the line !define MUI_ABORTWARNING from your script<br />
      <br />
      2. try writing the location of the icons to the ini of your io-page on runtime<br />
      <br />
      i.e. !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE "io.ini" "Field 1" "State" "$EXEDIR\MyIcon.ico"</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      Thanks for the prompt reply. These are my queries further to the problem mentioned earlier.<br />
      <br />
      1. The line !define MUI_ABORTWARNING seems to remove the warning from all pages. However, I am interested in removing it in the finish page only.<br />
      <br />
      2. I am interested in packing the icon into the Setup and then use it at run time.<br />
      Do i have to extract the icon files to a folder?<br />
      I am also curious to know which folder I must mention for InstallOption to pick these files from.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Regards<br />

      <p class="post-content">if you want to use the icon of your installer, use the following code<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>!include "FileFunc.nsh"<br />!insertmacro GetExeName<br />...<br />${GetExeName} $R0<br />!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE "io.ini" "Field 1" "State" "$R0,0"</code>
</pre><br />
      if you want to use any other icon you have to include it with the File/ReserveFile command and extract it to a folder of your choice.

      <p class="post-content">How can you have an abort warning on the finish page. Surely the Cancel button is disabled (it always is here?)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks a lot for that help Yathosho.<br />
      I was able to solve the Icon related issue.<br />
      <br />
      In reply to Stu, the cancel button used to appear on the finish page too. I had to hide it using the following code in the PreFinish function of the finish page.<br />
      <br />
      GetDlgItem $1 $HWNDPARENT 2<br />
      ShowWindow $1 ${SW_HIDE}<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way to hide disable the 'X' button on the titlebar? or remove all the system buttons from it?<br />
      <br />
