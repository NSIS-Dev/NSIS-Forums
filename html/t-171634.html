      <p class="post-content"><strong>Creating/launching RAS connection?</strong><br />
      Hi<br />
      <br />
      It doesn't seem like it has asked before, so here goes: I'd like to extend the ConnectInternet() and NSISDL macro by first checking whether the host has any RAS connection. If not, create one through code, and then call it. Before I dive into the RASAPI32.DLL, did anyone check how to call those API's from a NSIS script?<br />
      <br />
      Thx<br />
      JD.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the tip, but I was wondering if anyone already had written this for NSIS so I wouldn't have to look into this :-) I'm on my way.</p>

      Sorry, I haven't looked into this yet, but I'd very much like to be able to create/use RAS entries, and have an NSIS script connect to a dial-up server, so that users who don't have access to the Net can still get updates easily through a BBS.<br />
      <br />
      But first, I need to figure out how to call a DLL from NSIS, and then look at some VB code to understand whether RAS32.DLL is the way to go, and if yes, how to call its APIs from NSIS.</p>

      <br />
      With <i>RasEnumConnections</i> API, you can know what connections the host has, using the structure <i>RASCONN</i>.<br />
      <br />
      To connect to a RAS server from a host, use <i>RasDial</i> API using <i>RASDIALEXTENSIONS</i> and <i>RASDIALPARAMS</i> structures, and if you want to a dialog to appear about that, use <i>RasDialDlg</i> API. You can use including with these the callback APIs <i>RasDialFunc</i> or <i>RasDialFunc1</i> to get messages from the connection.<br />
      <br />
      Use <i>RasGetEntryProperties</i> and/or <i>RasSetEntryProperties</i> APIs to get and/or set the properties of a phonebook entry. They need the structure <i>RASENTRY</i>.</p>
