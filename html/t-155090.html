Unfortunately it doesn't seem to actually download anything :( when called. It acts like it's about to do it, but nothing really happens. So I'm not so sure what's going along.<br><br>I'm going to continue to play with it and see if I can get it to work, but since then I think maybe too much has changed for everything to work together properly.<br><br>If all else fails I may just have to figure out how to adopt curl and deal with a larger installer.
