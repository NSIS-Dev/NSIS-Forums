Which new feature from SVN is so important that you need a release right now? Even if we wanted to do a release today we can't since there are at least two show stopping things that need to be fixed before a we can do a release. If you need a sign so bad, check the log, I am committing fixes and features almost every day.<br><br><br><blockquote><small>Originally posted by Yathosho</small><br>i was only referring to the experimental build, which you <i>might</i> give away via irc only. thanks to the wiki's history, one can access some older versions of the uac plugins and despite an annoying visual glitch one older version is doing the job for me (and it comes in ansi and unicode flavors)</blockquote>There is no might, I believe I have given it out to everyone that asked on IRC. I have not tested the plugin, do you think I should post a totally untested plugin on the wiki?
