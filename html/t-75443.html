      <p class="post-content"><strong>Insignificant grammatical mistake</strong><br />
      Consider revising the default<br />
      <b>"Select the directory to install myApp in:"</b><br />
      to<br />
      <b>"Select the directory in which to install myApp:"</b><br />
      <br />
      First, this complies with the "Don't end your sentence with a preposition" rule, and second, it makes the name of the application stand out more, since it's no longer in the middle of the sentence.<br />
      <br />
      Other than that, the installer ROCKS!<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <br />
      I did change it in mine, but everyone else's installer (on major programs, too) will carry this mistake.<br />
      <br />
      We want NSIS to be as perfect as we can get it, do we not?

      <p class="post-content">What's your problem anyway?<br />
      Why do you flame him for showing you a grammer mistake?<br />
      <br />
      I don't think you will like an installer you download to be full with grammer and spelling mistakes that will cause you to spend extra time for understanding what does it want from you.<br />
      <br />
      I think this should be corrected, and if more mistakes are found so should they.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I wasn't comming down on him sure he made the suggestion and then he got repies likew he wanted. But what i'm saying is none of the guys that have been around NSIS for a long time don't really care and maybe they like it that way.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have to agree. Not only does it look more proffesional, it sounds better. The current sentance, though readable, is gramatically incorrect. To make NSIS the best out there, we have to fix those things that are as small and as weird as a single gramatical error.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe drop the "in": But don't change the whole thing. Just sounds too English that way. And your write Cluter it is insignificant!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, it is insignificant. I have no claims otherwise.<br />
      <br />
      Dropping just the "in" makes it sound like you have to select <b>a</b> directory in order to get the program installed... that doesn't make much sense... the idea is for user to select a directory IN WHICH they want the program to be installed.<br />
      <br />
      However, all this arguing is pointless. I don't think that anyone here doubts that my version is correct English, so why not just fix it instead of arguing about it for days now?</p>
