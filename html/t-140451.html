I have about 9 fields and all labels are marked but the fields are not and present a problem in trying to accelerate.<br><br>Can someone help me with an idea?

They should probably be in a group too, but I honestly don't know enough about this and don't have the time to check right now.

Just group them and the tab should work as long as the label doesn't have WS_TABSTOP.
