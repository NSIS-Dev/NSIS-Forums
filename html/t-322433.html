      <p class="post-content"><strong>Completely disable cancel</strong><br />
      &nbsp; For a one type of install, once it gets past a certain point in the pages, I want to prevent the user from canceling. They need to finish the install and then do an uninstall if they want to change something.<br />
      <br />
      I know there are a number of ways of doing this, like using the onUserAbort function, or getting the window handle of the Cancel button and disabling it, etc..<br />
      <br />
      But, I'd like to have the appearance that the MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES and MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES in MUI 2 have where the Cancel button, the title bar Close button and the System Menu Close item are all disabled. However, the Next and Back buttons should be enabled.<br />
      <br />
      I've been searching, but I can't seem to find how that is done. Is there a simple way of doing this?<br />
      <br />
      Or, do I have to write a custom Show function for every standard page and disable everything manually?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, thanks. That works, I found some similar code. And, I just created a function that I call on each page I need to use it.<br />
      <br />
      Even after I read the doc, I don't quit understand this:<br />
      <br />
      ; Disable Close (X) button.<br />
      System::Call user32::GetSystemMenu(i$HWNDPARENT,i0)i.R0<br />
      System::Call user32::EnableMenuItem(iR0,i${SC_CLOSE},i${MF_GRAYED})<br />
      <br />
      I understand Windows programming and mostly the above makes sense. What I don't understand is the: i.R0<br />
      <br />
      I know that is where the result of GetSystemMenu goes, as an int, but what is the dot? The '.' And why don't you use $R0? Same thing in the call to EnableMenuItem() There is iR0. Don't you need a space after the i? And, again, why isn't $R0 used instead of just R0?<br />
      <br />
      The reason I ask, is that when I copy some of these System::Call examples, they work. But when I try to write my own code it fails. ;-(</p>

      </blockquote>The format of the System plugin parameter feeding / output is:<br />
      &lt;type&gt;&lt;inval/var&gt;&lt;outvar&gt;<br />
      In this case, as you want the output from the function, there is no input value/variable, so the . (dot) is used to indicate such. Otherwise, if you wrote "iR0", the System plugin would think you're trying to input the value of $R0.. which makes no sense in this case.<br />
      <br />
      The System docs state it as follows:<br />
      "Either one of source or destination can also be a dot ('.') if it is not needed."<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        <small>Originally posted by miesfeld</small><br />
        And why don't you use $R0?
      </blockquote>Because you're indicating to the System plugin that it should store the result of the function in the -variable- $R0. If you wrote that as i$R0, you'd be telling it to store the result of the function in whatever the -value- of $R0 is. I'm pretty sure that doesn't even work :)<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        <small>Originally posted by miesfeld</small><br />
        Same thing in the call to EnableMenuItem() There is iR0.
      </blockquote>In that case, he could have used i$R0 (or 'i $R0', see below), as it's an input value. Matter of personal preference, perhaps :)<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        <small>Originally posted by miesfeld</small><br />
        Don't you need a space after the i?
      </blockquote>Nope - System pretty much ignores that space after the parameter type. It can be easier to read when you do use the space, though.<br />
      <br />
      There is even a whole 'nother syntax form you can use.. I hardly ever see it used these days, though, so probably best to stay away from it. Here's an example using it, just for reference... look for the System::Call lines.<br />

      </blockquote>Welcome to the world of the System plugin. Few here have mastered it.. I sure as heck haven't yet :) Just keep poking about at it, check out more examples (plenty in the forums), and never be afraid to ask for assistance.

      </blockquote>You mean spaces in parameter values (e.g. for strings.. but those always need quotes..)? The spaces between the parameter type and in/out value/variable(s) shouldn't change anything, though?<br />
      <br />
      i.e.<br />
      <pre>
<code>System</code>::Call "user32::MessageBox(i$HWNDPARENT, t'NSIS System Plug-in', t'Test', i0)"
<br />&gt;System::Call "user32::MessageBox(i $HWNDPARENT, t 'NSIS System Plug-in', t 'Test', i 0)" 
</pre>are functionally entirely the same afaik ( but I did say I haven't mastered the System plugin yet :&gt; )

      <p class="post-content">In NSIS you only need quotes to make a string with spaces a single token. If there are no spaces then you don't need quotes. In my two System calls there are no spaces and therefore I do not need any quotes. I guess thinking about it it's just to stop the syntax highlighter in Notepad2 picking up my System code as just another string in quotes.<br />
