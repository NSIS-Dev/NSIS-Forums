I have recompiled the source with the NSIS_CONFIG_LOG set in config.h. I also noted that there was a change made from Beta4 to RC1 where log_printf6 is defined twice in util.h. I noticed that this was added in so I changed it to log_printf7 (as it seemed to make sense in the code). This was just a warning, the error came because 'len' is not defined in exec.c. Not a problem because I don't generate any binary reg keys in my installer so I defined len as 0 since it is only being outputted to the log file and doesn't appear to be used anywhere else. Once that is taken care of, the sources will compile. I insert 'LogSet on' after I know that $INSTDIR is good, and I cannot find the install.log. It doesn't seem to have been created.<br><br>Can anyone else confirm this or is there something else going on in my code? Thank you for the help.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Spatacoli</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th January 2004 00:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Okay, so in reviewing that change in util.h, I noticed that in version 1.25 of the file each defined log_print is followed on by a log_write(0);. A call to log_write seems required to actually output anything, but the comments for the changes on this file aren't clear to me.<br><br>Could someone review this code and see if it works as written?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th January 2004 18:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks, fixed in latest CVS version.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Spatacoli</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th January 2004 18:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Cool!
