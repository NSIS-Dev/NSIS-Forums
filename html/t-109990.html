There isn't another installer available that has the customizability that NSIS has. If you want ease of use and a huge overhead, you can use Inno Setup. But, of course, then you will be stuck with their interface. I don't know how easier you can make an system as customizable as NSIS. If you don't want to use the Modern UI system, use the standard scripts. Joost is improving the Modern UI system almost everyday. It is 100% easier to use than the first revison of it was. Plus, NSIS 2 hasn't been released yet. I suspect some people's frustration could be trying to keep up with the changes. Well once Modern UI become's more stabilized I'm sure you will not see as many changes.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">BradWaite</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th October 2002 04:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">rainwater,<br><br>I understand that a custom user interface requires more setup.

      Is it even possible to incorporate changes like this? The first option is obviously easier to read and understand. If you don't know what that Macro refers to, you're just copy/pasting and replacing text...hoping that it works when you comile.

      </blockquote>I think we all understand that the UI is created with standard NSIS code. And I'm sure we all agree that macros <b>CAN</b> make our life easier. The macros may be easier for you to use because you created them and know exactly what's happening. To me, and apparently a good number of other people, they make things more confusing.<br>
      <br>
      Granted, I just started playing with NSIS a couple of days ago, but it was certainly a pain to figure out what was going one between Basic.nsi, system.nsh and language.nlf. And I'm no programming newbie either. I was coding assembly on the Apple][ back in '84.<br>
      <br>
      I guess what I and others, are try to get at is, can we take a harder look and see if there's a better or simpler way to do this? For starters, detailed comments in Basic.nsi and system.nsh would go a long way to helping people. Also, I finally clued in, but it would also be easier if the sections were grouped together in Basic.nsi. That way it would look much more similar to the other non-Modern UI examples. It's just a tad overwhelming when you first look at the <b>basic</b> example. :)<br>
      <br>
      Joost, if it hasn't been said recently, thank you for spending the time and effort to make the extremely cool Modern UI. If I didn't think it was awesome, I wouldn't be taking the time to try to make it simpler - I'd just use the standard UI.

      <p class="post-content">Because the Modern UI is made using NSIS code, you always need to insert some extra code to your scripts. "ModernUI on" is just not possible.<br>
      <br>
      Of course I want to make it as easy as possible! Modern UI 1.3 is a lot easier than the first version. I also want to make it easier to use extensions like InstallOptions, that's why I integrated IO support, so you won't have to use all that MultiIni stuff.<br>
      <br>
      I'm also working on a new system which will make it much easier to create basic Modern UI scripts.<br>
      <br>
      If you got a good suggestion to make it easier, which is also technically possible, tell me. But just comments like 'I want it to be easier' are not very useful, I know that everyone wants it to be as easy as possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If someone can come up with a better solution, I would love to hear it. AFAIK, there is no easier solution. If you look at the system.nsh, you will see all of the coding that Joost has already done for you. The commands can't be built into NSIS if thats what you are looking for. If they were, what if I wanted to create my own UI. Then you would have a bunch of wasted code in NSIS, which would result in a larger installer size.</p>

      I've already mentioned at some things like making NSIS look for a UI template in my second post on this thread. In other words, don't have ANY interface built into NSIS, just have it read a UI config file to determine what to put in. Am I making sense?

      But it all requires a lot of work, so it won't be in NSIS 2. Maybe NSIS 3 :D
