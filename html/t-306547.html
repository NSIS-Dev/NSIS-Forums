      Hi there,<br />
      <br />
      Can anyone post a link or some good practices to follow when you need to create an installer for an application that has 32-bit and 64-bit EXEs?<br />
      <br />
      Should we create one installer?<br />
      <br />
      What about naming the EXEs? Should it be myapp.exe and myapp64.exe? or this is completely unecessary as they should be installed under "Program Files (x86)" and/or "Program Files" and have the same name.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have not seen anything specific to this. I don't see any harm in having everything in one installation other than doing so may make the installation size a bit larger.<br />
      <br />
      You can use the functions inside x64.nsh to determine if running on 64-bit to determine which EXEs to install. (Also, since NSIS is 32-bit, it will try to install things in the 32-bit locations unless you use ${DisableX64FSRedirection}--see the examples in x64.nsh)<br />
      <br />
      As for naming the EXEs, nothing really special there. But perhaps from a troubleshooting standpoint, it might make it easy to see the name and know which file is which if the 64-bit version had "64" in the name somewhere.</p>
