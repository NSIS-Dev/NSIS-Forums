      <p class="post-content"><strong>Cannot delete folder/file with non-EN character</strong><br />
      In my uninstaller I want to remove the shortcuts created during install.<br />
      <br />
      The shortcuts reside in the Start Menu, and contain a Japanese colon "***65306;"<br />
      <br />
      The reason for this, is that my installer patches the original program, and then replaces the original programs uninstaller..<br />
      <br />
      Therefore needs to remove the original shortcut created with the original installer.<br />
      <br />
      The program group in the Start Menu also contains the Japanese colon "***65306;".<br />
      <br />
      For example:<br />
      $SMPROGRAMS\Program***65306;Folder\Program***65306;Shortcut.lnk<br />
      <br />
      I hope that makes some sense. For some reason "Delete" and "RMDir" will not remove files/folders with that character in it.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you very much for your time in reading this problem : )</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>More info</strong><br />
      Here's some more info...<br />
      <br />
      It seems I can't create the icon folder if it doesn't already exist:<br />
      Error creating shortcut: C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Start Menu\Programs\Program***65306;Group\Uninstall.lnk<br />
      <br />
      But when the original program creates the folder, I can insert my Uninstaller link in there...<br />
      <br />
      It seems NSIS doesn't like to write files/folders with non-EN characters??</p>

      <p class="post-content">The Japanese : does not have te same ASC value as the Regular :, use the ASC value instead of typing a ":" on the keboard.<br />

      e.g. "xyz"#240"andtherest" where 240 is just an example. I do not know the exact value for the Japanese : sign.<br />

      </blockquote>Are you saying to enter "#65306" into the script? do I need to escape it with anything? Like: $\#65306 or something?<br />
      Or will just:<br />
      Delete "$SMPROGRAMS\Program#65306Group"<br />
      Work?<br />
      <br />
      I will try it, but somehow I don't think it'll work.<br />
      <br />
      When I insert ":" into my script, the Compiler processes it fine, because if you check the log file I attached, it's using the correct colon, but it can't do anything with it for some reason.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your advice, I'll play with it now, and hope for the best ;(

      Normally it would be something like this:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, I'm not to sure how to go about that, (I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to push/pop)<br />
      The only way I can confidantly add a string to a varible is with StrCpy :(<br />
      <br />
      Maybe if you could spare the time, a quick example could put me in the right direction?<br />
      Thank you very much for the help thus far.</p>

      <br />
      well, ok, actually there's another way:<br />
      Push "something"<br />
      Pop $SOMETHING<br />
      <br />
      now $SOMETHING contains "something" (without "")
