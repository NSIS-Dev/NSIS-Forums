      <p class="post-content">Java is far from a system hog. Perhaps you are thinking back to Windows 95 or something when it was in its early days. I would say .NET is much more of a system hog. My .NET apps generally use a lot of memory even for a couple of lines of code. My NSIS assembler uses around 5000K of memory which is tiny considering the size of its code base.<br>
      <br>
      Java can also often be faster than C/C++ because in Java you can't play around with memory pointers. This allows the compiler to do some very sophisticated optimisations which are just not possible in a language like C. Anyway I'm not going to argue with you but I'll just say it's your loss lol :).<br>

      <p class="post-content">Sure coding in .NET is much easier. But i don´t like these dependencies with frameworks, runtimes etc.<br>
      <br>
      You always have to ensure that they are installed (properly) on target system. And the first startup of a little .NET application with just a dialog an a few buttons feels like eternity.<br>
      That´s why i like NSIS installers. They only need themselves. One exe, that´s it.<br>
      So I´ve discovered Delpi for me. Easy to learn, fast, GUI designer like MS Visual but no dependencies to runtimes exept you want it.<br>

      There are a lot of troubles with those ini files and I suppose they should be removed from new NSIS release (I heard about it here on forum)...

      </blockquote>Noone said that InstallOptions support will be removed for NSIS Unicode. Some people merely said that they personally think it should be. That most certainly doesn't mean that it will happen.

      <br>
      Well, suppose you've got an old setup with just 3 or 4 custom INI formatted custom dialogs... if you're forced to redesign them by scratch you'll stay with the old format forever.<br>
      If you could easily import them and save into new format (with some manual fixing), the transition to the new dialog format should be easier.

      <p class="post-content">Really great work! Thank you very much for this!<br>
      <br>
      But I do have a small suggestion:<br>
      <br>
      - Can you make the size of the Dialog editable?<br>
      <br>
      I am not using the dialog id 1018, my dialog is bigger (it is dialog id 1044 with a size of about 497x314 pixel) because I need more space and I cannot resize the dialog to the size I need. Would be great if you could add a property width and height for the dialog component, so everybody can adjust the size.</p>

      </blockquote>Added to my to-do list.<br>
      I was planning to extract all available dialog IDs and put them in a list, but I think your suggestion to make dialog size setting free is better. And I'll add a DialogID field too...<br>
      <br>
      I'll try to put this change together with the pixel/dialog units feature.

      The only bug I've found is when editing the properties of a control, such as its display text. If I press <b>Del</b> to delete some characters from the field, it deletes the control from the form!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Honestly I haven't tried DEL inside the Property Grid.<br>
      I also suppose other special keys could cause issues, like CTRL+C and so on.<br>

      But when you create a new file, the new name doesn't get reflected in this part of the script (It's always Form1):<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>; show the dialog<br>!if "${FUNCTION_PREFIX}" == ""<br>  Page custom ${FUNCTION_PREFIX}fnc_Form1_Show<br>!else<br>  UninstPage custom ${FUNCTION_PREFIX}fnc_Form1_Show<br>!endif</code>
