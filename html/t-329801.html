      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS Dialog Designer</strong><br />
      Hello everyone,<br />
      after a lot of manually-designed custom dialogs I realized that we need a tool to make this task easier. This tool should be a graphical dialog designer, like the one in Visual Studio.<br />
      <br />
      Here we are, NSIS Dialog Designer is almost ready, and I'd like to hear some feedback from you.<br />
      It allows an easier NSIS dialogs design with a modern dockable interface.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://coolsoft.altervista.org/images/nsisdialogdesigner/ss1.png" target="_blank">http://coolsoft.altervista.org/image...signer/ss1.png</a><br />
      <br />
      It works like this: custom dialog definition is stored into an XML definition file (*.nsddef), which is the file NSIS Dialog Designer manage.<br />
      When you save the dialog, NSIS Dialog Designer creates another file (*.nsdinc). This file is a NSIS script containing all the commands needed to create the dialog and all of its controls, including support variables.<br />
      <br />
      For each control you can define name, position and size. You could also link your script functions to control events.<br />
      <br />
      NSIS Dialog Designer is available here: <a href="http://coolsoft.altervista.org/" target="_blank">http://coolsoft.altervista.org/</a><br />
      <br />
      I'd like to hear your feedback...</p>

      </blockquote>What you mean with "standalone"?<br />
      NSIS Dialog Designer is already a standalone app, less than 1Mb installed.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe the screenshot is confusing... making you think the IDE has a lot of components.<br />
      Actually you only have a toolbox with controls, a property grid and one or more "documents" with your custom dialogs.

      I referred to <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html#mref-create" target="_blank">this page</a> to add actual properties, and there I can't find a way to set colors.<br />
      <br />
      Is there some macros to do it?<br />

      I thought to split the designer tab vertically: the top part will contain the graphical designer and the bottom will have the generated script.<br />

      I would like to see GUI designer in main part of window and a source code generated in real time in bottom part of window.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Editor looks fantastic!!!<br />
      The very first look gave me these ideas:<br />
      - add some grid (dotted grid) to main area for better navigation like other IDEs have (+ possibility to turn it on/off) or some kind of ruler<br />
      - give some option to choose pixels/units<br />
      - name your tool <b>NSIS nsDialogs Editor</b> to be clear that these pages will not work with those deprecated ini files<br />
      - add <b>Name</b> into Properties window, all IDEs use the same principe (I suppose you generate name of variable/control as some creepy _fdfjdfjsdh_Label1 which looks terrible)<br />
      <br />
      I am downloading and starting to play with it, great work!<br />
      <br />
      Edit:<br />
      I started creating my own form:<br />
      - add possibility to generate method name automatically by doubleclick based on controls' name (with Name above)<br />
      Example: I have button called Button1<br />
      When I double-click in Properties pane into onClick field I expect that method Button1_Click will be generated automatically like Delphi IDE and also appropriate block in script:<br />
      PHP Code:</p>
      <hr />
      <code style="white-space:nowrap"><!-- php buffer start --></code><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #007700">Function</span><span style="color: #0000BB">Button1_Click<br /></span> <span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">Addyourcodehere<br />
      FunctionEnd<br /></span></span> <!-- php buffer end -->
      <hr />
      For multiple forms there could be some identifier added:<br />
      Form1_Button1_Click or Form1_Edit1_Change etc.<br />
      If I want to name my method manually the I need to write it into box (like now)...

      </blockquote>.NET/Java makes programming tools like this much faster. Why would you not install them? Lack of disk space :)? To port this to native C/C++ would be a lot of work and is probably why a tool such as this has not been written already. I know if I had the choice I would go with .NET every time.<br />

And don't forget old laptops or whatever that run XP out of necessity. So there's probably a lot of users who'd have to install .NET to use this tool. Not saying you made a bad choice, just that I wish you had made a different one. :-)

      <p class="post-content">Java is far from a system hog. Perhaps you are thinking back to Windows 95 or something when it was in its early days. I would say .NET is much more of a system hog. My .NET apps generally use a lot of memory even for a couple of lines of code. My NSIS assembler uses around 5000K of memory which is tiny considering the size of its code base.<br />
      <br />
      Java can also often be faster than C/C++ because in Java you can't play around with memory pointers. This allows the compiler to do some very sophisticated optimisations which are just not possible in a language like C. Anyway I'm not going to argue with you but I'll just say it's your loss lol :).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sure coding in .NET is much easier. But i don´t like these dependencies with frameworks, runtimes etc.<br />
      <br />
      You always have to ensure that they are installed (properly) on target system. And the first startup of a little .NET application with just a dialog an a few buttons feels like eternity.<br />
      That´s why i like NSIS installers. They only need themselves. One exe, that´s it.<br />
      So I´ve discovered Delpi for me. Easy to learn, fast, GUI designer like MS Visual but no dependencies to runtimes exept you want it.<br />

      </blockquote>What you ask is not so difficult to achieve, but:<br />
      - I must generate function Button1_Click inside *.nsdinc file;<br />
      - this file is meant to be managed only by NSIS Dialog Designer, and it only WRITES it;<br />
      <br />
      That said you'll be forced to edit Button1_Click function content through NSIS Dialog Designer only, because each time you save the dialog, *.nsdinc file is overwritten.<br />
      <br />
      I think is better to keep things splitted: *.nsdinc contains only dialog creation related script, optionally calling functions defined into your own (main) script.<br />
      <br />
      What about a function to copy a skeleton function into clipboard?

      Well, suppose you've got an old setup with just 3 or 4 custom INI formatted custom dialogs... if you're forced to redesign them by scratch you'll stay with the old format forever.<br />
      If you could easily import them and save into new format (with some manual fixing), the transition to the new dialog format should be easier.

      But I do have a small suggestion:<br />
      <br />
      - Can you make the size of the Dialog editable?<br />
      <br />
      I am not using the dialog id 1018, my dialog is bigger (it is dialog id 1044 with a size of about 497x314 pixel) because I need more space and I cannot resize the dialog to the size I need. Would be great if you could add a property width and height for the dialog component, so everybody can adjust the size.</p>

      I was planning to extract all available dialog IDs and put them in a list, but I think your suggestion to make dialog size setting free is better. And I'll add a DialogID field too...<br />
      <br />
      I'll try to put this change together with the pixel/dialog units feature.

        <b>v.0.9.7 - 2011-09-11</b><br />

        NEW: New (self explaining) control properties: Visible and Enabled.<br />
        NEW: Dialog name (and so the corresponding NSIS variable) can now be set independently from its .nsddef filename. It could be set through the new "Name" dialog property.<br />
        FIX: Generated test script (the one compiled with F5) now checks user custom scripts to avoid redefining an already defined function. (thanks to Benjamin Richardson for reporting bug)<br />
        FIX: Fixed broken uninstall test script.<br />
        FIX: Some properties appear in bold into Property Grid, even if their value is the default one. This caused the generate script to be longer than required.<br />
        FIX: Custom script editor now accepts TAB key.<br />
        FIX: Script preview is cleared when closing the last dialog editor.<br />
        FIX: Fixed focus management issues that prevents DEL key to work into PropertyGrid.<br />

        <p class="post-content"><strong>Request for comments</strong><br />
        Hey guys, I need your thoughts on how alternate coordinate systems (units, percentage) should be implemented into NSISDialogDesigner.<br />
        <br />
        Suppose we place a button on an empty dialog and consider only its location (the same ideas applies to size).<br />
        Button location can be changed in 3 ways:<br /></p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>dragging the control with mouse (property grid <b>Location</b> property updates accordingly)</li>

          <li>changing X and Y values of <b>Location</b> property (button moves accordingly)</li>

          <li>using cursor keys (the button moves by 10 pixels each key press and again property grid <b>Location</b> property updates accordingly)</li>
        </ol>Now the doubts that stopped me from completing this feature.<br />
        I'm going to have an IDE where each property coordinate system can be unrelated to others.<br />
        I mean a control could have its X in pixels, Y in DU, Width and Height in percentage. NSIS supports definitions like this.<br />
        .NET (that's what I used to write NSDD) doesn't, it understands pixels only (and it has its own way to manage different DPIs, but always in pixels).<br />
        <br />
        So I customized Location and Size properties, allowing user to enter strings and not only numbers (like NSIS):<br />

        <ul>
          <li>120 means "pixels"</li>

          <li>3u means "units"</li>

          <li>12% means... "12%"</li>
        </ul>User entered value (string) is written to NSIS script, while corresponding pixel value is written to .nsddef file.<br />
        <br />
        So far so good, now what if the user drag/resizes the control using the mouse?<br />
        Actually I convert pixels--&gt;"user selected unit" and store this one into property, but this leads to not-integer values, like 1.4523213. To have "human" values the user must enter them manually, and I should cut out decimals to avoid loops.<br />
        <br />
        The first solution that comes to my mind is: coordinates that aren't pixel will be locked.<br />
        I mean, if I set W=4u, then control width will not be changeable by mouse but only inserting a value into property grid.<br />
        <br />
        I'd like to hear your thoughts...

        <p class="post-content">I think it would be 'unfriendly' to lock out the mouse or cursor keys. I think that if a person changes the width (or other properties) you could save those properties in pixels. That's what they are looking at, and they thought it looked OK, so I think they should accept pixels.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Maybe I'm not understanding the problem correctly ,but can't you just calculate the nearest units equivalent of the new pixel position, and save that? This will cause the control to be resized once more after the mouse button is released, but this is normal for snap-to-grid designing.<br />
        <br />
        Other idea is to just revert to pixels each time a mouse-resize is used.<br />
        <br />
        Or maybe do all of the above and make a setting for the end user to choose the desired behavior.</p>

        After a long silence a new update to NSISDialogDesigner is finally available.<br />
        <br />
        The most important added feature is the support to DU (Dialog Units) when generating NSIS scripts. In fact DU is now the default choice; you can revert to pixels through Tools | Options dialog.<br />
        Definition files (*.nsddef) files were not affected by the change, XML will always contain pixel units.<br />

        <p class="post-content">Just something to consider but it can be desirable to mix dialog units and pixels when creating controls. For example, you may want an image placement which has its size in pixels but its position in dialog units. Similarly you may want a label to the right of the image which has the same height in pixels. Also how about percentages?<br />

        <p class="post-content">When I was planning the implementation of multiple coordinate systems I was looking for a case where an user could need mixed coordinates... and your example is what I missed.<br />
        <br />
        I'd leave pixels inside XML, just because .NET works in pixels only and I don't want to mixup things and reinvent the wheel.<br />
        <br />
        Now, how could I let users specify the coordinate system to use?<br />
        I'd like to give them the maximum flexibility, i.e. X in pixels, Y and height in % and width in DU, for each control.<br />
        <br />
        This is my idea: a <b>CoordinateSystem</b> property in each control, with 4 sub-properties X, Y, Width, Height.<br />
        Accepted values for each sub-prop are: DU, Pixels, Percentage, Inherit (default).<br />
        "Inherit" means "Will use the containing Dialog settings".<br />
        This way the dialog is the new repository of the default coordinate system setting; and it is preserved when shared between two developers with different Tools | Options | Coordinate system settings.<br />
        <br />
        What about it?</p>

        <p class="post-content"><strong>Missing tutorial</strong><br />
        Hello @all.<br />
        I'm missing a tutorial from beginners to experts, or an integrated CHM help file.<br />
        I'm using Eclispe with the nsis plugin to develop installer.<br />
        Now I'm having the problem to marry the nsis dialog designer page varibles with my NSIS scripts.<br />
        The target is simple. A simple dialog page with 3 text fields an one password field ('Computername', 'Servername', 'Loginname' and 'Password') shall be written into an ini file.<br />
        For test reasons it is welcome to display the input in a message box. Ho do I using the dialog desinger pages in my main nsis scripts?<br />
        <br />
        Are there known nsis dialog desinger tutorials available, or mabye can anybody help me? :rolleyes:<br />
        <br />
        Best regards<br />
        Martin</p>

          <p class="post-content">There's an excellent tutorial in the nsDialogs readme: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html</a><br />
          <br />
          You can use the NSIS Dialog Designer for generating the layout-specific code, then use that in your nsDialogs page functions. (Note: When using nsDialogs, make sure you use MUI2, not MUI.)</p>
