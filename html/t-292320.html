I have attached my installer script , If anyone has some time to look and point me in the right direction I would be very happy<br><br>take note im not sure if im writing all reg strings correctly??<br><br>what is the "law/rules" for writing the value of say:<br>PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY ??<br><br>there doesnt seems to be good documentation on grasping what these types of values should be?:mad:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th May 2008 18:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You should take a look at the included examples as well ;)<br>Especially the script makensis.nsi which is the actual nsis installer, might give you some clue.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">tictox</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th May 2008 10:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>still no luck</strong><br>K ..I looked at the makensis.nsi script .. It wasnt really any help, as it has very customized uninstaller code and is not inline with the script i attached and the scripts I used as a reference for my code, I have been trying all sorts this morning and I cannot get the uninstaller to run.. ? Im attaching my script again , IF anyone knows why this is not working pls let me know</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th May 2008 12:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">If $0 contains spaces then you won't get anything executing.
