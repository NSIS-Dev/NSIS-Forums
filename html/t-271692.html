      <p class="post-content"><strong>Multiple Setup question</strong><br />
      Is there a way to run a second setup wizard after the first one has finished and the user has press Finished from a DVD?<br />
      <br />
      for Example:<br />
      Setup1 installs<br />
      Setup2 is called after the user clicks finish in Setup1.<br />
      Both Setup1 and Setup2 are on a DVD.<br />
      <br />
      How can I do this?</p>

      1. How can I make it so that if the user doesnt install Setup1 first and runs Setup2 Manually that the Installer will tell the user to run Setup1 first?<br />

      2. How can I make it so that if Setup1 was ran and they try to run it again it gives them the uninstall?<br />
      <br />
      Likewise if when the user trys to run setup2 again after it has already been installed make it so that it give them the uninstall?</p>

      <p class="post-content">1. write a key in the registry when setup1 complete successfully. check this registry key in setup2<br />
      2. check the standard registry key where unistaller names are kept and run the uninstaller<br />
      I use this defines at top of my install scripts:<br />
      !define PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${PRODUCT_NAME}"<br />
      !define PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY "HKLM"<br />
      <br />
      then define PRODUCT_NAME to what you want<br />
      and in the uninstaller code add something like:<br />
      <br />
      WriteRegStr ${PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY} "${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY}" "DisplayName" "$(^Name)"<br />
      WriteRegStr ${PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY} "${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY}" "UninstallString" "$INSTDIR\uninst.exe"<br />
      WriteRegStr ${PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY} "${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY}" "DisplayVersion" "${PRODUCT_VERSION}"<br />
      WriteRegStr ${PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY} "${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY}" "URLInfoAbout" "${PRODUCT_WEB_SITE}"<br />
      WriteRegStr ${PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY} "${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY}" "Publisher" "${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}"</p>

      What I wanted is to have:<br />

      Setup1 check to see if the game is installed on run and if it is then show uninstall Dialog<br />
      <br />
      Setup2 same as setup1 but only after it is finished with its installation.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Think about how you will check if the game is installed. Registry? Existence of files?<br />

      <p class="post-content">existence of files would be good. That way if the user tries to run setup2 before setup1 I would be able to tell them to run setup1 first.<br />
      <br />
      for example:<br />
      setup1 installs:<br />
      1.file<br />
      2.file<br />
      <br />
      and setup2 installs:<br />
      3.file<br />
      4.file<br />
      <br />
      Setup1 installs its files and then if the user tries to run setup1 again it will find the files setup1 already installed and gives the user to uninstall.<br />
      <br />
      Setup2 on run will check for setup1's files and if it finds them then installs its files.<br />
      <br />
      if Setup2 doesn't find setup1's files it tells the user to run setup1.<br />
      <br />
      After setup2 is done and they try to run setup2 again it checks for the existence of the files and if they exist then it shows them the uninstall.</p>

      <p class="post-content">But at the end of the day, you would probably have to use a registry entry for this. If the first installer writes the install path to the registry, then you can read that path in the second installer.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: Perhaps a good solution for this first and second installer installation order dependency would be to use InstallDirRegKey. If the first installer writes the path after a successful install, the second installer can check if that registry entry exists to determine if the first install has been completed.<br />
