It's something much simpler actually. Something called file size. The more colors your icon has the more space it's going to take up (compressed or not) So by limiting it to 16 colors by default this will make for the smallest possible executable. And though the super VGA has been out for a while that doesn't mean everyone is using it. There are still those who choose to stick with older technologies and what not. So if you want 256 colors get the source and do a search in the forum.

For ease of argument I'll use the default NSIS icon. File size of the NSIS icon in 16 colors: 766 bytes, file size of the <b>same</b> icon in 256 colors: 2.92 kilobytes! That means just by bumping the colors up to 256 you almost quadrople the file size! Okay, you say 3kb ain't huge, but when you are making installers that are less the 35 kilobytes like I do, 3 kilobytes is a lot!
