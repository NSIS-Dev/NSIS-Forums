      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hide a dialog window (N00b Question)</strong><br />
      (I am new to NSIS so do pardon me.)<br />
      <br />
      I simply want to hide a dialog window. I found several topics discussing in a round-about way, but nothing that directly/simply showed how to do this. In particular, I'm trying to hide the Finish dialog window inside .onInstSuccess.<br />
      <br />
      This is what I tried:<br />
      <br />
      Function .onInstSuccess<br />
      ;FindWindow $0 $HWNDPARENT<br />
      ;FindWindow $0 "" "${PRODUCT_NAME} ${PRODUCT_VERSION} Setup" 0 0<br />
      ;HideWindow<br />
      <br />
      FindWindow $0 '#32770'<br />
      ;FindWindow $0 '#32770' '' 0 $0<br />
      <br />
      ShowWindow $0 ${SW_HIDE}<br />
      ;ShowWindow $MUI_HWND ${SW_HIDE}<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      I cannot get any of these methods to work. Am I doing my ShowWindow line wrong?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">HideWindow hides the installer. But if you don't want the finish page, simply don't use the finish page. Remove its macro insertion.</p>

      Thanks for your help (again) :P.<br />
      <br />
      Well, I want to show the finish dialog.<br />
      <br />
      I'm running my SQL script once they click finish, and while it runs, I'm using the NotifyIcon plugin to show a balloon in the task bar while the script runs. Then when complete, I show success or failure in my NotifyIcon.<br />
      <br />
      However, I discovered that if I call NotifyIcon (or anything else GUI-related), that my NotifyIcon doesn't stay in the task bar when the mouse hovers over - the only thing keeping it open is the baloon message. SO, I moved my code up to .onInstSuccess to fix that. I thus want to hide the dialog while it continues to run, keeping my NotfyIcon in the task bar. Then I tear it down after it completes. I thought it was going to be a slick'n'quick solution, arg!<br />
      <br />
      WHY doesn't this work?<br />
      <br />
      FindWindow $0 '#32770' '' 0 $0<br />
      ShowWindow $0 ${SW_HIDE}<br />

      <p class="post-content">That last piece of code doesn't work because you're trying to hide the internal dialog and not the whole dialog. Just use HideWindow which does all that for you.</p>

      Yeah, that's what I thought. I tried it earlier and didn't seem to work (so I thought) so I moved on to others things. However, when I simplified my code down and tried it again as you suggested, it DOES work. But for some reason, the window paints again once I call NotifyIcon and launch my script. I'm guessing NotfiyIcon is causing it. For example:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>

      Sorry about the formatting and length. But I am finding that I should post or show the full logic in order for my scenario to make sense. So here it is.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can attach script files to avoid formatting issues.<br />
      <br />
      This problem can be solved just like the other one. Create another installer, make it silent, make it use whatever pop-ups it needs and execute it from the main installer. This way, you'll have no dialogs to handle.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the suggestion. I just might give in! I just can't seem to get it to work the way I want here otherwise. The thing is, I KNOW there is a way to do it given all the nifty abilities of NSIS (and contributions). I think it has something to do with the /NOUNLOAD with the NotfiyIcon plugin, or how it interacts with the dialog.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I think I'm just gonna write a quick bootstrap exe to do what I want: Then I have ultimate control. I'll leave NSIS to do what it does best: install stuff.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the reminder, kichik. Your idea of splitting it off is gonna be the best approach.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers!<br />
