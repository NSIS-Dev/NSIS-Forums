      <p class="post-content"><strong>Uninstall.exe, "New Program installed" bubble and yellow background.</strong><br />
      Hi Folks!<br />
      <br />
      I have a very strange problem and need your Help:<br />
      <br />
      Windows XP has the feature to show newly installed programms highlighted in the start manu. First, it shows a bubble with the text "New program installed". If the program folder is opened, new entries are highlighted yellow.<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, the created unistall.exe is always shown as new (has yellow background) which is quite irritating for users. Sometimes this "bubble" is also shown again and again..<br />
      <br />
      After some digging in the network, I've learned that the file version info is used by Windows to detect whether the file is new. Thus, I used the functions<br />
      VIProductVersion and VIAddVersionKey to set this information. But it does not change anything...<br />
      <br />
      Now, I'm quite helpless and need some assistance.. Please, don't let me stay out here in the rain! ;)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance!<br />
      <br />
      Stefan</p>

      It points out some rules about what is considered 'new' and states that uninstallers should not be shown.<br />
      <br />
      Considering this is a blog site, I'm not sure how accurate the info really is. But, I did notice in your original post, you misspelled "uninstall.exe". (yours is spelled "unistall.exe") I'm not sure if this was just misspelled in the post, or if your actual file name is also misspelled--if it is, you might give this a shot.<br />
      <br />
      If not, then I'm at a loss... (Maybe someone else has some more dirt on this...)</p>

      <br />
      The blog just states that new files are highlighted and that they are various reasons why special shortcuts are ignored.<br />
      <br />
      My situation is the opposite way: The file "uninstall.exe" (unistall.exe was just a typo), is shown as new, which is very annoying.<br />
      The blog says that files are shown as new, until they are executed.. This isn't the behavior I see on windows and it wouldn't be a big help on that file, anyway! ;)
