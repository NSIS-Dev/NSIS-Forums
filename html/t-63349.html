      <p class="post-content"><strong>What do you think of my NSIS GUI?</strong><br />
      I've used the StateBlue NSIS GUI version 0.025 and I didn't like it too much because some features didn't work right for me. Anyway, I decided to make my own NSIS GUI. So, What do you think of it. It has some features that the StateBlue version 0.025 doesn't have.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, I think you might need the VB6 runtimes for it. They can be downloaded <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp4/win98/EN-US/VBRun60sp4.exe" target="_blank">here</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">Nick, I tried to run your program, but after the splash screen, it crashes out with this message:</p>
      <pre>
<code>Run-Time error '339'<br />Component 'COMDLG32.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      I don't think it is my system, because it's WinME, I made sure I had the VB6 runtimes, and I have all the updates from Windows Update, and I haven't had any problems running other VB software.<br />
      <br />
      If you want, we can trade beta's and test each other's software. I'm working on a winampdb-like win32 program. PM me if you're interested. An early verion of the program is in my sig. The executable might not work, but the source is included.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think it's because the runtimes don't include that file. Extract the comdlg32.ocx in <a href="http://www.megasecurity.org/Needed_files/Comdlg32.zip" target="_blank">this</a> zip file to the system directory.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, I fixed a coupple bug in my nsis gui. Here is the newest version. I hope it works now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I found a link to all of the vb6 runtimes so if you don't want to download the all the runtime files just run <a href="http://www.wolfiesden.com/downloads/files/vb6run12031999.exe" target="_blank">this</a> exe file. Drawback is that it is about 3.5 mb. Haven't tested it tho. Good luck with my NSIS GUI.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I used the 3.5meg installer and then ran your latest (0.1.2). It works now, and, while I might not be the biggest fan of wizards, it looks nice and I'll probably use it as a "starter" kit for my nsis scripts from now on. If I run into any problems as I'm testing it out, I'll let you know.<br />
      <br />
      Don't take my lack of enthusiasm about wizards as a critisism towards your program, Microsoft soured Wizards for me. Your program is pretty well laid out. I might have a few questions for you, though.<br />

      well, i really cannot express the anger i feel right now, seeing the opening screen of your program badmouth mine. (slate blue).<br />
      <br />
      but anyway, maybe we should collaborate on slate blue to make it better, in your way of thinking.<br />

      <br />
      BTW, new version of my NSIS GUI. Fixed a few minor typographical errors and added start menu creation. For the record, I don't really feel like a competor to you. I have both nsis gui's and encourage everybody else to do the same.</p>

      i think you are onto a usefull app, what i would like to see is it integrated with slateblue... so you run slateblue and it would have a wizard button you run through that app (cleaned up visually) and when finished you have the option to send info back to slateblue, or save to script, or to compile.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>yay</strong><br />
      i totally agree; one of my most faithful users has suggested something like winzip, where you can choose the wizard interface (n_ick2000's gui), or the classic (slate blue). if we combined these, it would be the ultimate gui :)<br />
      <br />
      plus, mine doesn't even require the makensis.exe to compile :)<br />
      <br />
      i hope we can get started soon,</p>

      <p class="post-content">trace: n_ick2000's gui and slate blue have officially been combined. i have rewritten and visually cleaned up his wizard, and added it to slate blue as the wizard creator. you can still use regular slate blue for creating more advanced scripts.</p>

      This is (I think) the most current version. He probably hasn't updated the site to reflect the latest version, yet. I'm guessing it because he's been so busy with the program ;)<br />

      <br />
      the new version, to be released before dec. 15, does contain the wizard, and an updated interface. this release is a total rewrite, which allowed me to release the old source code.<br />
      <br />
      the page hasn't been updated since, as Gonzotek stated, I've been working hard on the program. i will try to work on the site tonight, but my magic eight ball says "outlook is doubtful".<br />
