      <p class="post-content"><strong>Eliminating "zeroing code out" warning</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      i am using the EnvVarUpdate.nsh to set a system variable.<br />
      Now I am getting the following warning:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>"uninstall function un.EnvVarUpdate" not referenced - zeroing code (179-377) out"</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Indicating i am not calling "un.EnvVarUpdate" - removing that system variable during uninstallment. However for certain reasons I do not want to remove that variable. But how can i get rid of that warning without calling "un.EnvVarUpdate"?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">You're mistaken about the meaning of the warning.<br />
      <br />
      The warning does not mean that the uninstaller will remove the environment variable during uninstall. (The NSIS compiler doesn't actually understand NSIS scripts on such a level.)<br />
      In fact, the warning only means that the function "un.EnvVarUpdate" is never *called* by your script, and therefore the function is never used. Unused functions only consume memory without ever doing anything, so the compiler just skips the function and doesn't compile it.<br />
      <br />
      Unused functions are perfectly fine. (After all, the only bad thing they could do is waste memory, and the compiler prevents that by skipping their code.) As long as *you* don't remove the enironment variable during uninstall, then *NSIS* will also not remove it. NSIS only does exactly what you tell it to do in the nsi script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      thanks for your answer.<br />
      However I was not mistaken about the warning mabye i didn't write it clearly. As I said in my previous post ("Indicating i am not calling "un.EnvVarUpdate" ") i am not calling that function so i get that warning. There is of course no magic removal of that variable or things like that ;)<br />
      <br />
      My question was: How can I get rid of that warning without calling "un.EnvVarUpdate" in my script. I know that the warning can be ignored - however I don't want to. Thus my question is: Is there is a way to remove or surpress that warning.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks<br />

      <p class="post-content">One possibility I see is to adapt the 'EnvVarUpdate.nsh' file and remove the code - however I had hoped there's a better solution...</p>
