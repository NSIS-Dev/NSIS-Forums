As many of you may be aware, WinHelp is not supported by Vista. I know that the proper solution to this is to update my help documents to a supported help system but unfortunately I don't have the time at this point.<br><br>I checked around the Microsoft website and found a WinHelp installer for Vista - an msu file. What I planned on doing was updating my NSIS install script to call this msu file and silently install WinHelp during my application's installation. Here's my code:<br><br></p><pre>
<code>ExecWait "wusa.exe $EXEDIR\winhelp.msu /quiet /norestart"</code>
</pre><br><br>When I try to execute this on a Vista box, I don't get any errors. But when I check to see if the patch installed correctly in Control Panel --&gt; Programs, I see that it didn't install. When I try to launch the help documentation from my application, it doesn't launch.<br><br>I can manually install WinHelp on the machine and it works fine, it's just that I was hoping to silently install WinHelp so the user isn't bothered with installing it. Any ideas?<br><br>Also, if any of you can suggest a good help format and an application for creating help files in that format I would be thankful.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th May 2007 17:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Make sure you put quotes around the path:<br>ExecWait 'wusa.exe "$EXEDIR\winhelp.msu" /quiet /norestart'<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Clockwatcher</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th May 2007 18:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for the reply.

Also, Wusa.exe does not notify the WUA that Windows Update can install the package without displaying the custom software license agreement.</blockquote>Thanks for the help.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
