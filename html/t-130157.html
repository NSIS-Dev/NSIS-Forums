      <p class="post-content"><strong>Bug?</strong><br />
      <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/imker/afrowuk/temppics/nsis_1.jpg" target="_blank">http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/imker/afr...ics/nsis_1.jpg</a><br />
      <br />
      I get this when I run my logging program.<br />
      <br />
      It happens after the 'Medic Heals' count, which makes you assume that it is the 'Medic Heals' count function, or maybe the next count function that is causing this error.<br />
      <br />
      BUT<br />
      <br />
      If I blank out the Calls for all functions accept the first function (for getting the 'kills' count,) then instead I get this error appearing from that function instead!<br />
      <br />
      Is this some bug being caused by the compiler?<br />
      <br />
      opcode, I assumed the IntOp, but that looks fine:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />IntOp $3 $3 + 1<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Another problem I have:<br />
      I have a Custom Page MainPage in my script, and then I have a InstFiles page. However, the Next &gt; button on the Custom Page doesn't go to the InstFiles page, but instead does nothing.<br />
      <br />
      I have included the whole script below.

      <p class="post-content">Can you please pin point the exact command that causes this message?<br />
      <br />
      The next button that does nothing was caused because you had only that custom page defined and no other page. When using Page you have to define <b>all</b> of the pages that your installer is using.</p>

      </blockquote>I have narrowed it down to the SpecialKillsCount, because clearing the whole of that function fixes it.<br />
      I'm now going to remove parts of the function until it stops happening.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can also add DetailPrint before each command until you see one DetailPrint that isn't printed and then you'll know the command before it is the one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is what I removed, and that fixed it. I can't see anything visually wrong though! Can you?<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />   Push $1<br />   Push "${NAME}'s handgrenade"<br />    Call StrStr<br />     Pop $2<br /><br />      # Add to count<br />      StrCmp $2 "" +3<br />      IntOp $7 $7 + 1<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      OMG wait...<br />
      I haven't changed the +3 to a +2!!!<br />
      ACK<br />
      It works now.<br />
