      <p class="post-content"><strong>JRE check and update prior to application install</strong><br />
      I've found several references to checking the JRE in the examples and forums (see links below), but have not had success using NSIS 2.39.<br />
      <br />
      I've tried to mesh the solutions found online with the script generated by EclipseNSIS, but am not sure how to make the association with 'jre.ini'. The examples use a 'jre.ini' file. However, it appears that the latest version of NSIS does not support that method and recommends using nsDialogs instead.<br />
      <br />
      I've attached what I've come up with for a .nsi file.<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone have an example of doing a JRE check/install using the nsDialogs?<br />
      <br />
      Even better, if anyone knows how this is done through the EclipseNSIS plugin, that would be great too!<br />
      <br />
      Regards,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thank you ZmAn3.<br />
      <br />
      I've gotten the check to work, and I believe I've even gotten the download of the JRE to work, however, I am having a permissions issue with the temp directory that the jre is written to. I need a way to give the IUSR permissions to write to the temp directory. The local user would have admin rights to read it and install it.<br />
      <br />
      Any help in getting the permissions set for the download of the JRE would be helpful.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you,</p>

      <p class="post-content">I realize this is an old thread, but did you ever get this to work? I'm having the same issue as your initial question and am having trouble finding any help. Surely somebody is doing this -would think that this would be a common need! Thanks...</p>
