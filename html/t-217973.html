</pre><br>
      <br>
      When I try something very similar, nothing seems to happen. Is there something else I need to do in my script to let the system.dll plug-in be used?<br>
      <br>
      How do I have the environment variable DID_IT_WORK be created with the value "YES"?<br>
      <br>
      I looked at the top of the compiler output, and system::call was shown.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;/alert&gt;

      <p class="post-content">Ahh ... now it is becoming much clearer &lt;g&gt;<br>
      <br>
      Thanks. Seems to work fine. I can now look in "System" + "Environment Variable" and see that DID_IT_WORK is set to "YES". Also, I can start a "DosPrompt" window and have<br>
      C:&gt; set di<br>
      confirm that DID_IT_WORK is "YES". Cool.<br>
      <br>
      A related (followup) question ... I tried to have the TestSetEnv.nsi have a confirming MessageBox that it worked. In the snippet from that script below, I was expecting:<br>
      <br>
      * R0 would have the TEMP value (worked)<br>
      <br>
      * R1 would be blank (yes)<br>
      <br>
      * R2 would have "YES" (was still blank)<br>
      <br>
      Is there some kind of delay or sync?<br>
      <br>
      ReadEnvStr $R0 TEMP<br>
      ReadEnvStr $R1 DID_IT_WORK<br>
      <br>
      Push "DID_IT_WORK"<br>
      Push "YES"<br>
      <br>
      Call WriteEnvStr<br>
      <br>
      ReadEnvStr $R2 DID_IT_WORK<br>
      MessageBox MB_OK "RO (TEMP) is set to $R0 \<br>
      $\r$\nR1 (before) is set to $R1 \<br>
      $\r$\nR2 (after) is set to $R2"</p>

      <p class="post-content">WriteEnvStr only updates running processes that are capable of updating the environment on runtime. The only process I know that does this is explorer.exe. NSIS doesn't do it and that's what you're seeing. For it to update immediately, you need to use the previous method you've used.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok. I can certainly live with that. It isn't important to the nsis installer that the environment variable got set ... the application is what cares.<br>
      <br>
      And THANKS VERY MUCH for the very timely, patient, and helpful replies.<br>
      <br>
      Just wondering, if the WriteEnvStr routine had a problem, would it be detected by IfErrors in the calling script? I didn't see any error handling in the WriteEnvStr.nsh code, but I'm not all that experienced at looking at nsis script.<br>
      <br>
      What would be the "best practices code" to make sure the environment variable was set (such as if an NT/Xp user didn't have admin privilege)?<br>
      <br>
      Would the following snippet be appropriate:<br>
      <br>
      Push "DID_IT_WORK"<br>
      Push "YES"<br>
      ClearErrors<br>
      Call WriteEnvStr<br>
      IfErrors WriteEnvStrProblem WriteEvnStrOk<br>
      <br>
      Or does WriteEnvStr.nsh fail "silently"?</p>
