Also find examples at wiki and here in this forum. You'll learn how to create custom pages, put controls on them, change controls, and so on. After that, reading values from registry, finding and comparing files and file versions, and finaly set up and run the whole thing would be the easy part of the job.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">TheHeartSmasher</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th December 2006 17:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Is there a way that I can get the license file downloaded like I can do all other programs using inetload?
