      <p class="post-content"><strong>Run Powershell script using NSIS</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I am creating a setup file to deploy sharepoint WebApplication. I will have to first create a web application on the IIS and SharePoint Farm. For this I have a Powershell script which will do all that for me. I wanted to execute this powershell script using nsis.<br />
      I tried this :<br />
      SetOutPath $INSTDIR\CGD<br />
      File Files\CGDirectSiteInstallation.ps1<br />
      Execwait "$INSTDIR\CGD\CGDirectSiteInstallation.ps1"<br />
      but I am not able to execute this PS1 file.<br />
      Also this PS1 file will accept some parameters which will be taken from user.<br />
      <br />
      Please let me know if I am doing anything wrong or how to execute this ps1 file?<br />
      Execution of this ps1 file should be silent.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks &amp; regards,<br />
      Mayur Mahajan</p>

      <p class="post-content">You only ExecWait executable files. Use ExecShell to open/launch a file with its default registered application.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Running SharePoint Powershell in NSIS</strong><br />
      Thanks a lot for the quick reply.<br />
      <br />
      <b>But I am getting some problem for running the ps1 file through NSIS. It is as follows :</b><br />
      I have used some SharePoint commands like "New-SPAuthenticationProvider" and "New-SPWebApplication". So while executng these commands it gives me following errors :<br />
      "The term 'New-SPAuthenticationProvider' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program."<br />
      <br />
      To make this execute properly I tried to execute Add-PSSnapin command which is as follows : "Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell".<br />
      After executing this command I am getting an error as :<br />
      Add-PSSnapin : No snap-ins have been registered for Windows PowerShell version 2<br />
      <br />
      I tried to get solution on google, but in vein.<br />
      <br />
      If I ran the same ps1 file through SharePoint Powershell then I didn't get any errors and the Web Application gets created successfully.<br />
      <br />
      Please suggest a way to get out of this. Is there any other method through which we can create web application on IIS as well as on SharePoint Farm?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thanks &amp; regards,<br />
      Mayur Mahajan.</p>

      I got my problem and meed some help in solving it.<br />
      The problem was, to run SharePoint commands I should run the SharePoint script in SharePoint Management shell. So I converted the windows powershell (the window which gets opened after executing ExceShell command) to SharePoint Management shell.<br />
      But for now the problem I am getting is, as the Windows Poershell gets converted to SharePoint Management Shell the window gets close. It should not get closed.<br />
      <br />
      Please suggest me solution for this or else suggest another way to create Web Application on IIS, while running the setup file.<br />
      <br />
      My requirement is when the setup starts it should create a new web application on IIS and then SharePoint Farm.<br />
      <br />
      Please do let me know about this. I have been doing work on this since very long time and the NSIS and NSIS is the last hope.

      <p class="post-content">Or else can you please suggest me how to open SharePoint Powershell (i.e. SharePoint Management Shell) directly.<br />
      I meant to say that, when we use ExecShell command then it opens Windows Powershell. So can we directly open the SharePoint Powershell (i.e. Sharepoint Management Shell)</p>
