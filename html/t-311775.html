      <p class="post-content"><strong>Binary created with NSIS is reported as a virus</strong><br />
      Our own Customers report that a binary "xxx.exe" is moved in the virus vault by Norton AV on Windows XP and Vista. I don't no the version of the signaturefile.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The binary does just grant full File Access (Windows ACL) to another File of our own software after installation. It was build with the NSIS-Installationframework (<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net</a>) with the AccessControll-Plugin.<br />
      <br />
      The codelines in the NSIS-Installerscript, where the xxx.exe is build from, are looking like these one:<br />
      <br />
      AccessControl::GrantOnFile "$4\${ACCESS_DIR}\${ACCESS_FILE}" "(S-1-5-11)" "FullAccess"<br />
      <br />
      The TargetFile is situated in c:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\ and in c:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\<br />
      <br />
      My Question: Does Norton AV declare ALL activities granting full Filepermissions as heuristic virus? Is that the reason cause our binary is marked as virus?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I doubt it's because of file permission granting. They usually just have false positive signatures created by their automatic systems. You should report this Norton fix prompt resolution.</p>
