As far as I can tell, all of the code is 'safe' - i.e. buffers get cleaned up where they should be.. but I'm still not an expert.<br><br>The crash only occurs when the installer shuts down, and is highly intermittent. In fact, I'm trying to see if I can get some details on the crash but I can't get the thing to crash now.<br><br>Is there something happening at installer shutdown where, presumably, system.dll gets unloaded or so and something I've forgotten could cause these crashes?<br><br>If you need code, I'll try and share as much as I can, but the all of the system calls used are the below (with minor modifications; e.g. Get_Local_Time adjusted to return a specific format instead of the hours/minutes/etc. on the stack; no changes to the system calls themselves).<br><br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Get_Local_Time" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Get_Local_Time</a><br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Refresh_shell_icons" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Refresh_shell_icons</a><br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Dump_log_to_file" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Dump_log_to_file</a><br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialogs_SetImageOLE" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialogs_SetImageOLE</a><br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Allow_only_one_installer_instance" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Allow_on...aller_instance</a><br><br>And...<br>Refresh a control:<br></p><pre>

The problem was that the finish page was based off of the welcome page. The welcome page uses the OLE image function to set a JPG file to a Bitmap control. To do so, a buffer has to be created for the image data, which must be cleared once done with it.<br><br>However, the finish page did not set this image.. but it was still clearing the buffer which was presumed to be in $0. The value of $0 could, of course, be just about anything at the time of installer end and the fact that I never saw the crash again is more likely to be 'luck' than anything else. The smaller installer always had $0 set to a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3 (depending on some test results) which I'm guessing the call in question would -always- cause to throw an error later.<br><br>Looks like this was a case of not seeing the forest for the trees; focusing on the stack and the integrity of the System calls themselves and completely missing the fact that System was called where (on something) it never should have been, no matter the integrity of the call itself.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
