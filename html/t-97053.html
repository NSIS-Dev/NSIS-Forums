Help! Help!</strong><br>I have quite a problem. I have a desire to write a large Mod for a game called Baulders Gate II : Shadows of Amn. To this end I thought it would be a good idea to download and experiment with one of the large Mods already out there. So, off I went to fileplanet.com and downloaded a huge file (The Darkest Day - 309 meg). When I attempted to run the tdd103full.exe, I got a message indicating the verification had failed, and that I could try again using the /NCRC switch. So I did this (and took note of the installer - NullSoft Install System v1.98). The installer started, created a backup folder and moved several files to it. Then, once it began to uncompress the first file it failed and gave me a message indicating that it was an installer problem. So, I restarted it and when I got to the install options part this time I only selected a small simple part to install, instead of the full Mod. As soon as it began to uncompress it failed, and I got the same message about a possible installer problem. Since it was a different file than failed the first time it seemed likely that it was actually an installer problem. I won't go through all the trials and tribulations of downloading a 300M file with a 56K connection, or the failed attempts which all add up to more like 750M, but I'm sure you can imagine. Anyway, with several days into this, I didn't want to give up, and I didn't want to start over (cough). So, I went to Nullsoft and downloaded the installer v1.98 and the extras in hope that I could somehow pull the .exe apart and either peel the installer portion off and replace it, or at least decompress the actual files and manually install them myself. I have studied programming a fair amount, and I couldn't see any way this was doable after reading through the documentation, but I don't know much about installers either, and I've never had much luck decompiling an exe anyway. So, back to fileplanet I went.<br>This time (with a little creativity) I was able to use NetVampire and download the whole thing in one shot - only 17 hours this time. Would you care to guess what happened? Yep, exactly the same thing - verification failed, used the /NCRC switch, failed with installer message, etc.... Well, to say I am unhappy is a fair understatement. To compound the problem I am moving in a couple of days and won't have access to the internet for awhile (one of the reasons I am downloading things to work on).<br>Anyway, now that you know the background of my problem, here are my questions.<br>1) Is there in fact any way to pull apart this .exe I have using NSIS? (or VB5 which is about all I currently have)<br>2) Could I somehow use another instance of the installer over the one in the .exe?<br>3) Is there any way to extract the actuall files themselves.<br>4) Does anybody else have any suggestions?<br>Thanx b.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th August 2002 20:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The usage of the /NCRC is, like mentioned in the message box itself, not recommended. If you have downloaded twice and it failed twice there are three options:<br>1) The message box is right and you have a virus, or a failing disk. [edit]On second thought, if you managed to install NSIS this can't be reason...[/edit]<br>2) The file it self is corrupted. I really doubt this one because the people that have created this mod would have picked on that kind of thing a long time ago.<br>3) Your internet connection is not reliable. Try talking to your ISP after testing the above two.<br><br>If the installer itself can't read its own data I doubt any outer utility would be able to do it.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
