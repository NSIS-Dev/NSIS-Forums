The built-in RunAs-dialog for Vista is english only. This dialog should be "multi-language" (e.g. by loading text strings from some ini file in $PLUGINSDIR).<br><br>2. Currently we do not a RunAs-dialog which allows all users etc. We always want the user to login using an admin account. So the dialog might be changed: other texts, maybe a combo box where (local?) admin usernames are pre-filled etc. The "current user" setting (radio selection) seems quite useless here.<br><br>3. The XP/2000-RunAs-dialog is not optimal for installers because it has worse defaults. A good own dialog (see points 1 and 2) for Vista could be used for XP/2000, too. The dialog should mention the need for elevation (so we do not need a messagebox with explaining texts before).<br>We just need some text explaining why this dialog appeared and what the user is expected to do, a possibility to enter a username (Administrator account should be preselected) and a password input field.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">stb</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th May 2007 15:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Just an idea: I don't know whether the system RunAs-dialog in Windows 2000/XP supports other authentication methods than password.

That code makes a <b>new process</b> and attempts to elevate it to admin mode. Anders calls the first process the outer process, and this second process the inner process.<br>3) If needed, a UAC or Run As dialog is shown. After that, the inner process should be elevated to admin access. Then this admin/inner process can display. This is the main installer app that users will see. At this time, two processes are running. One as a user, another as an admin.<br>4) Now that you have an admin process, you can continue to let your script do its thing. If you ever need to do something at a user level, you do it through the UAC plugin. For example, UAC::Exec can execute something with user privileges and not admin privileges.<br><br>With all this in place, you can do some system calls to create a shortcut as a user. Personally, I think the UAC plugin should have some extra features added on, such as UAC::CreateUserShortcut or something like that. But then, Anders has been working really hard on just getting the bugs worked out of the current plugin...I'm just happy he's providing a fairly clean solution compared to the really ugly alternatives out there in the Vista world.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">fishsauce</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th May 2007 06:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I see... thanks for the nice, detailed overview.

Here's another feature request (which is quite obvious):<br><br>Allow communication from outer to inner installer. It would be nice if the ExecCodeSegment could return values.

Or by exchanging values internally using some UAC stack (UAC::Push, UAC::Pop, callable by both instances). Or something else.<br><br>The outer installer runs with user privileges, so it is a bit difficult to exchange information using some workaround (registry location). They both use different TMP (pluginsdir). Perhaps there is a possibility via windows API.

I guess the RunAs dialog is an outer process thing.<br><br>Regarding security issue (passing values from outer to inner): I think about two ways:<br><br>a) the inner process has admin privileges. We could use this to let the inner process read those values out of the process context / environment /... of the outer one.<br><br>Very simple solution: create a temp file and pass the file to the inner process as CMD. So both processes could use this file. Problem: The privileges of the inner process could be insufficient. The file could be encrypted by EFS and the admin user would not have the key. So file is not good...<br><br>b) is the inner process technically a child process of the outer one?

          <p class="post-content">I understand a solution for the runas on systems without UAC or UAC is turned off would be a wonderful thing but that is highly unlikely from what I have read of other people's struggles with this (e.g. using task scheduler... I mean damn!). ;)<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand being able to launch an app at the end of uninstall (e.g. option to open a web page) which is typically not elevated through runas (e.g. ARP or Programs and Features) though on Vista with UAC turned on is elevated would be a good thing. If a 100% solution were possible I'd certainly go for it but without that I am willing to settle for good vs. perfect since perfect isn't an option from what I have read on this scenario.<br>
          <br>
          I'll probably just provide the option when the progman window is available to avoid using a random window and throw together a simple plugin to provide this when the target is Vista with UAC turned on.</p>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>UAC-Plugin - Multiple security warnings on Vista</strong><br>
          Hi,<br>
          <br>
          i have a problem with the UAC-plugin on vista.<br>
          <br>
          After i clicked the button on my web page to download my installer, vista is poping up first a "File Download - Security Warning" with information about Name, Type and From. I think this i normal behavior.<br>
          <br>
          After i confirm with clicking the "Run" button another security warning is poping up. This "Internet Explorer - Security warning" is asking if the software of a certain Name and Publisher is allowed to run. I think this is normal as well.<br>
          After i confirm "Run" i get a third security popup "Open File - Security Warning" which is asking if i want to run a file which is described with Name, Publisher, Type and where from. This file has the same name as my Installer except the installer name got a number suffix like Installer[2].exe and moreover it is stored under "c:\user\&lt;account&gt;\AppData\Microsoft\Wind...". Thats all what i can read from that path.<br>
          After i confirm the third installer and click on "Run" finally my installer window is coming up.<br>
          <br>
          I dont think the third security warning should come up. It would only confuse the user.<br>
          Can you confirm such behavior? Is that normal?<br>
          <br>
          Thank you for your help.<br>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>UAC-plugin security popups</strong><br>
          Hi Anders,<br>
          <br>
          before I included the UAC plugin in my script i only got the popup windows "File Download - Security Warning" for allowing to download and the "User Account Control" for running the installer. The disadvatage was that the installer window was not in focus after I confirmed the "User Account Control" window.<br>
          <br>
          So by using the UAC-plugin my installer window is now in focus when it got started, but i have all the security warnings inbetween. ( "Internet Explorer - Security warning" and "Open File - Security Warning"). Havent had these security warnings without the UAC.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore i was assuming the UAC raises such warnings.<br>

          <p class="post-content">The UAC plugin will start the SAME exe one more time, so you might get another IE warning dialog, I don't know. Make sure you are have "RequestExecutionLevel user" in your script. If you can post a minimal sample script with this problem I might be able to look into it and see if I can come up with a fix</p>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>Sample script</strong><br>
          Hi Anders,<br>
          <br>
          I attached a simple script which is utilizing the UAC plug-in.<br>
          I signed the created installer before tested it.<br>
          <br>
          The described problem with the multiple security warnings is not happening on Vista when you execute the installer direct from the hard drive.<br>
          <br>
          It only happens on Vista when you run the installer out of a web page what means it gets downloaded and executed by IE7 and JavaScript without saving it to the hard drive.<br>
          <br>
          I hope this will help you to figure out the problem.<br>
          <br>

          <p class="post-content">It still gets executed from the hard drive, just in the temporary internet files folder. I guess thats why you get the "c:\user\&lt;account&gt;\AppData\Microsoft\Wind..." path in the dialog, and the name installer[2].exe would indicate that this is the 2nd time you "ran it from a website". I'm not sure how any of this is related to UAC, other than the fact that you might get one extra warning from IE. It might be possible to check if $exedir is the temporary internet files folder and to copy your installer to $temp and then execute that.</p>

          For example if I run my simple test installer out of a web page without UAC-plugin i get the warnings:<br>
          - "File Download - Security Warning" download/run permission<br>
          - "User Account Control" elevate process<br>
          <br>
          With UAC-plugin and basically the same test installer i get:<br>
          - "File Download - Security Warning" download/run permission<br>
          - "Internet Explorer - Security warning" run inst. as user<br>
          - "Open File - Security Warning" run installer as admin<br>
          - "User Account Control" elevate process<br>
          <br>
          There must be a way that you can use the UAC-plugin with only the 2 security warnings as stated above.<br>
          Otherwise it could easily scare users away with so many warnings.<br>

          <p class="post-content">nope, I don't think there is anything I can do. If you copy your installer out of temporary internet files and into $temp AND remove the "mark of the internet" (NTFS stream) you might be able to get rid of two warnings (you must do this before calling the uac plugin in .OnInit). Signing your installer might also help. This is a IE only issue that I don't really care about to be honest (you could also wrap your real installer inside a smaller one that just extracts the real thing to $pluginsdir/$temp and executes it)</p>

          When using the plugin the UAC dialog comes up minimized. This is bad because the user might miss it, even though it is flashing in the task bar. Once I click on the UAC icon I get the normal modal dialog with the desktop darkened.<br>

          <p class="post-content">Nice work on the UAC plug-in Anders ;). I have been using it for several months, allowing me to perform a post-install launch without propagating the high privileges of the installer to the child process.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, I have encountered a problem with the UNICODE build (built here /w VS2008). I am using it in conjunction with the UNICODE build of NSIS. I do not know which is at fault, but I suspect first the UAC plug-in.<br>
          <br>
          I am getting a general failure in Windows x64 (unable to elevate). It appears to work in x32, though I have did have one user report of a failure to elevate for the x32 build -- leaving me unconfident.<br>
          <br>
          I intend to so some debugging soon, but I figured I would ask here to see if anyone else has seen this, or if anyone is using this combination successfully for installations in Windows Vista+ x64.<br>

          <p class="post-content">Nevermind all.. My build of the UAC plug-in was bad. VS2008 had pulled in the CRT due to buffer security checks being enabled, and I had accidentally linked to the DLL version of it. This therefore caused a UAC.DLL load error on systems where the CRT DLLs weren't installed. Duh! Problem solved. I should have looked closer before posting here.<br>
          <br>
          After removing the CRT dependency, all was well. My unicode build of the UAC plug-in ended up being 19KB, only 2KB larger than the official multi-byte distribution of it.<br>
          <br>
          I can say now that the UAC plug-in definitely works great with the unicode build of NSIS ;).</p>

          <br>
          I really appreciate your work on this plugin. Without it, I would have had to quit using NSIS.

          Congratulations on the work you have done on the UAC plugin.<br>
          <br>
          One strange problem I have encountered is as follows:<br>
          Windows 7 RC 1<br>
          A non-admin user<br>
          The install elevates and installs successfully using an admin user as the inner process. If I uninstall via Start Programs it elevates and works correctly. The paths are correctly identified via UAC as the outer user. However if I uninstall via the Control Panel (same nsi code and uninstall.exe) it elevates, but the install fails as the paths for the Data directory, the desktop icon and start menus are the inner (elevated admin) process and not the (outer) user.<br>
          <br>
          If I run on XP both uninstall routes (Start menu and Control panel) elevate and work successfuly for a non-admin user.<br>
          <br>
          I have worked on the problem for some time, but no luck.<br>
          Any help would be much appreciated.<br>
          <br>
          It may well be a Windows 7 problem - I am about to submit as a problem to Microsoft. Any thoughts?<br>

          <p class="post-content">Vista and 7 will force the elevation for you IIRC (I'm sure this only happens when you put the uninstall info in HKLM)<br>
          <br>
          You should stop creating stuff as the user and do a pure all users install (HKLM &amp; SetShellVarContext all) if you don't want to deal with problems like this (Using the UAC plugin to launch a program during install is fine, anything else means your installer is broken and you will have issues like this)</p>

          <p class="post-content">Anders, you seem to be saying that NSIS + UAC plugin is broken if you try a user install. Do you really mean this, as it seem to me that the inconsistent behaviour on Windows 7 (uninstall.exe works via the start menu shortcuts, but fails through the Control Panel)is more likley a Windows bug? It's as though the windows 'executation context' of uninstall.exe, when launched via the Control Panel is different from that when done via the start menu. (I don't have a Vista system handy, so have not yet tried this on Vista.)</p>

          <p class="post-content">Well, it depends on what you mean by user install (In a real single user install, you would not call into the UAC plugin to perform operations since you are already running as the correct user and you will only write to HKCU and the users profile, not in HKLM or $programfiles)<br>
          <br>
          I would not call this problem a windows bug even tho starting from a shortcut is not the same as starting from the control panel, since, if the uninstall info is in HKLM, you did a "all users" install and you will require admin rights to uninstall so windows just "helps you along"<br>
          <br>
          So, if you run into this problem, it probably means you did a "mixed install" and this has never been correct (I know the UAC plugin really helps you do this, but it was not the original intent of the plugin, its only "supported" function is to run programs during install, not to create files or do any special action at all during uninstall)</p>

          <p class="post-content">Anders - thanks for such quick replies.<br>
          I take your point about the mixed install, which is not a good idea and I think I am guilty of doing this inadvertently. Also, the subtlety that the uninstall.exe was created with the correct paths (during the elevated install) had escaped me.<br>

          I've a question regarding the UAC plugin and creating a Mutex to find out if the installation program is already running.<br>
          <br>
          As far as I noticed the program is going to be run twice - in normal mode and in admin mode, if you confirm it. So if I create a mutex in onInit, it will be executed twice and then fail.<br>

          <br>
          thanks a lot for the great plugin! But I have troubles with UAC_AsUser_ExecShell / ExecShell - I want to execute an application as user but with administrative rights, because the launched application is storing some information in %APPDATA%.<br>

          - If I use ExecShell the information are stored in the administrators %APPDATA%<br>
          <br>
          - If I user UAC_AsUser_ExecShell the information are stored in the users %APPDATA% BUT the application is not running in admin mode, so I can't changes files within my launched application.<br>

          Is there a way to run the application in admin mode but using the users scope variables?<br>

            I want to execute an application as user but with administrative rights, because the launched application is storing some information in %APPDATA%.
          </blockquote>This is not possible. Either it's running as admin, or it's running as user. It can never be both at the same time.<br>
          <br>
          However, there is an easy solution to your problem: Use the UAC plugin to call a function as user (and make sure to use SYNCREGISTERS), and in that function copy the value of $APPDATA to a register:<br>
          <br>
          Function SyncAppdata<br>
          setshellvarcontext current<br>
          StrCpy $0 $APPDATA<br>
          FunctionEnd<br>
          <br>
          This way, you'll have the user's appdata path stored in $0, in the inner (admin) instance of your installer. Then, you can simply supply that user-appdata path as a commandline parameter to your application.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Edit: Here's two macros I created to do something similar, namely synching the contents of a variable, and synching the flags of sections, from outer to inner: <a href="http://pastebin.com/eM9MDUYL" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/eM9MDUYL</a> (Note that you shouldn't sync the $APPDATA variable using that syncvariable macro, because then the admin's $appdata will point to the wrong path. But you can modify it to suit your needs.)
