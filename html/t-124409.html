      <p class="post-content"><strong>Compiling DLL's</strong><br />
      I have been twiddling with DLL's for Regina/Rexx and I started out using one of the samples and then ran riot from there... :D<br />
      <br />
      Trying to do somethings for NSIS (as that's what we have decided to use for ditributing our free Trainz scenarios).<br />
      <br />
      I am trying to compile advsplash with bcc but seem to have brain lock, tried to install mingw and brain exploded :eek: would someone be able to give me the bcc32/linker lines that should give me a workable DLL, then I can cause havoc from there.<br />
      <br />
      Looked in the conference and couldn't see anything dealing with compiling the DLL's perhaps I am just trying too hard with too many things at once ..<br />
      <br />
      Thanks .. Larry</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can't help you with bcc but I can confirm that advSplash compiles fine using VC6 (SP5). Maybe you already know this, but I read your message as though you'd only tried bcc and not VC, and you didn't say you can't use VC. Anyhow probably a useless response, I'm tired, good night :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't have VC, finally managed to get BCC to build advsplash but it is now huge like 52k (ug), still have not tried mingw really do ot want another compiler.<br />
