I searched the forum, but didn't find anything exactly like this.<br><br>My 'Modern UI' EXE install runs fine on XP. On Vista it runs fine <b>except</b> that it does not create the desktop shortcut unless I right-click the EXE and 'Run as Administrator'. (I am logged in as a user with Admin priviledges.) I thought maybe I needed the NSIS UAC plugin so the script could create the shortcut as Administrator, but after downloading and reading everything, sounds like the user running the install needs the desktop shortcut, not the Administrator, which is the way it is already configured. The user I am logged in as when I run the install can manually create desktop shortcuts without a problem. The script has the code to request user application privileges:<br><br>;Request application privileges for Windows Vista<br>RequestExecutionLevel user<br><br>So I'm confused. Any help would be appreciated. Haven't tried it on Windows 7, but am guessing the same issue would occur. This is NSIS version 2.46.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Ken</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Anders</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th November 2010 16:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Did you call "SetShellVarContext all"?

      <p class="post-content">Don't use SetShellVarContext all. Also why do you have CreateDirectory "\myApp"? You should never use relative paths.<br>

      </blockquote>No it works exactly the same, you just failed to test on XP as non admin

      <p class="post-content">Actually, the test I did on XP was done the same way as the test I did on Vista. As a standard user, but with 'Computer Administrator' privileges. That's why I was confused about the inconsistent results. I'll remove 'SetShellVarContext all' and start another round of testing. (Thought I started with one of the Modern UI examples, but none of them use that command, so not sure where I got the code that has it. Has been a while since I built the script and it has been working for everyone doing XP installs.)<br>

      <p class="post-content">"As a standard user, but with 'Computer Administrator' privileges" what does that even mean? A standard (aka limited, normal) user is not a member of the administrators group.</p>

      Looking at the user which is logged on and running the install script:<br>
      <br>
      jsmith<br>
      Computer Administrator<br>
      Password Protected<br>
      <br>
      This is XP. I'll have to check the Vista machine which had the issue (can't get to it until Monday), but I purposely set it up the same way, so I would expect similar attributes for the user. Administrator privileges means that it is a user other than 'Administrator' which has been given the 'Computer administrator' type instead of 'Limited' type. (Those are the only 2 options at account setup.)</p>
