Therefore, when you build containing Uninstall source as well you cannot re-define it like:<br><br>Name "$(un.PRODUCT_NAME) $(un.PRODUCT_EDITION)"<br><br>This causes the uninstall to not detect the "!insertmacro MUI_UNGETLANGUAGE" macro.<br><br>I looked through the documentation and the forum and did not find UnName or any other work around. Does anyone know how I can get around this?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>ZIMSMS</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">28th January 2004 16:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Which version of NSIS are you using?

The issue still persists. I believe I have an explanation. The Name definition(see above) always starts out in the os specified format since it's a langstring, which is fine. However, if I install as french on an english box the name parameter isn't re-evaluated before the call to MUI_UNGETLANGUAGE, so it's default state is the current os version therefore it doesn't know that it should be looking for the french product name, when evaluating MUI_UNGETLANGUAGE.<br><br>so for example during the install:<br>1. I am on an english OS and choose a french install.<br>2. The name that gets placed in the add-remove is the french product name, like it should.<br>3. I perform an uninstall, when it first goes to obtain the installed language it is looking for the english product name, therefore, not finding the french product name, and displaying the language dialog.<br><br>Option A: Maybe the MUI_UNGETLANGUAGE should evaluate each of the defined language product names?<br><br>Option B: Any ideas on a simple way to resolve this?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">28th January 2004 21:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">So you have the langauge stored in a language specific registry key. That doesn't really make sense does it? I see no reason for a registry key to be language specific, it only causes troubles.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
