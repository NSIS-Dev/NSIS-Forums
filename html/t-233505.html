      <p class="post-content"><strong>Flash.ocx does not get installed</strong><br />
      I am installing flash.ocx using:<br />
      !insertmacro InstallLib REGDLL $ALREADY_INSTALLED REBOOT_PROTECTED "${REDISTRIB}\MACROMED\FLASH\Flash.ocx" "$SYSDIR\MACROMED\FLASH\Flash.ocx" "$SYSDIR"<br />
      <br />
      My other dlls install ok using a similar directive. The flash.ocx does not get put into the target's "install after reboot" list or anything, the file does not even get copied, let alone registered.<br />
      <br />
      Target does not have any version of flash installed. Does InstallLib require that sysdir\macromed\flash exist on the target?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it's a really bad idea for anyone to try to repackage someone else's installs on a file-by-file basis. Rather, you should require that the end-user already have Flash installed, or you should include the Flash installer in your installer. You can then unpack it to $PLUGINSDIR and run it with an ExecWait statement.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Um, the fact that it is flash.ocx was mentioned so that anyone who knows about InstallLib would say it is special cased, if it is.<br />
      <br />
      The specific question is "do we need to create the subdirectory off winsys so InstallLib will copy and register it?".<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When I was using the old vb Package Wizard, it found the flash.ocx and installed/registered it correctly. It did not see any dependencies. (I switched to NSIS for many other reasons).<br />
      <br />
      When this installer runs, and app is started, it gets run time error due to no flash.ocx. Copying the flash.ocx file and registering it fixes it.<br />
      <br />
      This installer is not intended for general distribution to an end user in the conventional sense (i.e. cannot demand that they get flash). It is for setting up app on a special purpose machine. When installing in the factory, they have the CD but no internet access. Macromedia distros are mostly internet based.</p>

      <p class="post-content">And the answer is: if the directory under system32 exists, the ocx will be extracted into it and registered. If directory does not exist, it says "skipped" and fails to register.</p>
