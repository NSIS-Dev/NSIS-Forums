I would like to know: If more than one parameter is optional, can i omit other parameters, when I only like to set the last one?<br>- You should document the usefull function GetWindowText (used in System.nsh).<br>- I can hand over more than one parameter to CallInstDll. The second one must be something like functionname. It's is not yet in the documentation.<br>- Apparently is is not possible to call SendMessage with WM_SETTEXT and the first parameter as LangString variable. Even if it begins with "STR:". It only works that way:</p><pre>
<code>SendMessage&lt;ID&gt; ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 "STR:$(LangString)" 
</code>
</pre>. Please add that info.<br>- More information about SetRebootFlag? Is it only a variable or does the setup automatically reboot, if this flag is set? Is there a MessageBox asking the user, what to do?<br>- Modern User Interface: Add docu about !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_PUSH. Does the second parameter always have to be the lang. name in English?<br><br>Things regarding the code:<br>- One function should be able to be called from Install as well as Uninstall. That's not possible because every function called from Uninstall must begin with "un.".<br>- What about a function setting these entries in the registry. They add Uninstall information the the Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove Software. Especially the items NoRepair/NoModify made the "(only remove)" string unnecessary.<br><pre>
<code>
Windows
<br>WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "DisplayName" "${MUI_PRODUCT} ${MUI_VERSION}"
<br>&gt;WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "UninstallString" '"$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe"'
<br>&gt;WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "Publisher" "Konrad Windszus"
<br>&gt;WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "URLInfoAbout" "http://www.wincd.de"
<br>&gt;WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "URLUpdateInfo" "http://www.wincd.de"
<br>&gt;WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "HelpLink" "http://www.wincd.de"
<br>&gt;WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "DisplayVersion" "${MUI_VERSION}"
<br>&gt;WriteRegDWORD HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "NoModify" 1
<br>WriteRegDWORD HKLM"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD" "NoRepair" 1 
<br>&gt;
</code>
</pre>- I would like to have another standard page for displaying readme files. I made changes to the license page, but that's very complicated. It should be also a rich edit control.<br>
      - Another page with checkboxes for desktop and quicklaunch shortcuts would also be very nice. I made one page and I will supply it in the Archive.<br>
      - Last small thing. If you insert custom pages, the caption should start with ":" to be uniform to the others. Perhaps you could automatically add the ":" that the caption is only the raw caption like "Installation Folder" in DirPage.<br>
      <br>
      At least thank you very much for that great work! NSIS is definitely the best installer for small projects!

      <ul>
        <li>Agreed. It's currently a pretty big mess. If a string that starts with / is marked as optional it's really optional. If it doesn't start with / it's usually required if you want to use the next optional parameter (such as in the Page command for example).</li>

        <li>This command is only a temporary solution for the branding text problem. It won't stay in the next version. Therefore it's not documented.</li>

        <li>You must add anoter parameter. It's a typo. Will be fixed.</li>

        <li>Why would you want to send the string as the first parameter? WM_SETTEXT expects the string as the second one.</li>

        <li>The reboot flag should be used by the developer. NSIS doesn't do anything automatically for you. The new modern UI adds a checkbox to the finish page (if exists) if the reboot flag is on.</li>

        <li>I will ask Joost about this.</li>

        <li>NSIS 3.</li>

        <li>What function? What's wrong with writing those lines?</li>

        <li>This will be avaiable in 2.0b2 (b1 should be out this weekend).</li>

        <li>It's so easy to do this with InstallOptions, there is no need to make it a generic NSIS page.</li>

        <li>That's up to the user. Some users might want to spereate the product name from the page name with a dash instead of colon.</li>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you for the quick answer.<br>
      - SendMessage with WM_SETTEXT and the second parameter as LangString variable (it was a typo in the first topic) doesn't work. Only "STR:$(LANGSTRING)" does. Why?<br>
      - The reboot flag should be used in an example. If i set the reboot flag to true and in the MUI there is a checkbox. What if the user deselects the checkbox. Is the reboot flag then set to false. When (in which function in MUI) should I call Reboot? Is the setup closed first? You should add some more infos or an examle regarding this topic!</p>

      <p class="post-content">This one actually <b>is</b> documented :)<br></p>

      <blockquote>
        To send a string param, put STR: before the parameter, for example: "STR:Some string".
      </blockquote>As a $(something) translates into a string and you want to use it as a string you must put STR: infront of it. If you don't, it will treat it as a number.<br>
      <br>
      Yep, the reboot checkbox is documented in the MUI docs. We'll add it.<br>
      In the MUI if when it reaches the finish page and the reboot flag is on, it will present the user with two options - to reboot now, or later. If the user chooses now the MUI will reboot. If you are not using the MUI you will have to reboot yourself in .onInstSuccess for example.

      <p class="post-content">I don't know whether is already is, but you, Konrad, should post your 'Uninstallkeys for Windows' sample in the Archive. (no KiCHiK, why I don't do it? Because it's his code!) And maybe KiCHiK can include a small sample in the NSIS package which uses this code.</p>
