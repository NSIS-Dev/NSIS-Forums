      This works for all sections, but not for the RO section. It still shows up after it's installed, with description and everything, and I don't want that, because it could confuse the user into thinking he/she didn't install it afterall.<br>

      <p class="post-content">OK I'll look through it again.<br>
      <br>
      However - it works if I remove the "SectionIn RO" from the section, making it selectable again. Should I not use "SectionIn RO" below the Section name? Isn't that the only way?<br>
      All the other selectable sections are hidden when they are installed, using the code I have now.<br>
      <br>
      I'm using the latest build.<br>
      <br>
      [edit]I tried it now - the only change I made to the script now was to remove SectionIn RO from the section, then I saved it and compiled it. Once installed, the option then doesn't appear in the installer when it's reopened. So the only difference is the SectionIn RO thing.[/edit]</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well - I've tried to cut it down to it's bare essentials, but it's a big script, and there's a whole lot of stuff that depends on other stuff so it's hard to cut things out without getting errors.<br>
      <br>
      So I'll try to post the most essential parts that has to do with this problem instead.<br>
      <br>
      First, one of the sections(the one I'm having problems with):<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code>Section "Testing testing." Sec01<br>SectionIn RO<br>SetDetailsPrint textonly<br>DetailPrint "Extracting And Installing Files... Please Wait."<br>SetDetailsPrint none<br>ReadRegStr $0 HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "01"<br>        ${if} $0 == 1<br>Goto AlreadyInstalled<br>${endif}<br><b>LOTS OF STUFF DOWN HERE, BUT NOT IMPORTANT, JUST FILES TO EXTRACT ETC.</b></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      then on to <b>.onInit</b>:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>        ReadRegStr $0 HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "01"<br>        ${if} $0 == 1<br>                !insertmacro UnselectSection ${Sec01}<br>                SectionSetText ${Sec01} ""<br>        ${endif}</code>
</pre><br>
      (one of those for each section)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Then there's <b>-post</b>:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>Section -post<br>ReadRegStr $0 HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "01"<br>        ${if} $0 == 1<br>Goto +4<br>${else}<br>SectionGetFlags ${Sec01} $0<br>        WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "01" $0<br>${endif}</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      (one of those for each section)<br>
      <br>
      And I have some similar ones in the un.onInit and un.post parts of the script.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And in each of the uninstall sections, there's one of these:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "01" "0"</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      That's all I can see that can play any part in the problem.<br>
      <br>
      Again - what I want is for the installed sections to disappear from the components page when the installer is <i>reopened</i>. This <i>works</i> already, for all sections, even the one I'm having problems with. The ONLY thing that mucks things up, is if I add the <b>SectionIn RO</b> to the section. Then, when it's installed and I reopen the installer, it's still there. If I REMOVE only the <b>SectionIn RO</b> line, save and compile, ALL sections are gone from the installer when reopened (as I want them to be), if all the components were installed.

      <p class="post-content">Couldn't find any errors there, except you could change the -post Section code to make it a little cleaner:<br></p>
      <pre>

</pre><br>
      However, that shouldn't fix anything.<br>
      <br>
      Please attach your whole script (as file attachment).<br>

      </blockquote>OK - I think I've found the problem. I opened the registry, and for some strange reason, the first entry says 17, when it's supposed to say 1. So there's obviously something in the script I have overlooked. It should say either 1 or 0 (installed or not installed), so I don't know where 17 comes from...<br>
      <br>
      But I think I'll be able to solve it now anyway.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for the tips and help, both of you.

      <p class="post-content">Actually I still don't get it.<br>
      <br>
      When the ONLY thing I do to the script is to remove the line <b>SectionIn RO</b> from the first section, then save and compile, and run the installer, then suddenly the registry entry says 1 for that section, which it's supposed to do.<br>
      <br>
      -How can the registry setting go from 17 to 1 just because I remove <i>one</i> unrelated line from the script??<br>
      <br>
      I'm sorry, but I won't put the script up here(could e-mail or PM it to someone though). If it's impossible to solve then, I'll just have to do it some other way. After all, it <i>does</i> work as long as I don't make a section Read Only...</p>
