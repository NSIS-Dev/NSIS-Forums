      <p class="post-content"><strong>Process Plugins that work with Vista</strong><br />
      I am having a problem with the process addons I have attempted to use I am not sure if it is because of Vista or not but there is no logical reason that the code shouldn't work.<br />
      <br />
      The ones i've tried so far are<br />
      Processes.dll<br />
      FindProcDLL.dll<br />
      KillProcDLL<br />
      nsProcess.dll<br />
      <br />
      All I want is for NSIS to detect if blah.exe is running and if it is to tell the user to exit the program and retry or cancel the installation for a later time.<br />
      <br />
      Every attempt I have made with the Forementioned Plugins has allowed me to continue installation without a warning despite the fact that the process i'm trying to detect is running.<br />
      <br />
      I am running Windows Vista Ultimate 32bit, I can only assume it is a compatability issue with Vista because I have not been able to try on other versions of Windows.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What is the error code that you get when you call those plugins? Each of these should push something on the NSIS stack...<br />

      <p class="post-content">I know this won't help much :), but I can confirm that what you are trying to do is possible with Windows Vista. We currently use the Processes plugin, and I haven't had any problems with it killing the requested process.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe you're trying to kill a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/vista/process_Vista.mspx" target="_blank">protected process</a>? That should be impossible with any plug-in or code.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Perhaps its an Error on my part</strong><br />
      Well I am not trying to kill a process just find out if its working perhaps i scripted this wrong i'll attach the way i've been using it with no luck.<br />
      <br />
      Function .onInit<br />
      ReadRegStr $R1 HKLM "SOFTWARE\Program Manufacturer\Program To Search For\" "InstallPath"<br />
      <br />
      StrCmp $R1 "" ProgNotFound ProgFound<br />
      <br />
      ProgNotFound:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "The Program this installer needs is not installed on this computer. You must install it to continue with this installation."<br />
      Quit<br />
      <br />
      ProgFound:<br />
      loop:<br />
      Processes::FindProcess "Prog"<br />
      StrCmp $R0 1 0 done<br />
      <br />
      MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "The Program this installer needs is running on this computer. You must close it to continue with this installation."<br />
      Quit<br />
      <br />
      done:<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      If this is not correct please let me know it was put together from example script i have found on the web.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I am having a similiar problem. I suspect that the FindProcDLL has problems working with Vista because my problem doesn't appear in XP. Did anybody resolve this problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe the installer is elevated and FindProcDLL doesn't find processes created by the elevating user? Try <i>RequestExecutionLevel user</i> and see if it works in that case.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have a problem with the Processes addon and Vista as well.<br />
      <br />
      I have Vista x64.<br />
      Processes finds 32-bit processes OK, but not 64-bit.<br />
      <br />
      Has anybody found a way to find both 32- and 64-bit processes?</p>
