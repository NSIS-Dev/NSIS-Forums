      <p class="post-content">I've found another problem with your version deguix:<br>
      The language ZipDLL uses is no longer set automatically. The reason is that you're using !define LANG_$LANGUAGE, however !define is evaluated a compile time, but the $LANGUAGE variable is set during runtime.<br>
      You won't be able to come around using strcmp and including all possible languages.</p>

      <p class="post-content">When you !define a variable, it is like a "name" for it.<br>
      <br>
      I did LANG_$LANGUAGE, that will change everytime the $LANGUAGE is changed. I can change 1033 to 1046 to change the LANG_$LANGUAGE that was LANG_1033 to LANG_1046.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Please try the attaced test script.<br>
      <br>
      With define you define constants which do not change at runtime.<br>
      <br></p>

      <blockquote>
        When you !define a variable, it is like a "name" for it.
      </blockquote>Not excactly, that only works if you assign a value to a define, like<br>
      !define VARNAME $1<br>
      <br>
      I'm no expert on this either, but I'll try to explain how defines work:<br>
      LANG_$LANGUAGE is evaluated at compile time. I'm not completely sure, but i think you can use almost any characters (except spaces) in the names for defines.<br>
      Variables instead are only evaluated during runtime. After compiling the installer, all !defines, !undef !ifdef etc.. have been removed as well as all code between !ifdefs where the flag was not set. Also, in all other occurances of defines, they have been replaced with their constant value (constants like numbers, strings or the name of a variable, but never the contents of a variable)

        <blockquote>
          I've also added some ifdefs around each language to check whether the language has been included in NSIS at all. (Using the LANG_LANGNAME macros)
        </blockquote>You made the exactly same mistake I fixed in my first submited file:<br>
        <br>

        <blockquote>
          - Supports any UI, not just Modern UI as old versions.
        </blockquote>Forget about Modern UI, you're doing this include file for every UI (LANG_ENGLISH is a Modern UI define).<br>
        <br>
        I re-fixed the file with those additional languages included.<br>
        <br>
        <b>NOTE:</b> The new languages are Polish, Korean and Russian.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MESSAGE:</b> Remember, every user will be thankfull if they see an installer fully translatable in their languages. <b>Please, submit a new ZipDLL plugin translation here!</b>
