But why would you want to do this? What's so bad about putting a define in your scripts? They're all compiletime instructions, so it doesn't matter for eventual installer size or whatever.<br><br>2: The Next etc buttons are outside of the page space, so to edit it you'll have to edit the interface. You'll need to use resource editor for that (search the forums). But what you're suggesting is not really compliant with how wizard installers are supposed to look, and it's probably much easier to just create a custom page (nsDialogs).</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th April 2011 14:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I'd add the check box to the welcome page itself.

I figure if all of the sub_text require the same event happening, it'd be a smarter move to just loop through all of them rather than one at a time.<br><br><br><blockquote><small>Originally posted by Afrow UK</small><br>I'd add the check box to the welcome page itself.

<code>nsDialogs::CreateControl BUTTON ${BS_AUTOCHECKBOX}|${WS_VISIBLE}|${WS_CHILD}|${WS_TABSTOP}|${WS_EX_WINDOWEDGE}|${WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE} 0 100 320 170 15 "Custom installation"<br></code>

      I tried coding the Y to go off the edge of the main section into where the cancel is, but that didn't work either. Any ideas? Thank you~!

      <p class="post-content">It is impossible to add component apart from inner dialog area!<br>
      Window cannot hadle events outside of it's rect. For nsDialogs this rect is 300*140 (ID 1018 or 1044)<br>
      Try adding checkbox manually using ResHacker and hide it on next page.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hence why I said add it to the welcome page itself. The outer dialog is NOT part of the welcome page. You cannot modify it using nsDialogs. As said already, if you must have it next to the navigation buttons (i.e. the outer dialog / $HWNDPARENT) then add it to the UI using resource hacker. Also, when working with nsDialogs, use the macros (i.e. ${NSD_Create*}.<br>
