However, a few need to change this top directory to D: or even a directory (like E:\system\deploy).<br>In the installation procedure that problem would be easy to solve. I could show a page with a button that shows a directory dialog, as I have seen in the examples directory shiped with NSIS.<br>But, after the first install, users need only to upgrade (this is performed many times). In the upgrader (a completely different program) I would like to check if the default directory was used in the installation, if not, then use a dialog to let the user choose the correct directory.<br>I could use the Windows registry to save the installation dir, but most clients never use the installer (and this is desired, the possibility to not use the installer).<br>I could resume the question like this: How to create an if statement that shows a choose directory dialog<br><br>Thanks for the attention, and sorry for typing too much text. Any help is appreciated.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Wizou</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd September 2007 14:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">If they don't use the installer, how do they install ?

The installer is quite recent in my company. Most clients installed the application in the old fashion. I could not distribute the installer instead of the upgrader for some reasons:<br>- Installer is much bigger due to support third-party software<br>- They do different things (installer create databases, create users, create services)<br><br>I could use a page with the directory button always, but I would like to make the upgrader the most automatic as possible (nowdays the user just run it and receive a confirmation message if everything was ok, it is fully automatic).<br><br>Thanks.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Wizou</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd September 2007 15:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You didn't answer my second question..<br>If the user installed the application manually by unzipping it, how will you know the application folder ?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">gustavo-serra</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd September 2007 15:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Oh, sorry.<br><br>There is a default installation directory.
