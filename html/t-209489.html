        Client's machine has a Windows 2000 Advanced Server in Chinese with SP4. We have tried it in a Windows 2000 Advanced Server in Spanish with SP4 and it works fine<br />

        Have you ever heard about nsExec problems like this?<br />
        <br />
        Thanks</b>
      </blockquote>I have a similar problem that I can't resolve for a week. My install script makes four subsequent ExecWait calls and on my desktop the last hangs up Windows in a very strange way - I can switch between applications, but I can't use exlorer, can't kill setup from task manager, can't start any new application. The only way to make system work is to reboot. I don't know whether this caused by incorrect external applications that I call or by ExecWait but seems that they both since I've tried to change the order of calls and the system hangs up on the fourth ExecWait call again.<br />
      Any ideas how to understand why?

      <p class="post-content">I've found the same problem. nsExec::Exec hangs sometimes on some long processes. An example of this is in my NSIS Self-Extractor kit with Zip-To-SE or Dir-To-SE. Sometimes they hang when calling makensis.exe. makensis completes, but nsExec doesn't realise, and keeps waiting... forever!<br />
      Note that this is with ::Exec not ::ExecToLog. I haven't tried with ExecToLog.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Afrow, he's talking about ExecWait. That's why I split it from the original nsExec thread. If you have a reproducable problem with nsExec, open another thread about it with all of the details.</p>
