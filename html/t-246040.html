      So during the install, the user doing the install, does have Administration rights and that profile for Joe does exist.</p>

      <blockquote>

      <p class="post-content">I can't install this as Joe or impersonate him :-)<br>
      <br>
      What I'm going to try now, is a batch solution, if I get that to work, then I may try to create a plugin for NSIS and incorporate that logic.</p>

      </blockquote>???<br>
      <br>
      Is 'Joe' the disabled account or not?<br>
      <br>
      If yes, how about this:<br>
      Start the installation as some admin user. Enable Joe + add admin privileges. Then create a token in Joe's sec context and swap to that context, create the shortcut then kill the token (ie revert to the initial admin user), strip Joe's admin privileges, disable him, then go on with the rest of the installation.<br>
      <br>
      I can provide the impersonation part of the code, I have written something similar and works as stated above<br>

      <p class="post-content">Joe is not the disabled account, but the user that ultimately uses the application after reboot.<br>
      <br>
      There is a different disabled account, that gets enabled, receives admin rights, does the install, admin rights are taken away, and the account is disabled, then the computer reboots.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Is Joe an active account? Do you know his password? Can you use something like LogonUser to get a token for Joe then create the shortcut using Joe's security context? Or is it some random account that you need to create a shortcut in its profile folder? If you know the password you can impersonate the user, if not I see the problem :)<br>
