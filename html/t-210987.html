      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS vs IzPack</strong><br />
      Hi All,<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I have been working on NSIS for the past one week and found it very useful. Writing PHP sort of code for every page u want for Installer is also nice but time-consuming.<br />
      <br />
      I did not find much help from "Windows Help File" supplied with NSIS regarding "Creating Custom Pages". Help File need to be elaborated more and the Examples too.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, I am thinking of shifting from NSIS to IzPack. if somebody has earlier worked on IzPack, tell me which it cant do....<br />
      <br />
      Note: All I want is to install Tables on a Remote Oracle. i.e. I need to run SQL Files on Remote Computer(may be using Telnet or may be using someother simple technique).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Bye<br />
      <br />

      Talk about light-weight :-)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Oh yes, "light weight"...<br />
      <br />
      Even NSIS is "light weight". it has a foot print of just 32KB.<br />
      <br />
      I think, the main difference is NSIS uses "PHP-like language" whereas IzPack uses "ANT-like Scripts" i.e. XML Files.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>LOL???<br />
      i'd call it rather batch-like or asm-like.<br />
      it has nothing to do with php (except the var-symbol $).

      <p class="post-content">The NSIS script language is inspired from a lot of other script/batch languages. You can't just say it draws it's structures from one other particular design.<br />
      <br />
      I like NSIS because it's so generic in it's form. You can do just about anything if you use your imagination.<br />
      The plugin architecture is great but not unique to NSIS.<br />
      InstallShield always had support for plugins to be used in extending the installer with new pages and setup routines.<br />
      The most typical plugin used within InstallShield installers is a CD-Key/Product key verification plugin.<br />
      InstallShield also had support for device driver installation at a very early stage something NSIS is lacking support for. You can make an NSIS installer which installs a device driver by making it execute a .INF file but that again uses Windows INF script engine to to the work (i'm not sure what it's really called).<br />
      <br />
      If you're going to run SQL queries you may write a plugin tailored for that task but that again requires the knowledge of languages like C, C++ and/or Delphi.</p>
