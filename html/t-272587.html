To change the focus after the validation routine fails the user's selections, you need to move focus like this:</p><pre>
<code>  ReadINIStr $R0 "$PLUGINSDIR\User Registration.ini" "Field 3" "State"<br>  StrCmp $R0 "" 0 +5<br>  MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_OK "Please enter your name."<br>  ReadINIStr $R0 "$PLUGINSDIR\User Registration.ini" "Field 3" "HWnd"<br>  System::Call "User32::SetFocus(i R0).R0"<br>  Abort<br></code>
</pre>That uses the System plugin, but you don't need to add any includes or anything to call it.<br>
      <br>
      I recommend using the LogicLib header. It adds a lot of readability to your script and you won't need to use the relative jump that is native to the NSIS commands.<br>
      <br>
      The StrCmp jump operand changed in the fragment above because the two lines to set the focus were added after the MessageBox. If you remove the MessageBox the relative jump will have to be changed again from 5 to 4. With the LogicLib you would have an If/EndIf structure instead of relative jumps:
      <pre>
<code>  ReadINIStr $R0 "$PLUGINSDIR\User Registration.ini" "Field 3" "State"<br>  ${If} $R0 == ""<br>    MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_OK "Please enter your name."<br>    ReadINIStr $R0 "$PLUGINSDIR\User Registration.ini" "Field 3" "HWnd"<br>    System::Call "User32::SetFocus(i R0).R0"<br>    Abort<br>  ${EndIf}</code>
</pre><br>
      And since I've already jumped up on the soapbox to say how I like to do things, I like the MUI appearance better than the 'classic'. It isn't always easy to find answers in the documentation, but IMHO the results look better.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for both of your replies. I will try the implementation you describe.<br>
      <br>
      Just one q Don, you mention using the MUI as it looks better - I agree, my code does use it...am I doing something in my code that suggests that i'm not?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not really, but when using MUI we tend to use...<br>
      !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_READ $R0 "User Registration.ini" "Field 3" "State"<br>
      ...instead of...<br>
      ReadINIStr $R0 "$PLUGINSDIR\User Registration.ini" "Field 3" "State"<br>
      <br>
      They both do exactly the same thing, however.<br>
