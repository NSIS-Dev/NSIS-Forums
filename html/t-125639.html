It told that it did that after pressing the "details" button of the uninstaller...(and voil√†, it did)<br><br>That's not very nice of course, because this took me about 15 minutes to re-establish my system.<br><br>No, seriously:<br>If this is build in the uninstaller to look, search and delete these files, this tool should be banned (AND I WILL DO THIS, E.G. POSTS IN PUBLIC FORUMS...)<br>and I would like to verify this, or is the uninstaller spread wide open to infect itself by a virus, and showing this under Uninstall "details".<br><br><br>So is there a way to check this?<br><br>Thx<br>Mo</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th February 2003 12:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Not really. There are now many posts in this forum about decompiling NSIS installers (this applies to uninstallers too).<br><br>NSIS itself won't do what you've reported, those actions will have been performed by NSIS because the script writer asked it to.<br><br>As for a virus, well I've never heard of anything that targets NSIS installers, and to be honest I'd be suprised if NSIS is high profile enough to attract that kind of attention.<br><br>As has been said *many* times before on this forum you cannot decompile an NSIS installer unless you have a tool to do so, and that tool does not exist because it would need to be able to understand the binary generated by many different versions of NSIS (which has changed considerably over time) and also would need to be psychic because it would need to potentially also understand NSIS installers that were built from modified NSIS source (it is open source remember).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th February 2003 13:08 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Where did you download myDevStudio?
