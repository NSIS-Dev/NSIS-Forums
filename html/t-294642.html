When that fires up, Windows puts up a Copying Files dialog to show progress. Since I copy from two folders, I execute CopyFiles twice. Problem is that when the CopyFiles completes (shows 0mb remaining, it doesn't close), it stays there and the NSIS installer progresses to the next screen. This means one has to click around the progress window to get to the NSIS installer and click finish.<br>Its real ugly. I'm seeing this on Vista. Obviously /SILENT prevents the dialog, but I need to show progress, we're talking several gigs of data. Any ideas?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">demiller9</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th July 2008 03:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The thread "<a href="http://forums.winamp.com/search.php?s=&amp;action=showresults&amp;searchid=12996497&amp;sortby=&amp;sortorder=" target="_blank">Vista problem using CopyFiles</a>" discusses the problem you are seeing.
