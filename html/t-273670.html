      <p class="post-content"><strong>nsDialogs</strong><br />
      It's time for something really new. I wrote a plug-in that should replace InstallOptions in the near future. It should be faster, more capable, far more customizable and easier to use. Currently it can create any type of control, call callback functions directory from the script and create dialogs without all the INI files overhead.<br />
      <br />
      It supports specifying units in pixels, dialog units and percentage - both positive and negative. It has a callback for TEXT field changes and for the back button. It's way <i>faster</i>. It has complete control over the style of the generated controls, including extended styles.<br />
      <br />
      When it's done, it'll be even possible to create a real-time InstallOptions to nsDialogs converter that'd simply read the INI file and create the dialog according to it.<br />
      <br />
      At the moment, creating a control requires quite a lot of parameters, but in the future it'll have a library of macros or functions that'd allow easier creation that requires nothing more than a type and location - just like with InstallOptions.<br />
      <br />
      Play with it and let me know if you have any suggestions or issues in mind. Attach cool examples here or useful macros you write and I'll probably include them when nsDialogs goes into CVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">just wanted to say: very cool. I'll be awaiting the usual first few days of "zomg - it just imploded!" before tinkering with it myself, after which our highly customized installer will probably be moving to nsDialogs from InstallOptions. Should save a bunch of code and - more importantly - run faster (takes a second on some of the heavier dialogs on my P1.6M). Might keep the INIs, as currently there's no GUI interface designer for nsDialogs, is there? :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">your question is a bit vague, so I'm not sure what the answer would be. The way I'm reading it right now is that you're using the INI file as a form of variable storage - and depending on the multiple values in the INI file (in the variables), you take a particular action.<br />
      <br />
      Sounds to me like you could...<br />
      A. Stick to using an INI file - except that for each control's callback you'll need to write out the value manually.<br />
      B. For each control's callback, write to a different text file. (Essentially the same as the ini - but more work)<br />
      C. For each control's callback, assign the value to a runtime variable - and instead of reading from an ini / text file, read the runtime variable.<br />
      <br />
      In essence, nsDialogs makes creating the dialogs more flexible, faster (code execution-wise) and independent of ini file storage. Those are the immediate Pros. The immediate cons are that a lot of the automation is gone. I.e. changing a text box's text doesn't automatically store this - you'll have to store this yourself (in a variable of file), through a function that you have to write out, and then associate with the text box's change handler. So on the face of it - it's certainly a good bit more work. I suspect that as you get used to it, though, it'll prove to be a great enhancement.<br />
      <br />
      Eventually some GUI editor for use with nsDialogs will come up and in each control's property sheet there'll just be a "code block to execute when changed" sort of text box, along with a small "code block name", which together simply set up all the Function handling and such for you.<br />
      <br />
      Of course, if it remains something where you think "InstallOptions did just fine for me, and I'm more comfortable with it" - well, InstallOptions doesn't appear to be going away, and the InstallOptionsEx author(s) might have a thing or two to say about the Pros/Cons and decide to continue development there as well :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello,<br />
      <br />
      Is there an automated method of converting a IO ini file to a nsDialogs script? I THOUGHT the io.nsi file in the zip file posted earlier would do it, but that does not seem to be the case.<br />
      <br />
      In any event I have been playing around with NSIS (and HM NIS Edit) for the last couple of days. My installer experience is limited to InstallShield 10.5 and the build-in MSI installer in Visual Studio. I must say I am vastly impressed with NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      I am seriously lacking integration with Source Safe and Visual Studio though, but I guess I can manage without... for now ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can always do that manually, FoBoT. In fact, it's more flexible with nsDialogs as you can enable/disable / change texts on those buttons dynamically based on what the user is doing - with any dialog item rather than only those that would cause an InstallOptions exit.<br />

        </blockquote>AddBrandingImage is unrelated to nsDialogs. It adds an image control to the external dialog and not the internal dialogs, such as those created by nsDialogs. logo.bmp was probably not extracted to $PLUGINSDIR.

        randomSurfer, you can resize the controls and the installer window with Resource Hacker. For mui custom pages it's dialog 105, modern.exe. The changes will be visible in other pages.</p>

        Just wondering if you can re-create the style of the MS installers that show and hide a checkmark image if the CD-KEY entered is valid.<br />
        <br />
        I have the code setup now to show a message box if the key length is valid so I'd just have to change that code to show/hide an image on the page.</p>

        ( Note that as far as controls are concerned SW_SHOW or SW_SHOWNORMAL have the same effect. The only time you get a difference if it's actually a window. Why 'hide' is zero and 'show is -not- one, and why showwindow is what one uses on -controls- in the first place is beyond me. Microsoft, right? )</p>

        </blockquote>That is an excellent idea. In fact, I'm going to modify the registration component to use nsDialog and implement that feature. Thanks for the idea. Kichik, thanks for putting this extension out.

        <p class="post-content">Getting used to the nsDialogs plugin.<br />
        <br />
        Another quick question.<br />
        <br />
        1) I want to show a page with some text.<br />
        2) Show animated .gif<br />
        3) Run function (function handles moving to the next page)<br />
        <br />
        Currently I can't figure out how to do this.<br />
        <br />
        #Start Connecting Page<br />
        Function ConnectingPage<br />
        <br />
        ;Create page<br />
        nsDialogs::Create /NOUNLOAD 1018<br />
        Pop $0<br />
        <br />
        ;(*Update)<br />
        !insertmacro MUI_HEADER_TEXT "Connecting to the Activation Server" "Please wait while we activate $(^NameDA)."<br />
        <br />
        ${NSD_CreateLabel} 0 10 100% 50u "Please wait while we activate $(^NameDA)."<br />
        Pop $0<br />
        <br />
        nsDialogs::Show<br />
        <br />
        Call StartActivation<br />
        <br />
        FunctionEnd<br />
        #End Connecting Page<br />
        <br />
        Using the above code: "StartActivation" is not run until after the NEXT, BACK or CANCEL buttons are clicked.<br />
        <br />
        If I move "Call StartActivation" before "nsDialogs::Show" then the function is run before the text is displayed.<br />
        <br />
        Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
        <br />
        Thanks.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Hi!<br />
        <br />
        Have been spending quite a bit of time rewriting my custom pages to using nsDialogs and must say its a much better way of doing things...<br />
        <br />
        One thing I am having problems with though is the link control.<br />
        For example, I have this:<br />
        <br /></p>
        <pre>
<code><br />${NSD_CreateLink} 29u 125u 96u 10u "http://nsis.sourceforge.net/"<br />Pop $LINKCONTROL<br />${NSD_OnClick} $LINKCONTROL OnLinkClick<br />SetCtlColors $LINKCONTROL ${BLUE} ${WHITE}<br /></code>
</pre><br />
        <br />
        The problem is setting the text colour of the link. For some reason, no text is displayed at all. (Clicking on the link's bounding rectangle works, the OnLinkClick function is called fine.) Any ideas?<br />
        <br />
        Regards,<br />
        Brad.

        <p class="post-content">Thanks kichik, I will give that a go.<br />
        <br />
        I've put together the following macros, I'm pretty new with trying to put these together but they work for me.<br />
        <br /></p>
        <pre>
<code><br />!macro _NSD_ENABLE NAME TOGGLE<br />       SendMessage ${NAME} ${WM_ENABLE} ${TOGGLE} 0 $R0<br />       Push $R0<br />!macroend<br />!define NSD_ENABLE `!insertmacro _NSD_ENABLE`<br /><br />!macro _NSD_CHECKSTATE NAME<br />       SendMessage ${NAME} ${BM_GETCHECK} 0 0 $R0<br />       Push $R0<br />!macroend<br />!define NSD_CHECKSTATE `!insertmacro _NSD_CHECKSTATE`<br /></code>
</pre><br />
        I'm not sure if I need to push $R0 in the macro or pop it after it's called, but it works...<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre>
<code><br />Function CheckboxEvent<br /> ${NSD_CHECKSTATE} $CHECKBOX_ID<br /> Pop $0<br /> <br /> ${NSD_ENABLE} $TEXTBOX_ID $0<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
        <br />
        ${NSD_CHECKSTATE} checks the value of the checkbox and the returned value is used to disable a textbox with ${NSD_ENABLE}.<br />
        <br />
        It might be of some use to somebody.

          <br />
          Label1: [TextBoxForAFilePath1] [BrowseButton1...]<br />
          Label2: [TextBoxForAFilePath2] [BrowseButton2...]<br />

          What is the easiest way to do it?<br />
          <br />
          P.S. and is there a built-in macro that does what the "welcome" example does, where it tries to complete filenames/paths as you type them in? Or would I have to cut-n-paste all the code from that example?</p>

          <p class="post-content">jeffadams78, you must also create a browse button for a file request field. Use ${NSD_CreateBrowseButton}. Underneath it all, FileRequest is actually a Text field and BrowseButton is a actually Button field, so you can also use those if it makes it clearer.<br />
          <br />
          There's no built in macro for SHAutoComplete, you have to call it yourself.<br />
          <br />
          sab0tage, you shouldn't use WM_ENABLE. Use EnableWindow instead. The message is just a notification message and as you can see, doesn't really work for the button.</p>

          will it stay this way or are there more macros in the working? if not, let me point out that "Each of those macros takes 5 parameters" from the docs does not apply to DropList then (to whoever updates the docs)</p>

          <p class="post-content">@Yathosho<br />
          Yes. The notification (OnClick, OnChange and OnNotify) callback functions are exactly for that kind of operations. I made a small example that uses the OnChange callback. It's little light on the comments, but it should give the basic idea.<br />
          <br />
          The example uses EnableWindow to enable / disable conrols, but you can use ShowWindow, SendMessage and system plugin just as well. :)<br />
          <br />
          @ekramulhuq<br />
          CB_* messages are only for ComboBox controls. For ListBox you need to use LB_* messages E.g. LB_ADDSTRING.<br />
          <br />
          See the example. It uses ListBox to do things... :)</p>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>Transparent bitmap</strong><br />
          I have some difficulties to migrate from Installoptions to nsDialog. On the first page I've seen an example how to make transparent controls, but is it possible to do it in a easier way? I need a bitmap control which would make the white background color of the loaded image in it transparent. Is there a color which is handled as transparent by default?<br />
          <br />
          Should ${NSD_AddExStyle} $Image1 ${WS_EX_TRANSPARENT} work?<br />

          <p class="post-content">I have figured out that the way to do it is to change the value of $2 before calling SelectFileDialog.<br />
          <br />
          I tried the following (the Program Files directory is just called Program on my system):<br />
          StrCpy $2 "C:\Program" ; The dialog will begin in C:\ looking for a file called Program<br />
          StrCpy $2 "C:\Program\" ; The dialog will begin in the current working directory<br />
          StrCpy $2 "C:\Program\*" ; The dialog will begin in C:\Program looking for a file called *<br />
          <br />
          How do I make it start in C:\Program but without looking for any particular filename?</p>

          <br />
          I'm trying to disable a ListBox with:<br />
          <br /></p>
          <pre>
<code><br />EnableWindow $ListBox 0<br /></code>
</pre><br />
          <br />
          But this apparently does not work (i.e. it does not get grayed out as opposed to a simple "Text" or "CheckBox").<br />
          <br />
          I searched my code for "Layer 8" faults but couldn't find any what of course doesn't mean that there is none ;)<br />
          <br />
          If it's not supported by nsDialogs: Do I have to make a system call?<br />

            <p class="post-content">Are multistate checkboxes now available with nsDialogs? Or rather something as simple as a checkbox with three states: unchecked, checked, and greyed?<br />
            <br />
            I know for the Sections at least this is possible, but for custom dialog pages with nsDialogs I don't see anything pre-setup like the other nsDialog macros yet. I did note a few definitions for things like BS_3STATE and BS_AUTO3STATE, if those may have anything to do with it. However I'm not too well aware of the basics of the Styles and ExStyles sent to nsDialogs::CreateControl. Is there anything from msdn/etc I could read to figure out what to do to get this done? Or would it just be a monumental feat of work to make a 3-state checkbox?<br />
            <br />
            Also I think this has been asked many times in NSIS past before, sorry if the answer is already there somewhere. Whether you call them 3-state or multi-state or intermediate states...not sure of the proper term.</p>

            <p class="post-content"><strong>Right aligned link control with nsDialogs ?</strong><br />
            Hi folks,<br />
            <br />
            I am trying to create a link control that is right aligned and so far I haven't been able to. Is this possible?<br />
            <br />
            I've tried this:<br />
            <br /></p>
            <pre>
<code><br />${NSD_CreateLink} 0 176 100% 12u "Some Link"<br />Pop $MyLabel                 <br />${NSD_AddStyle} $MyLabel ${SS_RIGHT}<br />${NSD_AddExStyle} $MyLabel ${WS_EX_RIGHT} <br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            But to no avail. I understand that if the link is an ownerdrawn custom control (not a static) then it should not accept SS_RIGHT, but even WS_EX_RIGHT does nothing.<br />
            <br />
            Am I out of luck ?<br />
            Thanks!<br />

            <p class="post-content">alright, well underway to getting everything over to nsDialogs - doing a complete rewrite as I go as there's just too much that was relying on InstallOptions(Ex).<br />
            <br />
            Here's two quick questions...<br />
            1. when might an 'error' occur when creating a dialog?<br />
            The examples all trap for the 'error' response out of 'nsDialogs::Create' and then call Abort (page gets skipped) - but I'm not seeing anything in the documentation as to what might cause an 'error' response to begin with.<br />
            <br />
            2. I had a peek about and I think there was a thread where it was suggest to file a feature request for an onMouseover callback - has one been logged? If not, where might I log one?<br />
            ( this would be nice to combine with the SetCursor plugin so that I can make it visually obvious when, for example, a bitmap control is clickable; might use the ToolTips plugin as an alternative of sorts? )</p>

            <p class="post-content">I want to create a custom page with a scrollable status message box, similar to the status (details) control in the standard installation page. Is this something that nsDialogs could do, or am I going against a wall? If nsdialogs could do it, would someone sketch it out for me, please? If it couldn't, would someone give me some alternative ideas based on other plugins?<br />
            I have looked at the nsis source code to see how the installation page does its thing, I see it's based on a listview control, but the code is way over my head...<br />
            <br />
            The crucial point is that I should append text to the control synchronously, in a way to the text looks like a growing log and the user can scroll back.<br />
            ---<br />
            If nsdialogs could handle controls on the installation page I would use the standard details control, but I read that nsdialogs controls don't work on standard pages, although that was one of the initial design considerations.</p>

            <p class="post-content">whats wrong with a listbox? You need some code to set the width of the longest line (But it has already been done, I posted the code on the forum a while back) I also does not have the tooltip like the instfiles page has. It would also be possible to use a listview if thats what you really want, but it will require a bit of system plugin use to handle the LV_ITEM struct</p>

            </blockquote>Thanks. So I tried the Listbox and it seems good enough. What I'm missing is some way to export the text (like copy to clipboard in instfiles) and horizontal scrolling, which I don't think is possible, and that's maybe why instfiles does have the tooltip. I don't know the maximum length of a line in advance, why did you hint at setting the maximum line width?

            <br />
            You could probably pull off the tooltip using my subclass plugin, but if you want a tooltip that bad, you are better off going with a listview and not the simpler listbox<br />
            <br />
            When it comes to export, just having a button that does it is the easy way (I'm sure the wiki or forum has existing clipboard code sample) If you really really want ctrl+c or a context menu, you would have to subclass (My subclass plugin is very much in the alpha stage and you need to know win32 programming to use it)</p>

            I need to find out how to Vscroll programmatically. I googled and found a hint about setting the top index with a message, but I haven't fleshed it out yet. Now I'm off to do the Hscroll bar. As regards exporting, I think I will do a simple button.</p>

            <p class="post-content">My installer has a single custom page built with nsDialogs.<br />
            Sometimes it doesn't repaint custom page areas that were temporarily covered by another window. What techniques are available to work around this kind of repainting issues?<br />
            <br />
            Specifically, when my installer shows a MessageBox over the custom page title area, when I OK the MessageBox parts of the title area may not be repainted. It also happens with the progress bar control which is placed right below the title area.<br />
            <br />
            Andi it may also happen when I replace the MessageBox with a directory or file browse dialog, after OKing the dialog.</p>

            Creating them is relatively simple, in fact. Adding e.g. treeview items, getting them, etc. are far more involved (requiring the System plugin). So if you can take care of that, surely a !include can't hurt? :)</p>

            <p class="post-content">If you mean I can take sources, modify them and compile - that's Great! But you see, i don't have VC compiler :( , and i'm dial-up user :-P . So I want you, Animaether, or anybody else to add the necessary lines and compile the plugin. Can anyone here handle it? I'll appreciate that a lot.<br />
            <br />
            - Edit -<br />
            Oh, I see plugin can create what I want (AFAIK, early versions didn't support this trick) ! So the thing is how to manage it? If the NSdialogs.nsh lacks of it, them I'm gonna make it possible :) ! Thanks for replies.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Yay for the edit ;)<br />
            <br />
            Not sure how long it's supported this, but it's been there for some time. Have a peek at, for example:<br />
            <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialogs_CreateTextMultiline" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialog...eTextMultiline</a><br />
            <br />
            That's a pretty basic extension of nsDialogs that uses the very same code conventions that all the other nsDialogs controls use in terms of naming, styles, etc. Makes it easier for users/developers to integrate it with their nsDialogs.nsh (although it can be kept separate from it.. it will still depend on nsDialogs.nsh, of course).<br />
            <br />
            In your case, you'd just need to define SysListView32 as the class name and then ponder what styles you might need. You may need to define several classes if some of the styles you're interested in cannot be set after the control has been created; hence why CreateTextMultiline exists - you can't set the multiline style on an Edit control after it has been created.<br />
            <br />
            But, like I said, that's the easy part :) Good luck!</p>

            <p class="post-content">Yep, I know about that too :) . Another "weird" thing comes to mind: it would be easier to make a plugin which will handle all the operations with getting and setting text into the controls instead of writing .nsh ...Err...I'll give it (.nsh writing) a try anyway ;) .</p>

              <i>Originally posted by Nicholi</i><br />
              <b>Are multistate checkboxes now available with nsDialogs? Or rather something as simple as a checkbox with three states: unchecked, checked, and greyed?</b>
            </blockquote>Looks like that's one of those styles that you have to set upon creation (can't use NSD_AddStyle / SetWindowLong trickery; which should get abstracted to an NSD_SetStyle, but anyway), so you would have to use something like:<br />
            <br />
            <pre>
<code><br />nsDialogs::CreateControl "Button" ${DEFAULT_STYLES}|${WS_TABSTOP}|${BS_TEXT}|${BS_MULTILINE}|${BS_VCENTER}|${BS_AUTO3STATE} 0 0 0 100% 8% "Checkbox"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            Most of that is copied from the existing checkbox code in nsDialogs.nsh, except that BS_AUTOCHECKBOX was replaced with BS_AUTO3STATE.<br />
            <br />
            Actually, perusing MSDN some more, it looks like you can set the button style on-the-fly using the BM_SETSTYLE message;<br />
            <pre>
<code><br />        ${NSD_CreateCheckbox} 0 0 100% 8% "Checkbox"<br />            Pop $0<br />            StrCpy $1 0<br />            IntOp $1 $1 | ${DEFAULT_STYLES}<br />            IntOp $1 $1 | ${BS_TEXT}<br />            IntOp $1 $1 | ${BS_MULTILINE}<br />            IntOp $1 $1 | ${BS_VCENTER}<br />            IntOp $1 $1 | ${BS_AUTO3STATE}<br />            SendMessage $0 ${BM_SETSTYLE} $1 1<br /></code>
</pre><br />
            <br />
            Pretty sure you don't need most of those styles (most are implied, others don't apply to a checkbox-style 'button') and you can just use:<br />
            <pre>
<code>SendMessage $0 ${BM_SETSTYLE} ${BS_AUTO3STATE} 1</code>
</pre>

              <p class="post-content">I suppose negative positions are not supported? ( control doesn't appear to get created at all).<br />
              <br />
              I've got a label that I need to actually have higher up than 0%; the reason for this is that the font used is pretty tall, but the character I need is low - to align it properly, I have to move the very top of that label to a negative Y position (won't hurt as all the label space above that character is blank).<br />
              <br />
              I'll work around it with GetWindowRect and SetWindowPos (naming consistency? pft) probably as I just need to nudge this thing up, but if I'm not missing something, then this might be a good wishlist item:<br />
              - allow negative X and Y positions<br />
              - allow negative width/height (calculating from the canvas's width/height and subtracting the value from that, so that e.g. moving a control to the left doesn't require you to adjust the width to end up at the same alignment on the right)</p>

              <p class="post-content">Hi 2 all once again. I decided to somehow modify nsDialogs original code situated over <a href="http://nsis.sourcearchive.com/documentation/2.44-4/nsDialogs_8c-source.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

</pre>So can somebody say what's wrong?<br />
              <br />
              P.S.: I needed to add the ability to create "custom parented" controls, so that not only "g_dialog.hwDialog" could be the parent window when creating a control with CreateWindowEx function.<br />
              And if anybody can recompile the DLL for me I'll appreciate that greatly =) (I added one more "popint" to the code to get the necessary parent control).

              I didn't get any responses to this when posting on the main board. Maybe better luck here:<br />
              <br />
              I've got a simple callback function when a button is clicked to remove the selected item from a listbox. It works correctly only if the topmost item is selected. Otherwise, it seems like the item directly above the actual selection gets removed from the LB. Here's the callback:<br />

              Seems like nsDialogs bug. NSD_LB_DelString macro send the LB_DELETESTRING message with lParam set as the string of the item to delete, but according to MSDN lParam is not used by LB_DELETESTRING.<br />
              <br />
              Instead NSD_LB_DelString macro should send the LB_DELETESTRING message with wParam set as the index of the item to delete.<br />
              <br />
              Try using this code:</p>
              <pre>
<code>Function Callback_RemoveSite<br />LogEx::Write " RemoveSite button clicked. Inside callback function."<br />SendMessage $Listbox_SiteNameID ${LB_GETCURSEL} 0 0 $0<br />SendMessage $Listbox_SiteNameID ${LB_DELETESTRING} $0 0<br />FunctionEnd</code>

              <p class="post-content">Just a minor bug report here as well (nsDialogs isn't listed in the bug tracker, unless I missed it)...<br />
              <br />
              When using ${NSD_SetImage}, the image filename parameter cannot be stored in $R0 - this gets overwritten by nsDialogs and essentially just blanks the bitmap control you're trying to set an image to.<br />
              <br />
              Work-around is to not use $R0.<br />
              <br />
              Fix is to adjust nsDialogs.nsh:<br />

                I can do all the treeview defines but I dont know the windows api to add items ect.
              </blockquote>The win32 treeview does not have the same kind of header support like listview has, while it is possible (A header can exist as its own HWND inside any kind of parent control), you would need to write your own custom plugin...
