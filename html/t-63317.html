      i need help with my nsis gui, slate blue. it is becoming way too much work for me to finish by myself, within a reasonable timeframe. below is a list of things that i can use help on:<br />
      <br />
      using vc++ to allow the NSIS DLL written by pjw (i believe) to send the status text to my program, or to write it to a .txt file so i can load it into my program. also allow my program to compile nsis scripts quickly and easily with the dll. (slate blue is written in vb).<br />
      then there's just help with the program; a better way to parse scripts, layout ideas, etc.<br />
      <br />
      let me know,</p>

      <p class="post-content">I could modify the dll so that it simply logs to the handle of a supplied edit window, rather than having the callback function.<br />
      <br />
      Included in the newest dll downloadable is a function<br />
      'int Process_Script_Param(char *filename, char *defines, BOOL SetDir, BOOL do_config, LPARAM lParam);<br />
      <br />
      if you give lParam the valid handle of an edit window, the output will be logged to there.. (ala makenwin as included in the download).</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was trying to go to COMDEX this year to learn C-bang (C# - microsoft's new programming language). But it is only $800.00!!!! But I may not go. UNLESS, they had an educational discount :P<br />
      <br />
      But no matter what, I would be glad to help. <a href="mailto:duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net">duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net</a> is my e-mail address. e-mail me with what I could do.<br />

      <p class="post-content">That's C-sharp, not C-bang :) C-bang would be "C!"<br />
      <br />
      And I would stay away from it if I were you. It's basically Java, but without the cross-platform compatibility. Microsoft got its official Java license revoked so they put out their own similar language instead.<br />

      Don't buy into their sinister schemes to corrupt the free programmers of the world!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know quite a bit about parsing Text files (my editor TibEd).<br />
      So perhaps I could write a new parser... not sure if it's needed, because I haven't looked at any code, but it's possible.<br />
      I don't have a lot of time at the moment though - in 2 weeks I'll know if I have the time to do it.</p>
