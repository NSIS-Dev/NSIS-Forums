It worked perfectly on my machine (Vista Business edition) but when it was tested on other machines, it fails on Home and Ultimate editions (but works on other Business edition machines). The reported error is that games.dll in a temp directory can not be loaded. The dll is there and I can't see anything wrong with it. For a while I thought maybe it had to be signed, but that doesn't change anything. Is it remotely possible that it's because it's built on Vista Business (I put some debugging code in and rebuilt)? Or what other possible reason could there be for this?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd December 2007 21:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">That plug-in depends on MSVCR80.dll.
