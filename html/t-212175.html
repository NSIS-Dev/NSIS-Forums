Since MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_DESCRIPTION_INFO is used in the macro MUI_LANGUAGE, I'd say your script is probably calling this more than once (or you simply have the MUI_LANGUAGE macro in the wrong place.)<br><br>!define or !include statements are explained in the help manual. As for the MUI, take the time to look at the readme document installed along with NSIS (${NSISDIR/Contrib/Modern UI/Readme.html).
