      <p class="post-content"><strong>Inetc 302 Redirect failure with Inetc::get</strong><br />
      I am redirecting, at my server, a inetc::get request from my install app. On server 2003 as localhost and XPPro SP2 using the LAN IP for the server it works fine - the file is downloaded and is properly installed..<br />
      When I try it on w2k sp4 using the LAN IP for the server, the request fails with the message returned to inetc::get - 302 Redirection.<br />
      And there it stops.<br />
      Can anyone advise me on special considerations when using redirect with intec::get?<br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Inetc does nothing for redirection, if possible WinInet.dll does this. Or returns 3xx status. Probably WinInet is different on comps where yor tested redirection. This may be OS or IE dependant difference.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the quick response, Takhir.<br />
      <br />
      I checked wininet versions: server version is '08 while W2k version is '04.<br />
      I copied the server wininet.dll version to the install dir on the 2K machine. According to LoadLibrary specs, with only filename given in call, first look is in current dir.<br />
      Unfortunately, this did not work.<br />
      Is my assumption correct about this?<br />
      <br />
      The old (orig.) wininet.dll on 2K machine works fine on redirects if i paste an URL into IE 6 or FF 3.52 or dbl clk it from Outlook mail msg.Any other ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Possible Computer/Network Issue</strong><br />
      I was not able to get any change in redirect behavior after putting wininet.dll from working machine in exec. path/cur dir of install app on "bad" machine.<br />
      I have since got the redirects in the installer working on another old W2k sp4 machine - with the identical wininet.ddl located in sys32.<br />
      <br />
      Conclusion: 2 days wasted on chimera.<br />
      So I declare this "not a problem" with inetc.<br />
      Takhir, thanks for the assistance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Glad to help if I could but 3.5 years later, after all the stuff I've done since, I cannot recall.<br />
      As you know, my last msg stated NOT inetc:GET problem since I got it working on another W2k box.<br />
      Good luck.</p>
