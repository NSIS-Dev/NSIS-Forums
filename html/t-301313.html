However, when I need to do anything other than a very basic installer I have very little idea what I need to do.<br><br>For example, I am presently struggling to create 7 different custom UI's. I thought I would simply use the NSH script from the Modern UI as a reference point and teach myself by trial and error.<br><br>Unfortunately, this idea hit a snag because my custom UI won't even compile for me to be able to see what I have done wrong.<br><br>My thought is that if someone can help me to create the first one, that will then give me a working reference for all the others (as well as any future ones).<br><br>I will completely understand if no-one has the time, patience, or inclination to teach an old man but I figured I had nothing to lose by asking.<br><br>Any assistance will, of course, be appreciated more than mere words can express.<br><br><br>*EDITED TO BETTER REFLECT GOOD MANNERS :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Anders</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd December 2008 14:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">when you say custom UI's, do you mean custom pages (like welcome,startmenu,finish etc) or change the built-in pages (license,components,directory)?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Kaos61</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd December 2008 14:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Sorry ... by "custom UI's" I basically mean just changing the graphics and icons on the standard installer.<br><br>I do a lot of voluntary work from home, and some of the welfare agencies I help out have asked if I can put their logo and web address etc on each page of the installer.<br><br>I have already done all the graphic work.
