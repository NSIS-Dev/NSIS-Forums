If it fails to compile and you are not willing to fix it, you can go back to NSIS v2.28 at any time. Nevertheless I personally wouldn't release software based on an "outdated" NSIS version, because your installer will contain bugs that have already been fixed...</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dandaman32</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th June 2008 06:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">NSIS compatibility has been nearly perfect since 2.0. Stuff like SubSection was renamed to SectionGroup but still compiles (albeit with a warning) if you use SubSection.

That is exactly what I just did. It seems to have gone OK.<br><br>One observation, though:<br><br>When installing v2.37, I chose the "uninstall existing version" first (I like to work "clean", without the confusion of having two different versions of the same program installed side by side). It deleted the Plugins and Include subdirectories (that's good), <b>including the ones that I placed there manually</b> (that's surprising).<br><br>I fixed that pretty quickly, but it would be nice if things that were added manually (i.e. not by the installation program) to the C:\Program Files\NSIS directory tree, had not been deleted automatically.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sheik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th June 2008 16:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yeah, it deleting ALL my plugins, even ones it didn't place in there, is really bad.<br><br>I suspect it all comes back to the fact that NSIS doesn't keep track/know about "its files" during Uninstall.<br><br>Its ironic in a way, there are HUGE warnings about not doing an RMDIR /r, and then the Uninstaller for NSIS goes and does it!<br><br>&gt; RMDir /r $INSTDIR\Plugins<br><br>In fact, it also "whacks" all of include and contrib too:<br>&gt; RMDir /r $INSTDIR\Contrib<br>&gt; RMDir /r $INSTDIR\Include<br><br>Which is REALLY bad, as we might actually have 3rd party NSIS stuff, that installs into Plugin/Contrib/Include, and oops, they are all gone!<br><br>Personally, I still feel this is one of the biggest deficiencies of all of NSIS...<br>ie, the lack of any install logging by DEFAULT in NSIS, for later use during Uninstall.<br><br>I know there are plugins/hacks/etc that allow us to be smarter about uninstalling, but why should they be plugins/extras?<br><br>To me, this problem is so fundamental/critical, that the installer/uninstaller should have the install logging builtin from Day 1.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Anders</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th June 2008 16:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">the official word is (IIRC), nsis\plugins is for nsis only, use !addpluginsdir for 3rd party stuff, also you could just install over the top of the old install without uninstalling first.
