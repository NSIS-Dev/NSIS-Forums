      Howdy.<br />
      <br />
      I've been working on an installer that extracts a handful of files to a client computer, but I also would like to add a bookmark to Firefox or Chrome at the end of the installation.<br />
      <br />
      I've spent the past few days searching, and while I've figured out my other issues, this one has proved difficult.<br />
      <br />
      I looked at it from the direction of NSIS, but did not see anything, but I also looked at Firefox and Chrome to see if there's a way to add a bookmark via command line, to see if I could do something that way and hopefully just need to adapt it to work with NSIS. However, I have not found any documentation that would let me answer that question.<br />
      <br />
      I've figured that Firefox uses SQLite, and Chrome uses what I guess is a JSON blob of sorts to store bookmarks in, but is there some sort of way to add a single bookmark to them?<br />
      <br />
      Things that may be relevant when discussing: I'm using HM NIS Edit on Windows 8, and for my installer, I am using MUI.nsh, as this is what HM NIS Edit offers.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't really think browser vendors want you to add bookmarks (the user should be in full control). I think a lot of people will see that as evil spyware like behavior.<br />
      <br />
      Even with that in mind I'm guessing their storage choice is more about already having a parser for those formats already so that is why they are stored that way.<br />
      <br />
      You could try to find a command line tool to deal with sqlite and maybe try the nsis json plugin.</p>

      Yes, I figured that was likely the case for this. I've mostly abandoned the idea, and opted to just put a link to our support page in the start menu along with the program being installed, as well as one in Internet Explorer's Favorites folder.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for the insight.</p>
