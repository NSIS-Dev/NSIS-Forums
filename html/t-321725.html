      <p class="post-content"><strong>Unwanted Hourglass after Exec</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      <br />
      Here is what I am trying to do. After a certain page in the installer I need to run an EXE, which is a process that takes a long time to complete and that I want to run in parallel with the installer (i.e. this process will continue to work long after the Install is finished).<br />
      <br />
      I used the Exec command to start the process knowing that it will not get the installer stuck waiting for the process to complete. In that regard it works fine, the next page shows up and the user can click on it and continue with the install process.<br />
      <br />
      The problem though is that the next page cursor becomes an hourglass (or on my Vista machine a cursor with the round circle animation next to it). The cursor stays like this for a few seconds (maybe like 7 seconds or so) and then becomes normal. Although functionality is not affected this is very annoying and confusing to the user.<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Does it become a full hourglass, or only a small hourglass next to the normal pointer? If it's the latter, it means that there is an application running in the background, so that is as designed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It is the latter, I understand it is technically correct but from user experience point of view it is confusing, the user does not understand a new process started etc, and I'd rather get rid of it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tried to change it to OCR_NORMAL - it has no effect, looks the same. Just to make sure the change cursor code works I tried to change it to OCR_CROSS and it did work.</p>
