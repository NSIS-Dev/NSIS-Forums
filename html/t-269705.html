      <p class="post-content"><strong>user only vs. admin vs. everyone install</strong><br />
      My thinking on this is to use the userinfo plugin and then do an if then on every section... is this the right approach? I'm not even sure you can include a section in a conditional. Anyhow, any help would be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">other options i have considered are using the installoptions pages or somehow using accesscontrol, but the latter seems kind of unclear to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">just wondering if anyone had any feedback on using accesscontrol to do a user vs everyone install.<br />
      <br />
      Should I get the account type with userinfo then somehow use accesscontrol to install? I'm just sort of unclear as to how to use accesscontrol.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The AccessControl only modifies access to certain files or registry keys. What you want is to check if the user is an administrator and install to the proper locations in that case. If the user is just a plain old user, don't write into HKLM and don't install into $PROGRAMFILES.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Somewhere where the user can write files, like his My Documents folder. It's one of the less ideal places, but you can be sure it's writable.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello all together!<br />
      I don`t have the same Problem but its close to yours.<br />
      I have to program a Installer where a few Files hafe to extract, and after that step some of them should be started by the Installer.<br />
      Till here it works. But one of the them must be started from a nother user with admin rights. But i don`t know how!<br />
      There must be a parameter which instructs the installer to run the specific .exe as User p3.vpn and with Pass. XXXX e.g.<br />
      Till today my command looks like this:<br />
      ExecWait '"C:\KillProcess.exe" probeService current|p3.vpn'<br />
      but this does not work.<br />
      Do you have any ideas?</p>
