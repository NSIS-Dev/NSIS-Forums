      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to determine the type of the file if the file has no extension ?</strong><br />
      As with NSIS, determine the type of file if the file has <b>no extension</b> ?<br />
      (these files are often formed when downloading is often found not in the correct extension for video and image files)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would not trust that kind of detection, for example; mp3 files might start with a ID3 or LAME tag or no header at all and you would have to look for mp3 frames/sync. Both Wav and AVI files are in a RIFF container and you need to parse that first, not just use a fixed offset...</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's a simple approach and not 100% foolproof, I agree. But I tested against dozens of files and I think it's reliable enough for most practical purposes. I guess you didn't notice that in mp3 case several variations are checked for, including ID3 (LAME tag is never in the first 16B afaik, I tested Lame-encoded files w/wo ID3). In case of wav/avi, I initially considered checking for RIFF first but it would've been redundant as they in fact can be identified without exception by reading from a fixed offset (8; WAVEfmt/AVI LIST).</p>
