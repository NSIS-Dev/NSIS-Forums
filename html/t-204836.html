Have a look at my Self-Extractor header file. Every setting is set via an !insertmacro (which are hidden in-turn by more !defines).<br><br>The problem with the text.htm page not being displayed inside your ISUI Readme.html page (on IE), is because you've set a classid that defines a page 'Print' button, whereas you want to display an HTML document!

One bug that I noticed is that I had a setup.nsi for Notepad, but it got overwritten when I extracted the setup.nsi file for the main ISUI setup program. This bug was fixed by renaming the ISUI installer setup.nsi to ISUISetup.nsi. The Notepad setup is now setup.nsi.<br><br>Second, the temp files bug was fixed by a macro (ISUI_TEMPFILES_DELETE) in version 1.01. This is about to be sent to Afrow UK. Sorry about this...I've had some bad experiences with the $PLUGINSDIR variable, and I just had to use $TEMP instead.<br><br>Third, the flashes. This is unavoidable, but nearly nonexistent with fast machines. This is because NSIS resets all of the control colors for the pages when you click Next or Back.<br><br>Fourth, the mystery window. (for lobo lunar) The ISUI 1.0 setup program has to minimize all open programs, and your window had the #32770 class (probably) and the setup tried to "minimize" it. This bug is fixed in 1.01 by using a customized "show desktop.scf" file.<br><br>Last, the name and UI. First, I did (sorry) start with the Modern UI and added lots more features, but in respect for the NSIS license I did give credit where credit is due ("If you use this software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be appreciated but is not required.")<br><br>Thanks for hosting afrow uk, and thanks once again to all who gave bug reports! Your input is greatly appreciated!<br><br>I dont know how attatchments work yet because i'm new to the winamp forums. obviously the screenshot app didn't go through. sorry.<br><br>The new version's setup is known to crash sometimes, but this is because of the MSIBanner plugin (sorry, lobo lunar). This has been proven by creating a test program without the ISUI implementation. If you get problems, try again or restart your pc and this should go away. If it doesn't, run setup with the /SafeMode cmd line switch to disable optional plugins.<br><br>Any other comments are welcome on this post and and at my email (see above)<br><br>-dandaman32</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dandaman32</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th January 2005 17:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">p. s. i also dropped the nsis superpacker</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th January 2005 19:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I am aware that you put notepad in for editing scripts, but the fact that you included the exe would be illegal...<br>Also being that you have included the Windows XP version of notepad means that it probably won't run properly on Win9x anyway!<br>Just make a shortcut to notepad.exe instead:<br>CreateShortCut "$SYSTEM\notepad.exe"<br><br>And you'd better create your own UI design.

I can legally change one of the color channels by one digit and add a single pixel to the images (I've already customized them a bit) and be out of MacroVision's way.

        The readme bug there is actually normal. By using that frame system, I am (a) making a fashion statement and (b) I think it looks cool because it doesn't crowd up the page with scrollbars.<br>
        <br>
        Depending on how many people like this arrangement I may or may not take out the activex control. I still think it looks cool... :p<br>

        <br>
        PS here's a readme update (adds a "tips" section). Once again only for firefox. This update requires XPUI version 1.02 with the patching system, so if you don't have it, get it. This is how I intend to distribute all patches from now on except, of course, for the occasional complete system release.</p>

        I think you've got a Firefox plugin installed that I don't have. Obviously if that is the case then you should really use an iframe. User's shouldn't have to download plugins to read a readme, or download and install Firefox if they're using IE or K-Meleon!<br>

        <p class="post-content">dandaman32, looking at your screeshot and the one from Afrow, both appear to be the same. But, after looking closer, I can see that the font type (and possibly the size) are different. The window sizes also appear to be different. So if I were to guess, I'd say that is likely where the problem is.<br>
        <br>
        (As a side note, I have to say that I think the boring "TEXT.HTM" file is much easier to read than the README file. And, when you think about, the main purpose of the readme doc is to find out how to use the interface--it's not supposed to look pretty!)</p>

        <p class="post-content">Thanks for the example afrow uk!<br>
        I'm e-mailing you with the latest version (1.03) soon (not on my own computer now) New version has bugfixes like: no longer kills internet explorer, uses HTA for the readme, and (hooray!) the readme is <i>finally</i> Internet Explorer compatible. The readme uses a full-screen HTA with an iframe and a handy "close window" button. Also, the setup uses HTA for the midi file, so no more stupid security warnings.<br>
        <br>
        The NotifyIcon and Minimize bugs have been fixed, too.<br>
        <br>
        The new defines are XPUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC and XPUI_DISABLEBG. What I don't explain in the readme is that some skins include a background that takes up tons of space in the installer and you can disable this to free up space.<br>
        <br>
        The readme fonts have been fixed. My readme screenshot was from the newer beta versions of the XPUI and it now uses standard fonts (tahoma, verdana, etc) I also use cleartype, so the fonts look slightly different.<br>

        <p class="post-content"><strong>ExperienceUI with the Multi-language support</strong><br>
        Good afternoon,<br>
        <br>
        First of all, congratulation for excellent work provides.<br>
        <br>
        I have succeeds to modify ExperienceUI to add the<br>
        multi-language support to it, for the moment, only English and<br>
        French langage are available.<br>
        <br>
        I am not finish it yet.<br>
        <br>
        In the passing, I also have create new a skin named InstallSheild. it looks like it even more. For that, I thus created new InstallSheildUI.exe<br>
        See the attach file!<br>
        <br>
        I also is profited from it for corrected some bugs being in the files Setup.nsi and XPUI.nsh<br>
        <br>
        To activate this support, it is enough to add in scripts:<br>
        <br>
        !insertmacro XPUI_LANGUAGE "French"<br>
        !insertmacro XPUI_LANGUAGE "English"<br>
        !insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_LANGDLL<br>
        <br>
        Function .onInit<br>
        !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br>
        FunctionEnd<br>
        <br>
        Function un.onInit<br>
        !insertmacro MUI_UNGETLANGUAGE<br>
        FunctionEnd<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I would post on in this same subject, the files modified when I finish.<br>
        <br>
        I also think to make a fork of it so that I can make several modifications such as the support of the start menu page, an update page, an abord page...</p>

        <p class="post-content">dandaman32 dropped the idea of calling it an InstallShield UI, because that would be breaking copyright. You should also do the same... I'd call it something different.<br>
        Also I don't think dandaman32 has finished with his coding yet, so perhaps it would be wise if you made a joint effort and worked together. Otherwise we'll have two versions of ExUI around the place.<br>
        <br>
        Edit: Never mind, you've called it InstallSheild not InstallShield so it doesn't matter :D<br>

        But it is true that I would like to make my own version because I find, the dandaman32 version, too complicated, by example its XPUISetup.nsi script is not recompilable, there are macros that miss.</p>

        <p class="post-content">hey guys,<br>
        <br>
        superpat, I'm glad you're writing a multi-language platform for the xpui. I don't have a problem with you posting your modified script as an XPUI patch file (see readme) but the InstallShield skin may make the folks at macrovision jump. I suggest you post your skin as a skin file, and call it something like 'metallic'. I will try and package it up for you if thats ok.<br>
        <br>
        A good skin developers' tip is to use instead of<br>
        *!define [symbol] [value]* use<br>
        *!insertmacro XPUI_DEFAULT [symbol] [value]*.<br>
        This allows the installer developer to customize the skin. The example skins will have this implementation in the next release. Superpat, I can see that you used this technique, so good for you<br>
        <br>
        Now that we have a basic multi-language system, I am accepting language files at dandaman32 &lt;at&gt; users &lt;dot&gt; sourceforge &lt;dot&gt; net or on this post.<br>
        <br>
        Also, in order to keep the script done in my coding style and to keep it organized in my way, I am only going to accept help with multi-language support and language files. :cry:<br>
        <br>
        Coming in next release:<br>
        A new set of "page mode" macros that will allow you to use any installer page in an uninstaller. Here's what I want it to be like:<br>
        <br>
        ; XPUI_PAGEMODE_INST is inserted automatically at<br>
        ; the end of XPUI.nsh<br>
        !include XPUI.nsh<br>
        !insertmacro XPUI_PAGE_WELCOME<br>
        !insertmacro XPUI_PAGE_INSTFILES<br>
        <br>
        ; now all pages will be used in the uninstaller<br>
        !insertmacro XPUI_PAGEMODE_UNINST<br>
        !insertmacro XPUI_PAGE_WELCOME<br>
        !insertmacro XPUI_PAGE_INSTFILES<br>

        <br>
        This file allows you to upgrade to XPUI version 1.04 via a patch file. It does not update the uninstaller, so you will need to manually delete files during the uninstall.<br>
        <br>
        I am also sending the full version to afrow uk.<br>

        <p class="post-content">I don't think this is right. I just downloaded the file, and the main script does not have the 1.04 version number or the new ASCII art. Perhaps you got the wrong file, afrow uk? I thought I zipped the right file up, but I moved my workspace folder recently and maybe you got the version from the old folder. But, I need Windows 2k to read my keychain drive, which has the latest version.<br>
        <br>
        I am on a remote machine right now, and I just realized that 1) I should make my keychain disk not NTFS (the computer I'm using is Win98), or 2) that I should adapt the install script so that I can edit the XPUI while I'm on the road without my keychain disk. I will try and post this file soon.<br>

        </blockquote>i've been working on it a little bit between other projects. the main stumbling block remaining has been the combobox and getting that to skin correctly (since that's a normally used control in an installer).<br>
        <br>
        my plans are to get at least a test build out by the end of next week (as well as my winamp plugin which is using the same core once all the changes are merged together)<br>

        I'm glad to hear that a plugin is being made, and if possible I would like to see a recent build, even if comboboxes don't work. After all, the only place NSIS uses a combobox is on the components page.<br>

        Here's an example.<br>
        Use at your own risk, as this is not a patch or official release, and there is no documentation.<br>
        <br>
        The Abort Page works the same as the welcome page, ex:<br>
        XPUI_WELCOMEPAGE_TEXT becomes<br>
        XPUI_ABORTPAGE_TEXT for the abort page<br>

          The next release is almost done. I have written a Finish page with reboot, run, and docs support, and the XPUI.nsh file will now be split into several different components. This will allow easier modification to the system, and it makes the whole thing more organized. This will also allow you to add your own macros, etc to the XPUI using the Components\Contrib folder. An example of both features can be found in the attached file.<br>

          <br>
          I like your UI, but it has some problems:<br>
          - The installer window can't center automatically on my screen (800x600). When I drag it to another position and I click on one of the buttons on the bottom right corner, it seems that the window comes back to the original position.<br>
          - After the first time the background image is drawn (outside the installer window), and after the above problem happens, the background image is not redrawn right and the old window's image is still there, until I redraw manually moving the installer window over it.<br>
          - More redrawing problems: when I drag the installer window outside the screen and put back, the text from static controls (labels) disappear.<br>
          - Is the tray icon supposed to disappear after the installer is loaded? It doesn't appear to be loading. Also, maybe because of this I can't left-click the Windows start button.<br>
          - I think you could use nsExec to run the temporary bat script.<br>
          <br>
          I need to restart my computer to see if all of these are true, which I can't right now.<br>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>Still something...</strong><br>
          WIndows XP introduced a feature for programmers that used the Notification Tray icon API that allows one to hide and show the icon. Previously people deleted the icon and readded it when "showing" and "hiding" which meant the icon would appear at a different place next time it was "shown". And you can also check for the validity of the icon under WinXP. In WInXp such icons also has a GUID where you assign a unique ID (generated by yourself). The GUID feature is mostly used by the "hide unused icons" feature.<br>

The greatest headache is when a program you installed can't be uninstalled because there is a problem with the installation, and so you would need to uninstall it by hand.<br>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>More 2 cents or maybe a quarter.</strong><br>
          And what is the point in making such a huge "hack" (excuse me for calling it that) for NSIS, when most if not all is based on slowly executing code (NSIS compiled code is custom bytecode parsed by a run-time bytecode executer routine). Not that NSIS code is slow all the time but when used in a way such as in ExperienceUI it <b>will</b> be slow.<br>
          <br>
          This just bloats the installer even more. If you want InstallShield then use InstallShield. Don't settle for the next best (excuse me Mr. NSIS but I say this to state my point).<br>
          <br>
          I ofcourse love NSIS and even though InnoSetup comes with source (I downloaded that too of course) I only use NSIS because of it's powerful scripting language and the way you can exploit it to make small applications and not only installers.</p>

          </blockquote>NotifyIcon has quite a few bugs. For now use the /SafeMode switch, but eventually I can remove it completely. The icon is supposed to stay there after the installer starts, so it can minimize the setup to the tray. It also gives file copy status in a percentage.<br>
          <br>
          I also cannot use nsExec for the bat script, because it waits for it to finish. That is very slow on my machine, even though it is 1.8GHz.<br>
          <br>
          If you don't want to wait for a new release, you may be able to fix these yourself, since the setup script has been improved to compile inside the ExperienceUI installation folder. All of these bugs *except* the drag problem should be fixed in 1.08.<br>
          <br>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>Skinning for NSIS</strong><br>
          I have written a plug-in that allows one to use Winamp skins to skin the NSIS dialogs. It uses the code from wa_dlg.h and my own code for the skinning of the frame (which was hidden in the Winamp core, but I think I replicated the code very good).<br>
          <br>

          - When uninstalling ExperienceUI, if I just click next, the header color doesn't get redrawn.

This only happens if you run the uninstaller from the setup program.<br>

          <br>
          Other types of problems:<br>
          <br>
          - Do you think it's good deal to install ExperienceUI in two locations, one on NSIS dir, another on Contrib/ExperienceUI? I don't think the copying is necessary.<br>
          - Can't you make an unified header file for the installer of Experience UI so that I can, for example, only need to change the version in just 1 place?<br>
          - There are some problems also in compiling the scripts of your installer. For example, the line "ChangeUI all tinyui.exe" (number 7) gives this error: "Can't find IDC_LIST1 (1016) in the custom UI!".<br>
          - There is also a problem with the StartMenu page on the ExperienceUI installer. If I click on a region on the listbox that don't have items, it gives the folder name "566878", exactly as the define XPUI_LICENSEBKCOLOR value.<br>
          <br>

          Indeed the EXACT same grapics if taken from InstallShield is not allowed, e.g. the PC image on the first screen. But to create something that looks a lot like it can not be forbidden, really. NSIS Modern looks like an MS installer and is also allowed.<br>

          The design of the Modern UI is indeed similar to MS installer, but that's because it uses the standard MS wizard design. MS allows everyone to use this style, because they want Windows application to have a uniform look.</p>

              "Did you contact the company behind InstallShield to make sure that what you are doing is legal? I think it is likely that this design is copyrighted." <i>-Joost Verburg</i>
            </blockquote>Does InstallShield have a left info panel?<br>
            Does InstallShield have a skin platform that changes the skin with one line of code?<br>
            Does InstallShield have a 100KB overhead?<br>
            <br>
            Of course, the answer to all of those is <b>no</b>. The ExperienceUI was created to make NSIS look <i>similar</i> InstallShield, not to duplicate it. Besides, who would want NSIS to look exactly like InstallShield anyway? NSIS coupled with the ExperienceUI is provided as an <i>alternative</i> to InstallShield.<br>
            <br>
            Here is one example:<br>
            KDE (the K Desktop Environment; free; <a href="http://www.kde.org" target="_blank">http://www.kde.org</a>) is a graphical environvent for Linux, just like Windows 95 is a graphical interface for DOS. KDE has a "widget style" called Redmond. The skin looks exactly like the Windows 95/98/ME/2000 visual style. Have the rascals of Redmond taken any legal action against the KDE project? Obviously not. And Microsoft almost certainly knows about KDE.<br>

            <br>
            That's why I think it's better to include only custom designed skins.

            <p class="post-content">What about making a NSIS for MSI platform. You code using NSIS language but end up with a fully-featured Windows Installer after compilation. Would only require rewriting the NSIS compiler to be a processor for NSIS in order to build the MSI database. And then create stub exe/dll files for the functionality in NSIS that is NOT present in Windows Installer service.</p>

              <b>What about making a NSIS for MSI platform.</b>
            </blockquote>NSIS was made to combat the slow Windows Installer platform, not to embrace it! Why should NSIS use the MSI system when its own VM platform it faster and smaller? Also MSI is Windoze only (duh) while the NSIS VM can be easily ported to Linux.<br>
            <br>

            </blockquote>64-bit support would definitely be a good feature. I have not yet moved up to 64 bit, but many have.<br>
            <br>
            Of course dual core CPUs have just hit the market big time, and a lot of gamers/speed lovers have already adopted it. By the time Longhorn hits the shelves, all mid-grade PCs will have at least 2 cores, so eventually dual core will be a must.<br>
            <br>
            Still another nice feature would be Linux ports and such, as Linux (read: Linspire) is spreading like Firefox did.<br>

            <i>Okay. I drop the thoughts about NSIS and MSI then!!!</i><br>
            But: Microsoft only stamps Windows XP Logo on software which is distributed using the Windows Installer system. So I guess logo certification isn't such a big deal for NSIS users??<br>
            <br>
            How would you utilize dual processing power in NSIS? Put the workload of decompressing the files on one core and the installer logic on the other? Will it make installation that much faster?<br>
            <br>
            <b>@JasonFriday13:</b><br>
            When an spplication crashes the Taskbar isn't notified about it and thus can't remove any icons. When you interact with the taskbar notification icon for a no longer exisitin application the taskbar will know the application no longer exist as the window handle of the application is no longer valid.</p>

            So we have a competition going? I did not expect that. OKay. Sounds fun.... I have MS VIsual Studio .NET 2003 with latest Platform SDK installed, so I consider this a head start. I have already downloaded the sample from CodeProject and compiled it successfully. All I need now is a way to get the binary data from the installer database, then write it out.<br>
            <br>
            Is all parts of the MSI database compressed ?? I see some MSI installers just use CAB archive and someone made using "InstallShield for Windows Installer" can't be extracted at all using a standard CAB extractor.</p>

            <br>
            I am the developper of UltraModernUI, I have just release a new plugin for NSIS named skinned button which allows to skin the buttons. It's based on the wansis plgin of saivert<br>
            <br>
            You will find on this French forum a topic relating to it with some screenshots.<br>

            <p class="post-content">Great! Finally my wansis plug-in comes to use elsewhere as well. Just use the source code all you want, but give credit where credit is due (and YES I see you did that).<br>
            <br>
            Hopefully, this experienceUI thing will get popular soon. At least within certain corporations who think full-screen installers are golden.</p>

            <p class="post-content">The UltraModernUI (<a href="http://guerin45.free.fr/UltraModernUI/" target="_blank">http://guerin45.free.fr/UltraModernUI/</a>) concept looks promising. Maybe you guys can work together on this project instead of creating similar things separately.<br>
            <br>
            One thing I really like about the UltraModernUI is that it keeps the original MUI settings. I've learned from user feedback that compatibility is a very important thing (people using the NSIS 2 betas really didn't like the fact that they had to update scripts when the MUI setting system was still under development).<br>
            <br>
            Now we have the standard of MUI settings, I think it would be a very good thing to keep these as a core for even more fancy UIs and add new ones whenever required (like the UMUI settings of the UltraModernUI).<br>
            <br>
            I would also recommend the authors of ExperienceUI and UltraModernUI to work together on a set of custom designed skins. Using copyrighted artwork like those of InstallShield will be a problem when the NSIS developers may decide to include a UI in the NSIS package and could also get your end-users into trouble.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Hello,<br>
            <br>
            I am the developper of UltraModern UI.<br>
            <br>
            I decided to launch the UltraModernUI project mainly because ExperienceUI did not take again the original macros and defines and because I think that it is easier to take again an already functional architecture rather than to rewrite all.<br>
            And also because I had had this idea, few years ago, and that at that time, my knowledge in NSIS was insufficient.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            In this connection, I search somebody who could make an another skin near the installshield but different. Skins which we could share between our two projects.</p>

            <p class="post-content">It is indeed a very good idea to keep using the same setting standards, that is in my opinion the most important thing when creating a new UI.<br>
            <br>
            Maybe you can contact the author of ExperienceUI to see whether you can work on a single UI toghether. You are both doing something nearly identical so merging the projects would save a lot of time and effort.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Yes, but ExperienceUI does not follow the same macro system that ModernUI uses. So UltraModern UI author should convince ExperienceUI author to rewrite ExperienceUI to use same macro as ModernUI. Everybody should follow the macro system that our almighty Joost Verburg designed. Do it and do it now!!</p>

            <br>
            Will rewrite macros/defines for 1.09 or 1.1, depending if I skip 1.09 or not, see below.<br>
            <br>
            I am considering skipping 1.09 or making it a non-public beta of 1.1. If I do make 1.09 a non-public beta, e-mail me, I will accept first four testers. When the first four testers have been accepted, I will announce on this thread.<br>
            <br>
            Anyway, grab 1.08 here:<br>

            <p class="post-content">Yes, I agree. I have used the modern UI for my interface (InstallSpider UI for NSIS) and slightly changed the internal workings so that my UI operates with different bitmaps. I didn't need the header bitmap or the wizard bitmap, this has been replaced as branding image. The interface also looks different.</p>

            Here's a demo setup with running the (for now) unreleased Bryce M1 with <b>wansis</b>. This shows the ExperienceUI's ability to remove all of its internal skinning support to allow 3rd-party skinning plugins. The script I used is included, just for those of you that get to test Bryce M1.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking of which, the first four e-mails I get requesting permission to beta-test will get an activation key and an encryption key to unlock the new ExperienceUI alpha.<br>
            <br>
            This little puppy uses WAnsis and ZmAn3's Forum theme. I also did some of my own images for the bottom panels and such.<br>
            <br>
            Sorry I couldn't attach this in a ZIP, only 7z compressed it &lt;100KB, so you'll need <a href="http://www.7-zip.org" target="_blank">7-zip</a>.<br>

            <p class="post-content">Codename "Bryce" M1 is available! Because 1.1M1 is non-public, you will need to e-mail me. The first four people I get emails from will receive activation keys, so anyone can help test the ExperienceUI version 1.1.<br>
            <br>
            Please note that if you don't get a reply in 3 days, you're out. I will post to the forum here as soon as the fourth tester is enlisted.<br>
            <br>
            The WAnsis teaser installer I posted yesterday is included with this distro, and it has several updates. Also there is some primitive documentation, to get you started. If you are not too experienced with the XPUI, I recommend that you back up the text.htm file before installing this.<br>
            <br>
            Once you have received a confirmation e-mail, you may use <a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/xpui/XPUI-BryceM1.exe?download" target="_blank">this link</a> to download M1.<br>
            <br>
            For security (which I normally stink at) the installer will require an activation key and a decryption key. The activation key is time sensitive (it works for 2 days) and the encryption key (made with DcryptDll) is used to unlock XPUI.nsh and MUIConvert.nsh.<br>

              <p class="post-content">The ExperienceUI has grown into quite a large and complex project, and I believe that it has outgrown this forum thread.<br>
              <br>
              The official ExperienceUI forum can be found at <a href="http://xpui.sourceforge.net/forum/." target="_blank">http://xpui.sourceforge.net/forum/.</a><br>
              <br>
              If you have any ExperienceUI-related questions, comments, or raves, please use the forum or <a href="http://xpui.sf.net/index.php?sec=contact" target="_blank">e-mail me</a>.<br>
              <br>
              You can always download the ExperienceUI at <a href="http://xpui.sourceforge.net/index.php?sec=downloads" target="_blank">http://xpui.sourceforge.net/index.php?sec=downloads</a><br>
              <br>
              And of course, if you've never heard of the ExperienceUI until 5 minutes ago (and I know that most NSIS stuff gets discovered in these forums) you can visit the <a href="http://xpui.sf.net" target="_blank">ExperienceUI website</a> to learn more about skinning the entire installer window.<br>
