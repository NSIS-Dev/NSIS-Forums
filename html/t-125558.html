      <p class="post-content"><strong>console app question</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Situation is, I want to include a console progie to my installer (nsis is the best :)), however it has one anoying (in my case) feature - to quit it you have to press enter-key (i guess it was implemented to let a user see output or something). This proggie works several times during install, and each time user would have to click enter - and that's pointless and irritating.<br />
      Is there some way around this, like emulating a key-press? Terminating a dosbox is not an option, I tried it and it messed up the proggie's work.<br />
      <br />
      PS: I realise that my question is not quite related to NSIS, but I didn't know where else I could ask, and I see lots of experienced people here, programmers and such... :cool:</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could try using</p>
      <pre>
<code>FindWindow $0 "Your Window Title"<br />SendMessage $0 ${WM_KEYDOWN} 13 0</code>
</pre>(note you have to include WinMessages.nsh to define the WM_KEYDOWN variable). This should send a return key press to the window (13 is the ASCII value of carriage return). (<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=86" target="_blank">this</a> might help give you an idea of how SendMessage can be used)<br />
      <br />
      Alternatively something like <a href="http://www.hiddensoft.com/AutoIt/" target="_blank">AutoIt</a> can be used to control applications using key presses and mouse actions.

      <p class="post-content">I think nsExec can also help you. As it runs the console application "inside" NSIS it can't get any output so it won't do nothing when the user presses enter.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the input Sunjammer!<br />

      Tried that AutoIt thingie, it's cool, never thought such tool existed :up:. It managed to emulate pressing return. But I wasn't totally pleased with the result, to do it the perfect way I'd have to spend time learning it's commands, and frankly I'd prefer to spend that time learning nsis :). Plus it adds another exe to my install.<br />
      <br />
      So if you said that it's possible to do it with nsis, that would be so much better. And I'll use AutoIt only as a last resort. :) Anyway, I tried to use the code you gave, and it didn't work out.<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>FindWindow$0 tty // FindWindow $0 "" "nop_up" also worked
<br />&gt;SendMessage $0 ${WM_KEYDOWN} 13 0 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>code above produces some weird sound from pc-speaker (!?), then writes one random symbol to dos-box - so it kinda gets to work: it finds the right window, and writes to it, but not enterkey.<br />
      And out of sudden, sometimes it does nothing at all, sometimes it screws-up the dos-box and one time it even screwed-up keyboard and mouse - they started to work incorrectly. :confused:<br />
      <br />
      btw, from silliness at first I tried looping it, something like:<br />
      <pre>
<code>
loop:
<br />   FindWindow $0 tty
<br />    IntCmp$0 0 done
<br />    IsWindow$0 0 done
<br />    SendMessage$0 0x100 13 0
<br />    Sleep 100
<br />    Goto loop
<br />done: 
</code>
</pre>and it worked the same, continuously making eeck-sounds from speaker, writing crap to dos-box and eventually freezing my pc. :mad:<br />
      Kids, don't try this at home! :D<br />
      <br />
      WTH? Any ideas? Note that I have no experience in programming of any sort, and started to use nsis recently. But I'd really like to get it going. :cool:<br />
      <br />
      TIA,<br />
