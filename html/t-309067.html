      <p class="post-content"><strong>ScrollLicence enabling too soon using RTF</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I am using an RTF file in my licence dialog and am also using the ScrollLIcennse plugin. However when clicking down through the Licence the buttons become enabled after scrolling down about 3 screesn (licence is approx 6 page downs worth).<br />
      <br />
      This behaviour can be seen using the included ExampleNormal.nsi and changing the MUI_PAGE_LICENSE to a large ish RTF file.<br />
      <br />
      Is there some limit on the file size that this can handle?<br />
      <br />
      If I take the rtf file and save it as .txt and include this instead it then works fine.<br />
      <br />
      I've attached an example licence in txt format (can't attach rtf) which if you save as rtf it shows the bhaviour<br />
      <br />
      I've had a look at the cpp but can't really see why this would be happenning unless the rtf send some unexpected line code.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi Stu,<br />
      <br />
      thanks for the quick response, I did have alook at this and If I chane this (It seems to show 9 lines normally) it has a slight differences in that it gets perhaps one page down further before enabling the buttons.<br />
      <br />
      I also set my line to be:<br />
      <br />
      ScrollLicense::Set /NOUNLOAD /LINES 1<br />
      <br />
      and this also didn't help as it it enabled when I get to about line 60 of 130<br />
      <br />
      If I use:<br />
      <br />
      ScrollLicense::Set /NOUNLOAD /CHECKBOX<br />
      <br />
      this seems to work fine and only enables when I get to the bottom</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure what the problem is but I do think the method my plugin uses is rather poor (in my defence I wrote it quite a while ago!)<br />
      <br />
      If I have time this weekend I will re-write.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Stu, as I said I tried to look into fixing itmyself but did get a bit lost..<br />
      <br />
      As a workaround I can use the /CHECKBOX option but if you could look at it, it would be appreciated<br />
