You have to add the "version info" resource to the executable with whatever development environment (tool chain) you are using the develop/build your executable (e.g. Visual Studio).<br><br>BTW: NSIS can add a "version info" resource to the installer executable, but that's not what you want here.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">adeeshah</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th August 2011 15:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">No it doesn't work.
