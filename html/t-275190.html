      <p class="post-content"><strong>Status of UAC Plug-In</strong><br />
      This is my first post in this forum. So, if I'm posting this question in the wrong place please advise.<br />
      <br />
      What's the status of the UAC plug-in?<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in</a><br />
      <br />
      I think it might solve some Vista problems. However the wiki page indicates that it's in an alpha stage. My company is reluctant to let me include it in a solution due to its status. Please advise.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Anders is the developer, he can let you know more.<br />
      <br />
      At our company, we've been using the UAC plugin for our software installer and updater. So far, we haven't had a single report of any problems. This includes hundreds of customers<br />
      <br />
      Though, customers don't seem to point out errors as often as we'd like, so I can't guarantee that every single one functioned without error. But still, it seems to be woring well. Plus from all the heavy testing I did (I was the one who documented some of the UAC plugin and all the test cases), I don't spend any time worrying about it now.<br />
      <br />
      It's Anders plugin, so he gets to make the call. But I'd say because of the testing, I'd rate it as beta.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure what to say really, it is/was a pet project/ POC to show how to start a Medium IL process from a elevated setup. It will probably never reach 1.0 or stable if you will. Still, I am not aware of any real issues other than the fact that it does not report status in the nsis log window. Don't take alpha status to seriously, I can even change it to beta if it makes you feel better ;) Anyway, if you don't want to use the plugin, the only other alternative I can think of is to not start your app from a elevated setup (Disable run checkbox on finish page and whatnot)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks to everyone for the quick reply; very nice forum. As to taking the alpha status too seriously, well corporations have their rules. I appreciate the time and effort that went into providing a solution to what, as far as I can tell, many developers are dealing with.<br />
      <br />
      After evaluating options, we decided to not deal with individual user profiles during installation, but instead create individual user resources as needed during application start-up.</p>
