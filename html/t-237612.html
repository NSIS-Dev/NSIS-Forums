      <p class="post-content"><strong>Can I refresh installer in order to get new system settings?</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      such problem appeared:<br />
      I have to uninstall Cygwin, and install PostgreSQL. I do uninstall step by step as it is described in documentation - stop and remove all services, remove directories and registry,unmount all information related to Cygwin(umount -A, remove the "C:\cygwin\bin" from the systme PATH.<br />
      If I don't remove the "C:\cygwin\bin", usually an error appears on starting PostgreSQL installer, but I am sure it is not in PATH anymore.<br />
      Then I run the PostgreSQL installer and the error still appears. So I think the installer still remember system settings from the moment it has been started, and it knows that "C:\cygwin\bin" is in PATH.<br />
      I tried to split the installer in two parts, one for Cygwin uninstalling and one that starts after that with PostgreSQL installation, but it is the same.<br />
      So, is there way to refresh installer, or restart it again(without rstarting windows), or some other way?<br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You remove it from the path but Windows isn't changing the PATH variable. If you type: echo %PATH% from a DOS prompt you'll notice that Windows still has "c:\cygwin\bin" in it's path. So, you'll need to set the path again using set with all the other paths except the one you don't want. Type: set /? from a prompt to see the options. I've never had to do this so I'm just assuming. I removed a path from my path using the GUI and it didn't reset the PATH variable either until I restarted but SET will also do that.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>No, there isn't.</strong><br />
      Hi, thanks for the reply :)<br />
      I checked PATH, after removing directory from My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt;Advanced -&gt; Environment Variables, with "echo %PATH%" and "SET" commands. In both cases my directory was missing. But when I tried to change PATH with SET command, no, changes appears.<br />
      Thanks anyway, i will read about this more, when I have little time, guess,I can find a solution :).</p>
