      Hello, it's me again!<br />
      <br />
      After creating a lot of product installations for various games, mod's etc, I decided to write this kit for creating basic Self-Installers like that of WinZip and WinRAR (but more beautiful of course :))<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think the combination of Zip2Exe (and Tga2Exe), this UI design and your easy script manipulation (but I think need some improvements, as I'll say below), and the Context Menu shortcut would be excellent!<br />
      <br />
      Just some things though:<br />
      <br />
      1) I think the command names should be in Title Caps and w/o "_" (underscore) characters (like ${SE_FILE} -&gt; ${SEFile}). This will make it more like the NSIS style command names (i.e. SetOutPath).<br />
      <br />
      2) I didn't understand why put "=&gt;" everytime you insert a File into the list of files to be extracted:</p>

      <blockquote>
        ${SE_FILE} "local_path_to\file.ext" =&gt; "output_file"
      </blockquote>As I said before, try to make it like the NSIS command names and parameters styles. It will make the script more compact and easier to produce by hand.<br />
      <br />
      3) The extractor attributes are mostly in <i>!define</i> style, I suggest to change those into <i>!insertmacro</i> or even <i>normal command</i> styles. And change the position of the <i>!include "SE.nsh"</i> to the beggining of the script.<br />
      <br />
      (Uhhuuuu! My Internet conection is flying at speed of light now!)

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the suggestions!<br />
      <br />
      I am still working on adding other bits and bobs. I've allowed for the install details to pop-up over the top.<br />
      <br />
      Now, I can't find a way to change the style of the first line in the listview. Is it possible? Again I don't have access to a list of defines, and the internet never shows anything that I want!<br />
      <br />
      Edit: When I place the !include at the top of the script, the header doesn't see the defines below it (because it goes from the top of the nsi script and down, not the other way round). How does MUI fix this?<br />
      Edit#2: Ohh I see, it uses macro's not defines!<br />

      <p class="post-content">I've done everything you suggested, and I must admit that it looks a lot cleaner now (the Example script that is!)<br />
      <br />
      I just want to embolden the first line of the details window, where it says "Extraction details", because that is for the heading (I want it to stand out).<br />

        Uploaded a new (perhaps final) build.
      </blockquote>Oh oh, I've done small tests and I found some more room for improvement:<br />
      <br />
      <b><i>Script</i></b>:<br />
      <br />
      1) <b>Major Bug:</b>

      <blockquote>
        This one includes ... the "When done, open extraction directory" check-box which replaces the readme check-box if specified
      </blockquote>Strange. I don't see it.<br />
      <br />
      2) <b>Minor Bug:</b>

      <blockquote>
        unknown variable/constant "SE_OVERWRITE_STATE" detected, ignoring (macro:SE_FILE:1)
      </blockquote>When I use the command <i>${SE-NoOverwrite}.</i><br />
      <br />
      3) <b>Minor bug:</b> When I set <i>${SE-Font}</i> to a font, it doesn't set the font before the installation to <i>Extract Progress:</i> label control (see on the left of progress bar), but when I start the installation it changes to the correct font.<br />
      <br />
      4) <b>Suggestion:</b> Default of <i>${SE-Product}</i> should be set to the executable file name without its extention.<br />
      <br />
      5) <b>Suggestion:</b> Default of <i>${SE-OutFile}</i> should be set to the script file name changing only the extention.<br />
      <br />
      6) <b>Minor Suggestion:</b> In the example script, try to use indentation on the code between <i>${SE-FilesStart}</i> and <i>${SE-FilesEnd}</i>.<br />
      <br />
      <b><i>Readme</i></b>:<br />
      <br />
      General: You should make some corrections for the changes you've done:<br />
      <br />
      - <i>${SE-NoOverwritePrompt}</i> is wrong, the correct is <i>${SE-NoOverwrite}</i>.<br />
      - <i>${SE-File}</i> parameters are from a previous version.<br />
      - <i>If undefined</i> term used for all the old version defines that were changed into commands on this version, change to <i>If not used</i>.<br />
      - <i>{SE-NoOpenDir}</i> doesn't exist (because of a checkbox that doesn't exist either).<br />
      - And some others that I don't have patience to look for (at this time in the morning - 4:00 AM - what are you expecting me to do?).<br />
      <br />
      <b><i>General</i></b>:<br />
      <br />
      1) <b>Major Suggestion:</b> An option to create a Start Menu shortcut folder for the files to be extracted.

      <p class="post-content">Okies fixed a lot of the stuff. The reason that you don't have an open-dir check-box is because you cannot have that and a readme check-box. Comment out the readme code and the open-dir check-box will appear. Use ${SE-NoOpenDir} to hide that check-box as well.<br />

      Added new code for shortcuts. No new check-box though, just an optional message box w/ Yes/No.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for searching for the bugs! I should be more thorough myself, but this is just one of my spair time projects (I'm currently working on a map database website for a Half-Life mod.)<br />
      <br />
      They should all be fixed now.<br />
      The first bug was because I didn't use quotes around the define value.<br />
      The second and third bugs were from using !ifdef and !ifndef outside the macro's.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The version number does say that it is a beta and not completed version. So changes are not over yet (however you can see that the list of bugs is much smaller than the older lists):<br />
      <br />
      1) <b>Bug</b>: The readme page is not creating another Internet Explorer window but instead it uses an already existant window. Use an empty string instead of <i>open</i> to use the really default action which is <i>opennew</i> for me.<br />
      <br />
      2) <b>Script Typo</b>: You doubled the same line <i>${SE-OutFile} "NSIS Self-Extractor.exe"</i> in the example script.<br />
      <br />
      3) <b>Minor Bug</b>: When you use a font name with <i>${SE-ExtractListFont}</i> it appears that the font size becomes smaller. Make sure it looks like the same when not using the command and when using the command w/ "Verdana" (if you can).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh, I didn't see that before (I only saw it when I opened the Documentation folder, that means I was looking on an older Readme version).<br />

      It's marvelously excellent! I should borrow some of your codes in Javascript and ActiveX. You've done a lot of work to get there. Very good job, man. But just one thing though, why did you put <i>Skip This Step</i> button enabled on Step 3? You can't skip that part because it's essential!</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's a good point. If you do skip it at the moment, the finish button is disabled (if you do not include a readme as well.)<br />
      <br />
      I just thought though... I should include the readme with the SE-File macro so that the overwrite prompt (if enabled) shows up.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hmmf. It's because I made the kit on Windows XP... the font used there is Verdana size 7. On Windows XP, it's much much smaller (if you look at my screenshot) but for some reason it is larger for you.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Actually, I'm using Xp also, but the first thing I do after I install Xp is turn of that f***ing teletubby theme and go back to classic windows.<br />
      <br />
      &lt;RANT&gt;That XP theme has larger controls, meaning less space left for the really important stuff (such as the source windows when I'm programming)&lt;/RANT&gt;<br />
      <br />
      So, if you want to test yourself, go to your desktop properties and change from windows xp theme to windows classic theme, then you can see for your self (Might be a good idea to save your current theme first, so you can restore it later on)<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and since it's Windows Classic, it'll probably be using MS Sans Serif, 8 pts for the text. That's what windows usually uses everywhere else. ;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'm not going to use ZipDLL, because last time I tried using it for my 'D-Day Zip Extractor' about 10% of the Zip's wouldn't extract. They weren't corrupt either (as WinZip and Windows Explorer could open them.)<br />
      <br />
      I'm using 7-zip's command-line program, but it's a bit on the large side (500kb!)... so does anybody know of a small Zip decompressor program (which only does Zip.)<br />
      I've got pkunzip, but it only allows for short file names/paths which really won't do (program was written over 10 years ago!)<br />

        <p class="post-content">I think the appearance could be better:<br />
        <br />
        - I don't think the "Please enter a directory ..." setence should be with the "Extract to:" label. You should remove one of them.<br />
        <br />
        - Before "Extract to:" was above the textbox text height, now it's below! You should make it to be in the same height of the textbox text height.<br />
        <br />
        - Putting the "Please enter a directory..." in bold doesn't make your program looking better in my opinion. I think that's because the first setence is near title of the program which is bold too.<br />
        <br />
        - This is a very old thing: the ProgressBar and the text on the side positions. ProgressBar should be below the text (you could make the ProgressBar smaller too if you want). This would make the text to have much more space and would make it not to break lines so often.</p>

        <p class="post-content">The "Please enter a directory ..." text is customisable. Like I said, you can use ${SE-ExtractDirTextUnbold}, and set the actual text to whatever you like.<br />
        <br />
        I will make it unbold default, so instead of ${SE-ExtractDirTextUnbold}, one would have to use ${SE-ExtractDirTextBold} (to make it bold again)<br />
        <br />
        Good idea on the progress bar :) Currently the progress text is really jumbled up, and when two lines get in it looks messy.<br />
        <br />
        I'll make the directory box 100% width (without the extract to text) and see what it looks like (with LR padding too of course!) The new text makes the Extract to text redundant now.<br />
        <br />
        I will make the progressbar thinner, stretch out the white area at the bottom and move the progress text label to 100% width over the top.<br />
        <br />
        I may also make the spacing under the two checkboxes bigger too (which will make it more spaced out).<br />

        <p class="post-content">But come to think of it, that would be a cool little feature to have for a Self-Extractor. I use my Self-Exractor to distribute programs and game content for testing. A password would be ideal just in case it got into the wrong hands! I may work on this tomorrow :)<br />

        Hi!<br />
        <br />
        Thank for your update.<br />
        <br />
        1. I am sorry but I have troubles to use it.<br />
        Following error occurs, when I start my simple test script testself.nsi starting makensis:<br />
        <br />
        ..\..\makensis testself<br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Error in script "testself.nsi" on line 23 -- aborting creation process<br />
        <br />
        If I am diabling the line :<br />
        <br />
        ${SE-Password} "rocky"<br />
        <br />
        it's working properly.<br />
        <br />
        2. Question: Is it possible to start an exe file after decompressing(e.g. setup.exe )?</p>

        <p class="post-content"><strong>Starting setup.exe afterwards</strong><br />
        Hi!<br />
        <br />
        Thank you for the password extension.<br />
        Excellent work!<br />
        <br />
        It would be helpful to another function implemented, like it works in Winzip self extractor.<br />
        <br />
        It's like the readme function, but<br />
        <br />
        1. There should be a info text with an enabled button.<br />
        e.g. When done decompression starting: setup.exe<br />
        <br />
        2. This action should start a program (e.g. setup.exe) as last thread after decompressing. Before it is started the main dialogue must be finsihed.<br />
        <br />
        I can do it with the readme function, but the decompression main dialogue is not diappearing before starting the readme.</p>

        HI!<br />
        <br />
        I have checked out, but I had some problems.<br />
        <br />
        1. If I am using the password feature the text is wrong:<br />
        <br />
        Please enter a directory to extract my Mytest files to.<br />
        <br />
        2. If I am using the ${SE-Exec} feature it does only accept one parameter :<br />
        <br />
        !insertmacro: end of SE_README<br />
        !insertmacro: SE_EXEC<br />
        !insertmacro: macro "SE_EXEC" requires 1 parameter(s), passed 2!<br />
        Error in script "examplepw.nsi" on line 16 -- aborting creation process<br />
        <br />
        3. If I am using the exec feature with one parameter, then it's not working and as text "$TEXT" is shown.</p>

        Hi!<br />
        <br />
        Thank you.<br />
        <br />
        Sorry, but I found another problem.<br />
        <br />
        If I am using ${SE-ExecOnClose} the Exec Program is not started. If I am disabling ${SE-ExecOnClose} it works properply.<br />
        <br />
        Another comment. If I am setting also The readme option, the check box for the exec program is not available.</p>

        I've also added ${SE-AutoClose} which makes the Self-Extractor automatically close itself when finished.<br />

        Thank you. Now it's ok.<br />

        Regarding second problem. It seems that only 2 check boxes can be active. So I can't add ${SE-OverwritePrompt}, when ${SE-Readme} and ${SE-OverwritePrompt} are inserted.<br />

        <p class="post-content">This is a very cool util - my first experience with an installer of any kind. I did have a few problems when installing a shortcut using a script created by the script generator (which is also very cool)...<br />
        <br />
        This is what was generated and didn't work:<br />
        ;- Shortcuts to create<br />
        ${SE-ShortcutsStart}<br />
        ${SE-Shortcut} "$DESKTOP\Glow Fish 2.lnk" "$INSTDIR\glowfish2.exe"<br />
        ${SE-ShortcutsEnd}<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I found that changing the middle line to include the middle (2nd) field *did* work:<br />
        ;- Shortcuts to create<br />
        ${SE-ShortcutsStart}<br />
        ${SE-Shortcut} "$DESKTOP" "Glow Fish 2" "$INSTDIR\glowfish.exe"<br />
        ${SE-ShortcutsEnd}<br />
        <br />
        I also had to change "$DESKTOP\Glow Fish 2.lnk" to "$DESKTOP" since the first created an error when the script tried to install the icon at "$DESKTOP\Glow Fish 2.lnk\Glow Fish 2.lnk"<br />
        <br />
        The icon on the desktop also was not the one that I specified using ${SE-Icon}, but was instead the icon that appears with the original .exe file (the one specified with "$INSTDIR\glowfish.exe"<br />
        <br />
        any ideas on the whys, and what can be done?<br />

        <p class="post-content">I'll have a look tonight. It has been a while since I did anything to the ${SE-Shortcut} code. I'll add another field to the ${SE-Shortcut} command perhaps which specifies the icon path to use (or "" to specify default).<br />
        <br />
        I may have used ${SE-Shortcut} simply to keep in with the ${SE-[Command]} syntax style, so you could try using CreateShortcut as a complete replacement.

        The script compiles and executes properly now with the fields as they are generated using v0.20<br />

        My desktop is still not getting the icon that is specified with ${SE-Icon}, and is still getting the icon that appears with the original .exe file<br />

          <br />
          v0.21: Added 'Custom Functions' (see Section 8 in documentation)<br />
          Download from same link.<br />
          <br />
          As for adding extra Self-Extractor code to Zip-To-SE and Dir-To-SE, you just need to put them into the header.nsh files (or you can specify your own header file from the application dialogues).<br />
          <br />
          Edit: What you need to do is use<br />
          ${SE-ExtractEndFunc} myFunc<br />
          then make a function:<br />
          Function myFunc<br />
          ...Put ExecWait (etc) code in here<br />
          FunctionEnd<br />

It took me several tries, and wasn't sure exactly which folder the icon needed to go in, so put it in several - will sort through and determine which is correct, but for now the icon appears on my desktop correctly and it works. Nice job - thanks!!</p>

          <p class="post-content">I just uploaded a new build 0.21b.<br />
          Fixed a few bugs, and added some extra stuff.<br />
          Also cleaned up the readme quite a bit.<br />
          <br />
          ${SE-PageExtractPreFunc} is no longer called in .onInit (no good when you choose to have Password dialogue before Extract dialogue!)<br />
          <br />
          Added ${SE-HeadingLine1} and ${SE-HeadingLine2}<br />
          These allow you to change both lines of the heading text. See documentation for more info (section 1)<br />
          <br />
          Utilised the ${SE-FindExtractDir} code (faster now)<br />
          <br />
          ${SE-Product}, ${SE-HeadingLine1} and ${SE-HeadingLine2} now become their set value after use.<br />

          <p class="post-content">Thanks Afrow UK!<br />
          I like the self-extractor alot! Nice work!<br />
          But I have a question...<br />
          If I would like to add something more in the code (ex. MIDI play during installing), how can I attatch this?<br />
          I have tryed to write it in the SE and SE-Base...<br />
          I need to put some code in the .onInit section, and when I try to make a .onInit section, it returns: The .onInit sections is already there...<br />
          <br />
          Maybe this is silly but can you help me a little? :)<br />

          The installfiles dialog also haves a 10 control and apparently installfiles dialog overlays the 10 control in the main dialog, because it's bigger that the other dialogs. I tryed first just to remove that control from the installfiles dialog, but that didn't work.<br />

          what do i enter for the second one ?<br />

          <p class="post-content">In ${SE-ForceExec} first parameter is the file and the second is open mode action ("open", "print"...) it also can be an empty string to use the default action.<br />
          <br />
          So ${SE-ForceExec} "setup.exe" "" should work just fine.<br />
          <br />
          Look also the ExecShell function in NSIS manual.</p>

          <p class="post-content">Thanks {_trueparuex^}, even I had forgotton what the last parameter was for! I've updated the readme (and changed that ugly colour scheme!)<br />
          So you would like to skip the page sometimes or show the page for X seconds before performing the extraction?<br />

          <p class="post-content">i do not know how to explain this in english. i want the page to appear. not skip it. but i want the extraction to begin automaticaly. not to press on extract !<br />
          so, the user double-clicks on the .exe, the window shows up and it extracts already.<br />
          something like the downloaded nero burning does.<br />

          <p class="post-content">The thing I don't understand is how can the user change the extraction location or other options when the extraction has already started?<br />

          <p class="post-content">I think that o_owd don't know that the extractor actually haves two pages. So there might be misunderstanding about skiping the page.<br />
          <br />
          o_owd the first page is where you set the directory, options and press the extract button and the second page is the one where the progressbar moves and the options and directory field is disabled. Do you want to skip the first page?</p>

          <p class="post-content">Try:<br /></p>
          <pre>
<code>${SE_DIRECTORY_PRE_FUNC} SkipDirectoryPage<br /><br />Function SkipDirectoryPage<br /> Abort<br />FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br />
          <br />
          This may lead to some undesired results as it hasn't been tested but see how it goes. If it doesn't work then I'll probably add a define to the header to disable the page.<br />

          <p class="post-content">hi, I'm very new to the whole NSIS thing (only 2 days :o ), I just wanna ask one thing, can I use this along with the ultra modern ui? that's really cool UI, and if I can use this with this self-extractor, it'll be awesome:D<br />
          <br />
          thanks in advance (sorry if my question is ridiculous, I'm just a newbie;) )</p>
