I want my nsis package to be able to detect if it is there and if not tell the user installing my widget that they need to install Phalanger before my nsis installation will proceed .. what's the problem?<br><br>Thanks for being so helpful.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pospec</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th May 2008 07:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Go to Phalanger forum, ask guys there how could you recognize if it is installed and then come back for help.
