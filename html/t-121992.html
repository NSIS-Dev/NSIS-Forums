Of course, it's more complete than the previous, but it doesn't fit me.<br><br>This is a feeling I have for quite a long time. Today, I wanted information about getting the time stamp of a file. I clicked in "file instructions" and was not there. I searched for "time" and found that the desired information was in "Registry, INI, File Instructions".<br><br>This kind of things happen to me everytime. if I want info about "Goto" I have to use the search because I don't know if goto is a "basic instruction" a "general purpose instruction" or a "flow instruction" (now that I checked I see is a flow instruction, but I won't remember tomorrow because "goto" is kind of basic and general). The problem with searching is that goto is used in exemples and it takes a bit to find what you really want.<br><br>Today I thought that having an alphabetical list of all instructions would work for me. We can include that list as another appendix, "index of instructions", or something.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th January 2003 13:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I fully agree.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">virtlink</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th January 2003 15:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I have HTML Workshop, with which I can create HTML-based help-files.
