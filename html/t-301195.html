      Hi there,<br />
      <br />
      how can I determine the size of all sections of an nsis setup file without running it?<br />
      <br />
      I'm trying to create a wrapper which can contain multiple nsis setup files. The user can select which nsis exes should be executed (in silent mode). Now I would like to know the size of the uncompressed files in the nsis exes before running them, to display this information in the wrapper.<br />
      <br />
      Is there an easy way to do this? Getting the compression rate would also be sufficient...<br />
      <br />
      I already tried to use 7-Zip for this but it doesn't give out details properly (the file sizes are not given for all files). With the command "7z.exe l nsis-file.exe" it lists all the contained files and for most of them also there uncompressed sizes. But not for all which is the problem.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for any reply,<br />
      Joe</p>

      <p class="post-content">if it's all nsis-installers in your wrapper, look in the makensis status window. you can add those to your wrapper using the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.6.1.1" target="_blank">AddSize</a> command.</p>

      Maybe I didn't write clearly enough what my question was. The problem is that I don't know the size of the installed files. I get multiple installers from my client and want to automatically find out the size of the installed files without running the installers.<br />
      <br />
      Of course I could install them one by one on my system to find out, but since I continually get new ones from the client I want to minimize the effort.<br />
      <br />
      Do you have any idea?</p>
