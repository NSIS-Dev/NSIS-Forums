      <p class="post-content"><strong>Cannot get file /x to work in NSIS 2.06</strong><br />
      Just upgraded our NSIS version to the latest, as we were on 2.02, and we need the file exclude /x functionality in 2.03 and later.<br />
      <br />
      I have tried 2.06, and cannot get the exclude to work. What we want to do, is have a single file command with a wildcard to recursivly add everything, and overwrite ALL files, except a single file, where we want to leave it, if it's ready present.<br />
      <br />
      The snippet of code that does not seem to be working is:<br />
      <br />
      SetOverwrite try<br />
      SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"<br />
      File /nonfatal /r /x "DeployFolder\Dont_overwrite_me.pdf" "DeployFolder\*.*"<br />
      <br />
      SetOverwrite off<br />
      File /nonfatal "DeployFolder\Dont_overwrite_me.pdf"<br />
      SetOverwrite try</p>

      <p class="post-content">Have you tried:<br />
      File /nonfatal /r /x "Dont_overwrite_me.pdf" "DeployFolder\*.*"<br />
      <br />
      I think /x only works for <i>file names</i> not full paths.<br />

      <p class="post-content">/x works only with file names, not relative or absolute paths.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What if I have a folder with other subfolders and want to exclude certain files within those subfolders. E.g. let's say I have folder a which contains folders b, c and d. In b, c and d I want to exclude any .tmp files. Also in b, c and d there are files of the same name - bob.txt. But I only want to exclude bob.txt from the c folder. How would I code that? Would I be able to do it in one line or would I have to break it up?</p>
