The old team is long gone and my only co-worker is just a translator, so I have no access to source codes.<br><br>The problem is - I have to run an exe during instalation. It modifies a file about 1.7 GB big in an unknown way (since I have no source code and can't view a file this big with Notepad++).<br><br>If I run the exe myself, just double-clicking it, everything goes fine in any directory.<br>If I move both exe and big file to desktop, it also works perfectly using ExecShell.<br>If I try ExecShell in the original directory (C:\Program Files\...), the exe file reports, that it couldn't access a file to modify.<br><br>So any ideas what's wrong? If I run that exe from Program Files myself, it works just fine. Something about admin rights?<br>I tried setting RequestExecutionLevel to both admin &amp; highest, but it didn't help.<br><br>Also - I've noticed the same problems with ExecWait and Exec. All of them fail in Program Files subdirectories.<br><br>Just an amusing fact - I tried InstallShield installer, set the exe to "Run when installer closes" (checkbox on the last page) and it worked ok, overcoming execution restrictions.<br>But it's not an estetic way to let user uncheck execution of mandatory operations, so I'd rather look for a NSIS-based solution.<br><br>Thanks in advance.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th January 2012 05:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">First of all: Program Files is a protected directory. You need administrator access to modify files there.<br><br>Second: requestexecutionlevel does nothing on WinXP and earlier, or when UAC is turned off in Vista/7. You need to use the UserInfo plugin to verify that the installer has admin access.<br><br>Third: Perhaps you need to set the working directory before you execute? Use SetOutPath.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">erundil</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th January 2012 16:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Wow, thanks, it helped. I didn't even have to use the plugin.<br><br>It was just setting the proper outpath...<br><br>The problem was that I installed the exe to $INSTDIR, then SetOutPath to $INSTDIR\videos<br><br>I had no idea, it could mess things up, so thanks again. :)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
