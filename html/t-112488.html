So you can use all variables for your own code.<br><br>Also, the macro's are smaller because of the new page system.<br><br><b>Basic Macro System</b><br>If you were using the Basic Macro System of Modern UI 1.3 final, you only have to make a few small changes in your script:<br><br>* Remove MUI_BASICFUNCTIONS_INIT<br>* Rename MUI_COMPONENTPAGE to MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE<br>* Rename MUI_DIRSELECTPAGE to MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE<br><br><b>Advanced Macro System</b><br>The advanced macro system is way easier now. You can add an Install Options page by just adding one Page command and a function, see the Readme for more info.<br><br>If you were using the Advanced Macro System, you'll have to update your script to the new page system. Have a look at InstallOptions.nsi to see all the changes.<br><br><b>Translation</b><br>I have updated all language files to the new 1.4 format. If you want to update your language files, please download the updated files first.<br><br>If you want to contribute a new translation, have a look at "Contrib\Modern UI\Language Files" to see how you can make a Modern UI translation.<br><br>There are also some NLF language files that need to be updated (accelerator keys should be added).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">muz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd November 2002 16:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">hey Joost, when i selected to browse for the install directory the dialog that appears has a pretty large gap at the top and then just the directory listing, it should have a smaller gap and some text saying "Choose installation directory" or something, nothing major, just a ittle UI hack i guess, well i still get it in this version, if it is fix i guess i need to try a clean install. thanks<br><br>luke.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd November 2002 19:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd November 2002 19:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">That's not what he is talking about, look again ;)<br>I will try to fix it tomorrow.<br>What you are talking about, Joost, is impossible...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd November 2002 19:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Because the Modern UI should have a different text on the NSIS page and the Browse for Folder dialog, DirText should have an option to use the text only on the Browse for Folder dialog.<br><br>I will also make some changes to the Advanced Macro System when I have time for it (macro's for the default Page functions).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd November 2002 23:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><b>Macro System Update</b><br><br>I made a lot of updates to the macro system.<br><br>It's now possible to use the basic macro's even if you are using custom pages.
