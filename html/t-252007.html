For those of you who are familiar with writing MFC apps using Visual Studio, I'm trying to achieve the equivalence of an "IP Address Control."<br><br>Basically I want the textbox to look like a normal one, except with four periods. Here is an example:<br><br><a href="http://joe.jmcc00l.googlepages.com/maskedtextbox.bmp" target="_blank">http://joe.jmcc00l.googlepages.com/maskedtextbox.bmp</a><br><br>When the user tries to type something in, I want to restrict their input to only numbers, three digits at a time. For example, when I type in "192" I want the cursor to parse just past the first period. In the case "." is typed I want to parse past the next period. This is implemented in Windows' TCP/IP connection properties dialog, which can be reached in WinXP by opening Network Connections and right clicking on a connection-&gt;Properties and clicking on Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) and clicking Properties button.<br><br>I know it's not straightforward to do something like this using InstallOptions, but I would like to know if any of you have seen or written a plugin that might help. As always, any help is greatly appreciated :D.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Joe</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th July 2006 00:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You could try my PassDialog serial page, which sort of does this, except you'd need to edit the code so that it only accepts numbers (or you could just do a validation check on page leave).<br><br><a href="http://nsis.sf.net/File:PassDialog.zip" target="_blank">http://nsis.sf.net/File:PassDialog.zip</a><br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JoeMcC00L</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th July 2006 14:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thank you for the quick reply. Great work on the plugin. This is very close to what I want, but not quite.<br><br>I guess I should have cleared this up in my initial post: I currently have an InstallOptions page that reads in two ip-addresses and two subnet masks (in form 192.168.1.0/16). Is there a way to incorporate this into an InstallOptions script (or something to that effect)?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th July 2006 17:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Have you tried InstallOptionsEx?<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JoeMcC00L</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">28th July 2006 19:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I've tried using InstallOptionsEx, but I couldn't even get the test script to display correctly.
