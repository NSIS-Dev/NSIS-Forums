      <p class="post-content"><strong>Silent install and the SelectSection macro</strong><br />
      Okay, so I've just discovered that .onGUIInit and page callbacks do not work during a silent install.<br />
      <br />
      What I am trying to do is check command line parameters for a silent install, and based on those parameters, use the SelectSection macro to turn on a section (they are all off by default). However I have yet to get it to work silently.<br />
      <br />
      What would be the proper way to achieve this silently? I really want to avoid having the sections checked by default and then using IfSilent within the section to skip the code if the parameter was not given.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There's no need to check the command line parameters manually, you can use IfSilent. That, along with UnselectSection macro from Sections.nsh, should be enough. See the attached file for an example.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry, I didn't mean that I was checking if the installer was actually silent, I meant I was checking if a command line parameter existed, and then enabling the section via SelectSection. However, this is not working when silent.<br />
      <br />
      So like /feature1, /feature2 etc.<br />
      <br />
      If /feature1 switch exists, then I use SelectSection ${feature1} etc.<br />
      <br />
      However, this is NOT working for me in .onInit, and I have it placed as the last code in .onInit. To check, I even stripped out all the parameter checking, and just did:<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro SelectSection ${feature1}. The section is off by default, and whether I run it via command line or just double click the icon, when it gets to the component page that section is still not turned on.<br />
      <br />
      I added a MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_GUIINIT command, stuck the SelectSection macro in a function that it called, and it DID work, but of course not when silent, only when ran by just double clicking the icon.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      So something, somewhere is not letting the SelectSection, ReverseSection, and UnselectSection macros work during .oninit for me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Are you sure ${feature1} is defined at that point of the script? MessageBox it and make sure it's not empty.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you kichik.<br />
      <br />
      It turns out I am an idiot. Prior to the call at the very end of .onInit, I had a function that checked if the user was connected to the internet, if they are I returned from the function, and if they weren't I wrote to some ini files. Since my test machine is always connected to the internet, it was always returning from the function and the SelectSection macro was never getting selected.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway though, I realized this and instead of using Return I did label jumps (which I should have anyway), and now it's all working.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thanks again for all your help.</p>
