      <p class="post-content"><strong>FileRead - Read data WITHOUT caring about &lt;CRLF&gt;</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I have a question/comment about FileRead.<br />
      <br />
      I have a file of data that is NOT binary data, but I do NOT want to parse it on a line by line basis either, but instead grab chunks of the file at various offsets as needed.<br />
      <br />
      The problem is that FileRead will read up to a CRLF, and then return with that set of data regardless of the value of [maxlen] that I provide to the FileRead command.<br />
      <br />
      What I am looking for is for FileRead to have an option to simply ignore CRLF, and just return up to [maxlen] data that I provide to the command, OR, if the file is at EOF, return whatever data there is up until EOF.<br />
      <br />
      So what I have done as a patch, is change FileRead to allow for negative values in [maxlen].<br />
      If a negative value is passed in, we mark a flag to tell it to NOT quit reading after finding a CRLF, but instead to keep going until maxlen is reached, or we run into the end of the file.<br />
      <br />
      This patch works well, and I would like to submit it, to hopefully be taken.<br />
      <br />
      However, I am thinking instead of overriding the functionality of FileRead, maybe I should make a new command?<br />
      <br />
      Thoughts? Suggestions?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I thought of that, but there are 2 problems with doing it that way...<br />
      <br />
      1) The FileReadByte translates the byte read into an integer.<br />
      &gt; The byte is stored in the output as an integer (0-255).<br />
      <br />
      2) I need to read very relatively large data files. Probably 10 M's or larger.<br />
      Calling that function, and reading each BYTE by BYTE is going to be horribly inefficient, and converting each integer read back into a string is even more horribly inefficient.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I had thought of making a new command called FileReadBytes that would take an optional [maxsize] parameter, but since FileReadByte does the BYTE -&gt; int transalation, it seems like I should stay away from that name, since my new function would NOT translate the data read.</p>

      <p class="post-content">As long as you don't keep calling the function in a section (thus moving the progress bar) then it shouldn't be that slow. To prevent that, call your function from within a function which itself is called from within a section.<br />
      You can use IntFmt $out %c $in to convert the ASCII value to a character. Don't forget you are only limited to 1023 characters in NSIS (or 8191 if using the special build).<br />
