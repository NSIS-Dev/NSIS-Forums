      <p class="post-content"><strong>WriteRegStr Failure</strong><br />
      Ok, the first I wanna say is:<br />
      <br />
      NSIS is great!<br />
      <br />
      I tried Install Shield and any other Programs before, but nothing satisfied me like NSIS<br />
      <br />
      the 2nd thing: My English is bad, don't worry about it<br />
      <br />
      ok, now the most important thing of this post<br />
      <br />
      There is an Error in the Command WriteRegStr...<br />
      <br />
      I Wrote a Program which needs a Password depending on the Database, so I used a var to write the Password in the registry. So far so good - executing the Setup it writes the<br />
      key_name in the subkey, but no value - if I change the key_name it writes the value<br />
      :igor: I don't know what NSIS doesn't like on PWD as key_name, because it accepts PWX or PWA or anything like this... hope anyone can help me to get this f*cking PWD in the Registry<br />
      <br />
      thanks in advance<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Willkommen zu den Foren<br />
      ^^Thanks :D I didn't expect that ;)<br />
      <br />
      ok, it looks like this:<br />
      <br />
      .<br />
      . (other stuff)<br />
      .<br />
      var PWD<br />
      .<br />
      . (other vars, sections and stuff like that)<br />
      .<br />
      StrCpy "$PWD" "JW463;"<br />
      WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\MyProg" <font color="red">"PWD"</font> "$PWD"<br />
      .<br />
      . (other stuff)<br />
      .<br />
      <br />
      first I thought it happened because of the ';' but without this it didn't work, too.<br />
      <br />
      then I tried other values for $PWD but there was no result<br />
      <br />
      then I just changed <font color="red">"PWD"</font> to "PWE" and it worked fine...<br />
      <br />
      sombody could think it would be easier to change <font color="red">"PWD"</font> but there are a few Customers I would have to update, because all of them have a PWD Field in the registry<br />
      <br />
      if there are still open questions, you can also write a mail or a PM<br />
      <br />
      come on don't be shy ;)<br />
      <br />
      Hope this wasn't too bad english</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>worried</strong><br />
      Ok, I tried it with another script again<br />
      <br />
      and it worked... :igor:<br />
      <br />
      I copied the few lines into my other script and it still didn't...<br />
      <br />
      I don't know whats going on there<br />
      <br />
      I had an error like this with another script, I tried and tried but it didn't work after a reinstallation of NSIS it worked<br />
      <br />
      am I stupid or are there known errors like this?<br />
      <br />
      *throwing the PC through the window*<br />
      much better<br />
      <br />
      now in serious, which I make wrongly?<br />
      <br />
      EDIT:<br />
      <br />
      I have the Error:<br />
      <br />
      WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\My Prog" "PWD" "$c_PWD"<br />
      ^^doesn't work<br />
      <br />
      WriteRegStr HKLM Software\MyProg "PWD" "$c_PWD"<br />
      ^^works fine<br />
      <br />
      But there is the problem that I have to use THIS sub_key...<br />
      It seems to be a "bug" in NSIS - hope anyone has an Idea how to fix it</p>

      <p class="post-content">That is not going to work. If you think it's a NSIS bug, please create a script that reproduces the problem and submit a bug report at the project page.</p>
