I think the /nonfatal switch for File is what I want, however it does not seem to work recursively? Unless I'm making a stupid mistake?<br><br>Explanation...<br>I want to be able to use the File command, recursively, and nonfatally.<br>I want to be able to do something like...<br>File /r "../STUFF/*.*"<br>and have it just be ignored if the STUFF directory does not exists, OR if the STUFF directory is empty. If STUFF is present and does contain files I want them to be compressed and added to my archive.<br><br>File /r /nonfatal "../STUFF/*.*" does not seem to work!! It presents the "no files found" error at compilation.<br><br>What kind of logic can I write that would be able to test if a file/directory, relative to the compiler, is present? IfFileExists will not work for me because it is doing a compare of the end-user situation at runtime, and I require this kind of logic at the compiler. I'm familiar with {If} and all that logic, but how to I ask it about files relative to the compiler?<br><br>Any ideas?<br><br>Thanks<br>-Michael</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd January 2007 17:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>File /r /nonfatal "../STUFF/*.*" does not seem to work!!

The act of determining if it exists or empty isn't for my own edification. I need the script to be flexible enough to determine this by itself.<br>(unless you mean there's a way to use "windows explorer" though scripting means to do this? If so, please elaborate.)</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd January 2007 18:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>yeeeaaahhh see I know ../STUFF/ is empty.
