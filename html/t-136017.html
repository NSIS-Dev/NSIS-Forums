My hat goes to you.<br><br>Is it at all possible to change the color of the header font in MODERN_UI? I would like to be able to make it white. Also, can the header text be moved/aligned in any way, whether through a ResHacker or, perhaps, in a simpler fasion through the installer script?<br><br>And last, is there any forum discussion/link regarding the use of the different MODERN_UIs, for e.g sdbarker_tiny. I'd like to make a patch installer combined with VPatch, and minimal user interaction.<br><br>Hope I didn't overwhelm you with questions.<br>Thank you in advance!<br><br>Tigran</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th May 2003 17:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I don't think it is possible to change the colours of text on NSIS dialogs as yet, but I know that Kichik could code it in easily (it's on the ToDo list)<br><br>The best and probably only way to move the text over, would be to put in some spaces :p<br>I may be wrong though!

Now, you'll ask why can't I use a different color? Company branding restrictions. :rolleyes: Could this be done through Windows API/custom DLL, since the labels are just standard windows controls, and we can already change the background color? I just don't want to reinvent the bicycle if this is in the works.<br><br>As far as the use of different modern interfaces, I was just looking for more information on their usage.
