      <p class="post-content"><strong>text longer than 3 lines in finishpage</strong><br />
      sorry if i start to nerve with my wishes to the finishpage, but i need to have the checkbox AND a text, which is longer than 3 lines on that page. I try this by adding a variable to the correct text in my mui language-file. that variable is filled with a string in my .oninit-function. if i don't set the MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN function and the checkbox is invisible, everthing's ok. but if i show the checkbox, the label will be hidden, except of 3 lines. That's not enough. Any tips to solve that? split the text won't help. enlarging the checkbox-label, so that the text can be shown there would be fine, but it's not defined in the ioSpecial.ini, is it? i only found a checkbox in another ioSpecial.ini wich i found in Local Settings/Temp . But i don't know how to work with it.<br />
      <br />
      Help! it's getting a little urgent.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To solve this you have to write to ioSpecial.ini a new height to the check-box in question. It's usually Field 4 for the check-box (used to be anyway). Do this with !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE "ioSpecial.ini" "Field 4" "Height" "x"<br />
      Start with a large height value first and then work your way down.<br />
      <br />
      Note that it might be a completely different field so just mess around with the field numbers too if #4 does not work.<br />

      <p class="post-content">thanks. i think now i understand the theory of the ioSpecial.ini . Didn't thought about MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE .<br />
      <br />
      But if i do this:<br />
      <br />
      Function SetCheckbox<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE "ioSpecial.ini" "Field 4" "Height" "100"<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE SetCheckbox<br />
      !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN "$commonfiles\blabla.exe"<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
      <br />
      I get these error-message:<br />
      Function: "SetCheckbox"<br />
      !insertmacro: MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE<br />
      !insertmacro: macro named "MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE" not found!<br />
      <br />
      ...anything i have to !include ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">i don't have to do something like...<br />
      <br />
      File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\blabla.ini "blabla.ini"<br />
      or<br />
      InstallOptions::dialog "$PLUGINSDIR\blabla.ini"<br />
      <br />
      ...if i just want to modify the finishpage, right?<br />
      <br />
      or could it be easier to build a custom page, that takes place of the finishpage and integrate the finishpage_run function?<br />
      <br />
      another question: how can i find out which function revers to which "unit"? and: can i save my own functions in units and call them like e.g. GetVersionDLL ?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think your SetCheckbox function needs to be further down in your script after your page macros. Also, change "Height" to "Bottom".</p>

      <p class="post-content">!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE was wrong...<br />
      <br />
      !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE is correct ...maybe i should read more exactly....but you could have seen that, too ;) ...</p>
