      I was just wondering why the install and uninstall icons have to be the same size and build? Can you change this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">i have been able to solve this by<br />
      heading to the main Configuration files and changing the<br />
      Default ICON<br />
      <br />
      for some reason in there programming they<br />
      have made it so that the first install and the 2nd uninstall icon have to be the same SIZE.......<br />
      <br />
      wierd :(<br />
      <br />
      They don't need to include a editor or anything but<br />
      only need to lift the restriction of matching icons :)<br />
      and that's done in the programming :)<br />
      <br />
      "I think someone would have to see a need for it I guess<br />
      and that would depend on the programmers"<br />
      <br />
      It's easier then you might think.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I do know where I am talking about.<br />
      <br />
      If the installer generates the uninstaller it replaces the icon data.<br />
      <br />
      To support different installer/uninstaller icon sizes the installer would have to include a resource data editor (which would waste a lot of space).<br />
      <br />
      Usually people have the same icons formats for similar icons.<br />
      <br />
      To change icons you don't have to modify anything, just use the icon settings in your script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try that with the Modern UI<br />
      Because when i tried using differn't icons<br />
      event the ones supported in the program<br />
      if it wasn't the same size the compile would fail on it<br />
      <br />
      but when I changed the Modernui File<br />
      Located at C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI<br />
      at lines 105 and 106<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_ICON "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-blue.ico"<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_UNICON "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-grey.ico"<br />
      <br />
      If they don't match they fail<br />
      the Defualt if I remember right was<br />
      modern-install.ico<br />
      and if I tried to replace it with<br />
      modern-install-blue.ico it would work because they are both 14k and then when I tried to do it with<br />
      modern-install-blue-full.ico<br />
      or any other file that had the same color pallete and the same colors or close to it<br />
      I could not use them unless they matched the Defualt mentioned ICO referance :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">You are really making things too difficult. You don't have to hack any Modern UI files to change the icons. You only have to define MUI_ICON and MUI_UNICON.<br />
      <br />
      Your icons don't have to match the default icons, the only requirement is that your installer and uninstaller icons have the same image formats. That should not be a big problem, because almost everyone ones the same icon format for two similar things.<br />
      <br />
      It's not about the size of the compiler, it's about the size of generated installers. It's about your customers who have to download or store your installers.<br />
      <br />
      Including a resource data editor in the installer executable would really be a waste of space.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You don't seem to get my point. I'm explaining you why there is this restriction and why it should not be a problem.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Oh i forgot to tell you I did try that already and that's what braught me to hacking the files in the first place :):up:<br />
      <br />
      Make it look like this<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_ICON "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-blue.ico"<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_UNICON "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\modern-uninstall-colorful.ico"<br />
      <br />
      and you will get this error<br />
      Error finding icon resources: number of icons doesn't match -- failing!<br />
      Error - aborting creation process<br />
      <br />
      or can use the Thing you mentioned and name them that and compile and see what happens you will get the same error :(<br />
      <br />
      the Only way i have been able to get around this is go back to the Original files and edit them .</p>

      <p class="post-content">my dear. he said:<br />
      DEFINE them, not insert macros, that dont exist!<br />
      u should use these commands:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>!define MUI_ICON "installer.ico"<br />!define MUI_UNICON "uninstaller.ico"</code>
</pre><br />
      that's working for me, and, believe me, i know too what i'm talking about.

      <p class="post-content">I did define them in the install<br />
      but when ever I had 2 icons of differn't sizes<br />
      the compiler would error<br />
      <br />
      Only when I went into the main configuration files and changed the insert macro Default icon is when it changed for me<br />
      <br />
      if i changed the default icon size i could then define<br />
      in the install script any icon of that same size<br />
      and that would work as long as i defined 2<br />
      of the same size icons that matched the size of<br />
      "The Icon Mentioned in the main Configuration file"<br />
      that's what I have found :(<br />
      <br />
      But then again it may be because of the Operatig system<br />
      or other programs running that could interfere with<br />
      Nsis ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Please read what I posted at least 5 times.<br />
      <br />
      You <b>can not</b> use two icons of a different size. That is just how it works, because the installer has to overwrite the icon data when generating the uninstaller.<br />
      <br />
      Whether you set it in your script or do anything else, that makes no difference.<br />
      <br />
      It has nothing to with operating systems or other applications.</p>

      <p class="post-content">where's the problem? if you want your installer to have a 4 color icon, but your uninstaller to have a 16 million color icon, just save the 4 color icon in 24bit. really no big deal.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanx we were trying to figure out what was wrong with the icons was it the default size and such<br />
      <br />
      but I was hoping it did go by a pallete<br />
      <br />
      we needed someone that knew the real information<br />
      of why we were getting conflicts with difern't icons<br />
      thank you.<br />
      <br />
      so 24 bit icons don't have conflicts with all the other stuff ? if that's true man thax I've been waiting to<br />
      here some more cool stuff :)<br />

      I never had so much fun with a installer.<br />
      <br />
      How did this come down to 1 itty bitty icon ?<br />
      If windows allows for many colored icons and uninstaller icons and alot of other installers allow for this can we not have the same functionality ?<br />
      <br />
      Can we vote on this ?:eek: :igor:</p>
