      <br>
      it should be something like:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with that, but the problem is that it is not possible to use tags within values, for example, if I want the word 'license' to be <b>bold</b>:<br></p>
      <pre>

</pre><br>
      The above example is impossible.<br>
      <br>
      Using my code, it is possible:<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>&lt;tbl&gt;<br>  &lt;!-- &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th width="25"&gt;Option&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th width="75"&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; --&gt;<br>  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;license&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Displays a license page.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>  &lt;!-- etc... --&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/tbl&gt;<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Another thing about your example: you use (very) long tag names (e.g. pissibleParmOptionsList&gt; (I used 'tr' and 'td' only because people know them from HTML). I don't know whether this was only for illustration, but it is better to if you don't use very long names. People can easely make typo's in long names. And I prefer all tagnames to be lowercase, since the XSLT (XML stylesheet) is case-sensitive.<br>
      Your idea is a good idea, but it limits the possibilities of XML and XSLT.<br>
      <br>
      And about the images used: I can use any color, any icon, any image, as long as it is jpeg or gif. Any suggestions for the colors?

      <p class="post-content">The style for a certain field will always be te same, style and content should be separated. CSS will be used for the styles.<br>
      <br>
      It really should be easy to update, using HTML formatitting is no option. We won't move to another system when the maintenance will become more difficult.<br>
      <br>
      About the lay-out: I don't like the light blue background image and the small margins. The page is also not really compatible with Mozilla. The XML version has quite some problems, but also the images in the HTML version do now show up right.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the large number of files (one for each command), it should also be possible to create a HTML Help file.<br>
      <br>
      If these problems can be solved it would be a nice system for the documentation. The only problem is the move from Halibut: everything has to be converted.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So, with a bit work, it would be possible to let it generate XML and push it trough the Saxon XML parser.<br>
      And that bold thing, it was just an example.<br>
      <br>
      I have been thinking about Halibut for a week now, and I came up with the following idea:<br>
      <br>
      - When a line doesn't start with a function (i.e. /A), then that line is treated as being a paragraph (like now), and results is: &lt;t&gt;(contents)&lt;/t&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      - When a line does start with a function, but no '{' sign follows, the rest of the line (untill the CrLf) is treated as being the parameter of that function (currently, that happens).<br>
      <br>
      - When a line does start with a function, and a '{' sign follows, the rest of the text, untill the right '}' is found, is treated as being the parameter of that function. This way, you can create a code block like this:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>/c{<br>This is code<br>This is code<br>This is also code<br>}<br></code>
</pre><br>
      Instead of this:<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>/c This is code<br>/c This is code<br>/c This is also code<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      What do you think?
