      my installer distfiles are located on a network share, which could be mounted with \\server\sharename or mounted as a drive. in either case, all one has to do to generate an installer is double-click the binary i made that calls makensis-bz2.exe - which is located in that directory.<br />
      <br />
      this enables the developers to be able to generate installers with a script (or do it as needed) without having to have nsis installed on their own machines.<br />
      <br />
      i just tried out nsis2, and makensis.exe fails when run from a network share when it looks for plugins. copying the plugins directory to the network share did not help, not did specifying /noconfig / etc. any ideas? could this be a bug?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I do something very similiar using vbscript to copy files into a certain directory (again, on a network share) and making an NSIS to distribute these files. I believe I had a problem where if my paths were not absolute in the .NSI script, I had to either make them absolute or set my working directory for the script. I dont' remember exactly but I'll check at work tomorrow, but look at that.</p>
