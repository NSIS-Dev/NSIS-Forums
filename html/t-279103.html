      <p class="post-content">NSIS doesn't mirror dialogs on runtime. It creates them at build time. Some styles don't take affect immediately after SetWindowLong or at all after the control is created. So you'll have to edit the resources using Resource Hacker after building the installer.<br>
      <br>
      You can also create your own UI based on Contrib\UIs\modern.exe and add the styles you don't want it to have. The dialog manager xors styles it wants to add to make a dialog RTL. So if you add the styles, it'll actually remove it while trying to add it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the info, the problem is fixed for the most part.<br>
      <br>
      I've noticed that if multiple languages are included, the installer will include multiple mirrored versions of dialogs (eg dialogs 202, 302 mirrored for 102).<br>
      <br>
      Why are there multiple versions and how to tell which version belongs to which language? for example, I only want to replace the license dialog for Hebrew, how can we know which resource to replace?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">It adds a dialog set for each different setting it needs to apply. If a specific language has a different font or it's RTL, it'll add a new dialog set for it. Those can't be easily done in runtime so they're prepared in compile-time.<br>
      <br>
      There's no defined set of rules for the order of the dialogs. Currently, it depends on the order in which you've inserted the languages. So long as you don't add new languages, change fonts or RTL and the relevant source code in makensis.exe doesn't change, it's safe to assume the number will stay the same. DOn't forget to make sure it does when one of those change.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks I'll have to come up with a way to track the languages added and work out the dialog ids for RTL languages (no font settings in the script) and make needed changes with packhdr to avoid any CRC issues.<br>
      <br>
      Its becoming slightly complex for a simple thing like an LTR license in an RTL page, seemingly because ES_LEFT and WS_EX_LTRREADING dont have any effect once the RichEdit is created with the ES_RIGHT and WS_EX_RTLREADING styles.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks again for all the details, at least the problem is solved.</p>
