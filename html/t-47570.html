      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      really cool tool!<br />
      <br />
      But I think there is one feature missing:<br />
      I need to get some information from the user, e.g<br />
      name, additional install directories, ...<br />
      Is there a way to prompt for such strings? There are<br />
      user defined variables, but it seems, I can only set their<br />
      value within the script.<br />
      Ok, I could open a temporary ini file that asks the user to<br />
      fill in everything in notepad. This file then could be read by the installer, but what if the user doesn't save it?<br />
      A separate tab in the installer that can be reached via the<br />
      next-buttons would be much better.<br />
      Maybe a popup-window would do, if it returns a string.<br />
      Is there such a feature planned?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I would also find this useful. Just a simple one question dialog would be OK for me (I'd just call multiple times). This should be easy to do and data would probably be treated like registry read user variables (maybe need more than 9 though)...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Most definately it would be of use. I've found that installation of Java apps can be a pain when the target audience is not Java aware. Currently I am just blindly redisting the JRE as per the JRE license in a sub dir of my app. Prefereably, I would give the user another select dir dialog like the first one.<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">In my opinion this is the one feature that<br />
      professional installers have and NSIS doesn't.<br />
      Is there any chance this is going to be seen<br />
      in NSIS soon?<br /></p>
