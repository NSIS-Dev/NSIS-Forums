NSIS definitely needs a better way to create owner dialogs than InstallOptions, which is big, and not exactly practical. I managed to get the dll down to around 7k or so by cutting out everything I didn't need, and re-writing parts of it. But, that was still too big for my tastes, since with that 7k, I still needed to include several parts of NSIS that I didn't need before to even be able to USE the dll. So, I just had to find an alternate route.<br><br>-Scott</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">snowchyld</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th August 2002 04:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">:weird:<br><br>if i get time / motivation i'll look into hacking a nicer way of doing things [for me :D ]<br><br>im just finishing off the new fadeSplash as we speak.. hopefully it will work on win9X/ME as well now..<br><br>i just have to find someone with a win9X machine to test it on<br><br>then its back to NSI scripting ;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th August 2002 09:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>then its back to NSI scripting</blockquote>scripting *cough* -- more like fudging bodging and fumbling...
