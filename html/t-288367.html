      <p class="post-content"><strong>Odd AccessControl error</strong><br />
      I'm using the AccessControl plugin to set the rights on a data directory set up by my installer. The directory is freshly-created and known to exist, so the user running install will be its "CREATOR OWNER" and should have authority to set the access.<br />
      <br />
      However, I'm occasionally -- not always, but I haven't spotted a trend -- getting error "22" returned. Looking at the source for the plugin I see that errors are usually textual, and that "22" doesn't seem to be one of them!<br />
      <br />
      Here's the code snippet:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />    ; create the data directory<br />    ClearErrors<br />    CreateDirectory "$MBDir"<br /><br />    ${If} ${Errors}<br />      Abort "Can't create MessageBase directory $MBDir"<br />    ${EndIf}<br /><br />    ; Set access permissions on $MBDir -- read write accessible by all users<br />    ; We have to use "(S-1-1-0)" instead of "World" or "(WD)" for Win2k<br />    ClearErrors<br />    AccessControl::GrantOnFile "$MBDir" "(S-1-1-0)" "GenericRead + GenericWrite + DeleteChild"<br />    pop $0<br /><br />    ${If} $0 != ""<br />       MessageBox MB_OK "Error $0 granting access to $MBDir "<br />    ${EndIf}<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      The message I'm getting in the message box is typically something like "Error 22 granting access to E:\MyApp\Data ". The directory name is correct, and the directory has been created.<br />
      <br />
      Can anyone tell me what this actually means? I take it I am calling the plugin correctly, and that GrantOnFile is meant to be usable on directories as well as normal files?<br />
      <br />
      The Windows error code 22 is ERROR_BAD_COMMAND which is documented as meaning "The device does not recognize the command". I believe that's normally returned by IOCtl-type calls to devices, and not by access control APIs.<br />
      <br />
      I'm testing this on XP64, BTW, but it's intended to be usable on all NT-class systems.

      <p class="post-content">AccessControl does not push anything to the stack if there were no errors. Therefore your value in $0 is coming from a stack item that was already on the stack before you called the plug-in.<br />
      <br />
      I will change this in the next version.<br />

      </blockquote>OK, thanks, Stu ... that makes sense.<br />
      <br />
      What's the best workaround? Is there any other indication of an error -- way to tell whether anything has been pushed onto the stack -- apart from calling pop?<br />
      <br />
      I could do something like:<br />
      <pre>
<code><br />ClearErrors<br />Push "OK"<br />AccessControl::GrantOnFile "$MBDir" "(S-1-1-0)" "GenericRead + GenericWrite + DeleteChild"<br />pop $0<br /><br />${If} $0 != "OK"<br />   MessageBox MB_OK "Error $0 granting access to $MBDir "<br />   pop $0   ; remove the "OK"<br />${EndIf}<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      Can you think of anything better?<br />
      <br />
      Cheers,<br />
      Daniel.
