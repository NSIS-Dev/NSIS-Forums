The memory could not be "read". Click on OK to terminate the program.</i><br><br><br>I then click the OK button of this dialogue, but my un-installer works just fine after that.<br><br>I have several other un-installers I have created in the same folder, and they all work without giving me an error.<br><br>I then try an older version of this file, because I have never seen this error before, so I'm thinking that if I get the same error with the old file, it will probably be something wrong with the hard drive. And sure enough; when I have installed the old version, and try to use the un-installer, I get the same error.<br><br>BUT - I then create a test folder on the Desktop, and install it to that folder. But even <i>there</i> I get the same error when trying to use the un-installer.<br><br><br>So I was wondering if there is a known problem that could cause this? Too long name, too long sentences in the un-installer, etc.? I guess it could be my hardware, but it's weird that it's just this file, and that it gives the error no matter where I install it.<br><br>And also that the same error is also in the old file, as I have never gotten this error before, and I'm almost 100% positive that I've tested the un-installer back then.<br><br>Again - the <b>installer</b> part works without errors. It's only the un-installer that opens with a 'bang', so to speak...<br><br>Any clues? I'm looking for something you know could cause this, 'cause I'm reluctant to post the script here.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th August 2005 14:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I'm not 100% sure on this but that error message is a "memory leak".

This is a crash in one of the DLLs loaded by the installer. It might be a standard Windows DLL, or a DLL you unregister in the uninstallation process.
