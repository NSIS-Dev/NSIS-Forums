      <p class="post-content"><strong>ExecWait with progress bar ?</strong><br />
      &nbsp; hi!<br />
      <br />
      here is my problem.<br />
      <br />
      for compression i use WinRar. to extract i use ExecWait to call UnRar.exe (for decompression). my question : it is possible to display the progress bar (from the inst_files page) while execwait is executing ?<br />
      ex. when execwait begins the progress bar is at 0%. when it finishes the progress bar jumpes to 34%. is it possible to show the progress beetween this points, not only the begining and the end ?<br />
      <br />
      thanks.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      do not respond yet. sorry. let me read a little documentation...</p>

      <p class="post-content">well it's a little strange. if i extract with winrar or make the arhive SFX (.exe) it stoppes and askes for the second volume, but the producers tool, freeware - unrar.exe, does not support this. interesting...<br />
      <br />
      so the question remains. but not for this particular case.<br />
      can it be done ?<br />
      <br />
      thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think an execwait with progress bar can be done because NSIS has no way to know how is the launched program doing.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe if you uncompress with NSIS built-in zip will show a real progrees bar, but you may be using rar because of space...</p>

      <p class="post-content">you are right. i'm using rar compression instead of zip because is better. too bad...<br />
      <br />
      back to zip then...<br />
      new question: i searched the forums and did not find any related threads, if my project is about 4 cd-s, can i make (using install options, custom pages, or something like this) the installer to stop when done copying from the cd and ask, with a nice combo box, for the next cd ? or something like this ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you are using anything other than the File command then you can. Just copy everything that you need using unrar, CopyFiles, or anything else and then ask for the next CD and start copying from it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">TIP: use RAR with parameters instead unrar.<br />
      Unrar sucks although is has same routines as rar - you dont need a keyfile if you do not use proprietare switches like auth or so. the only thing is (if distributed) a copyright file &amp; text for RAR.<br />
      <br />
      BTW there exist an unrar.dll (eg. will be distributed with Winace) - maybe you can find out how to use it to get a feedback in NSIS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">in the end i used unrar.exe. it's ok, it works. i used nsExec.<br />
      <br />
      but now i have another problem:<br />
      <br />
      my script is mothing like this:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>.......
<br />!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES
<br />Page custom CD02 ValidateCD
<br />&gt;!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES
<br />Page custom CD03 ValidateCD
<br />&gt;!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES
<br />&gt;....... 
</code>
</pre>in the first instfiles page i'm installing the first cd. with the first custom function i ask the user to enter the 2nd cd and i install it with the second instfiles page and so on...<br />
      <br />
      my problem is: how to make my scipt to recognize that the first (or second) cd has already been installed ? because every time i use instfiles it starts from the begining (decompressing files).

      <p class="post-content">i forgot to say that i have 2 sections, but the first section containes the 3cd installation.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You'd need to start changing sections' flags at each section. In the first section that installs the first CD change the flags of all sections so that only the second one will be installed next, etc.</p>
