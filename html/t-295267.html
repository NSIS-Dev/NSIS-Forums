Only one/two AV engines out of 33 detected malware. Those are false positives, no doubt. Most likely broken heuristics once gain. If you UPX your file, you'll easily get even more hits. Also my comment was about own personal experiences: I release software using NSIS installers and I get bombed with "Ahhh, there is Virus in your software !!!" mails all the time. I already put a fat warning on the web-site, telling people that they should refer to VirusTotal before sending virus reports, but it seems most people just panic when their anti-virus software detects "Gerneric.Packed" or alike. Unfortunately A/V software developers seem to don't care much about false positives, as long as the affected program is not "big" commercial software...</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">stopasking</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">1st August 2008 11:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>The result clearly shows that your file is clean.

Anitivir still claims that a small tool, which I have written myself, is Malware! All this tool does is shutdown my PC and I wrote it for personal usage. Never ever released it. But still I get a Virus popup each time I run my tool. Another observation: Many (but not all) Anti-Virus softwares have strong prejudices against "packed" executable (UPX or Upack), although packing executables is 100% legitimate. Really bizarre...</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
