      <p class="post-content"><strong>Reading Batch Exit Codes</strong><br />
      Hello all,<br />
      <br />
      I was having some problems with processes plugins and Vista so I decided I would write my own batch script to see if a a process is running. The batch script works fine and returns a different error level / exit code (by EXIT /B ###) depending on whether the process is found or not. All the NSIS documentation and google searches I have seen say ExecWait should be able to read the exit code. But it either always reads 0 or an empty variable. Does anybody have any ideas? I don't really want to use a plugin if I don't have to but if I do, anybody know a good one that will work with XP and Vista?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just a comment about "I don't really want to use a plugin if I don't have to but if I do", NSIS is really suffering from lack of documentation and maintenance, and a lot of interesting stuff (means up-to-date and the ones to use) are now developped in plugins...<br />
      <br />
      As for your problem, I am using nsExec:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        Return Value<br />
        ------------<br />
        If nsExec is unable to execute the process, it will return "error"<br />
        on the top of the stack, if the process timed out it will return<br />
        "timeout", else it will return the return code from the<br />
        executed process.

      <p class="post-content">I really didn't want to make it seem that I was anti-plugins, I have just had some problems with some of them and Vista and wanted to try to avoid having more. If there is a plugin out there that will work for me with a minimal chance of problems I will be happy to use it.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the suggestion about nsExec, but sadly it didn't work for me. It always returns 0 for me. Any other ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Execute the command line application (command.com on 9x and cmd.exe on NT, or just %COMSPEC% on all) and tell it to execute your batch file. It should return the correct value.</p>
      <pre>
<code>ReadEnvStr $0 COMSPEC<br />ExecWait '"$0" /c blah.bat' $0</code>

      <p class="post-content">Unfortunately, kichik, your ReadEnvStr didn't work for me either, it always read 1 so it was at least a new result.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't use /B as you want it to exit CMD.EXE and set its return value and not the batch's.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice suggestion kichik, I removed the /B and then I could read the exit code (just with ExecWait) on Windows XP. However it still gives me problems in Vista. Anyone have ideas that will make Vista happy?</p>
