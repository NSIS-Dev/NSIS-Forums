      <p class="post-content">One more thought...<br />
      Is it possible that you have placed an Abort in the middle of a section? If yes this could cause the installer not to end properly. Examine the example below to see what I mean.<br />
      <br />
      outfile test.exe<br />
      licensedata '${NSISDIR}\license.txt'<br />
      <br />
      page license<br />
      page instfiles<br />
      <br />
      section -<br />
      messagebox mb_yesno 'Continue?' idyes +2<br />
      abort<br />
      sleep 2000<br />
      messagebox mb_ok 'end of section dude!'<br />
      sectionend</p>

      <p class="post-content">i have only one "abort"<br />

      <blockquote>

        !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE ChangeSubtitleFont<br />
        Page Custom WelcomePage ; this is custom page, because standard welcome page does not work correctly<br />
        !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_SHOW Redraw<br />
        ;!define MUI_LICENSEPAGE_CHECKBOX ; you can use it, if you want, radiobuttons too<br />
        !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE $(LicenseString)
      </blockquote>i have try with " SetPluginUnload alwaysoff " at the end of my script page , but always the same pb.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sorry, I can't think of something furthermore. I have not any idea about those plugins that you're using in your script, thus I can't imagine how they act. Must exists documentation and examples included with the plugins that might help you catch the bug.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Obviously the conclusion is that there is a running proccess on your 1st pc that is responsible for the conflict. You have to identify that proccess (perhaps an AV or something like this) beacause it is possible that when you spread out your game, others would have the same problem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">BGGradient appears as a second proccess in windows task manager, though, it does not prevent the installer to close normally.</p>
