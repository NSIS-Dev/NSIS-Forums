      I tried 9, my issue must've been with the IntFmt using the 0x also instead of just the byte I read. OH well. I'm going to tinker some more, I have to convert bytes some more still. This is a huge help! :D thanks!

      <p class="post-content">Wow...I'm not getting anywhere again, pulling my hair out.<br>
      <br>
      I've attached my current .tree file.<br>
      <br>
      Here's the code I'm using (explanation to follow):<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>                FileOpen $0 "$PROFILEDIRECTORY\fstrees\$TREEFILE" a<br>                FileSeek $0 9 SET<br>                FileReadByte $0 $1<br>                FileSeek $0 10 SET<br>                FileReadByte $0 $7<br>                IntFmt $2 "%C" "$1"<br>                ${StrStrip} ":" $CURRENTDRIVE $3<br>          ${CharToASCII} $4 $3<br>          IntFmt $5 "%lX" "$4"<br>          FileSeek $0 9 SET<br>          FileWriteByte $0 $5<br>          FileSeek $0 9 SET<br>          FileReadByte $0 $6<br>          FileSeek $0 1 SET<br>          FileReadByte $0 $8<br>                Messagebox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION `$1 -- $2 -- $3 -- $4 -- $5 -- $6 -- $7 -- $8`</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Now, in here I'm trying to read the "F" and change it to a new letter, in my testing I was aiming for J.<br>
      <br>
      I've added the Messagebox to show the variables (self-explanatory now), for debugging. What seems to be happening, is it reads the F fine, formats it to a character beautifully, and then it reads the currentdrive, J, encodes it correctly to the hex equivalent (4A), as shown by $5, but then when I read the Byte again, it only reads as "4" as shown by $6. $7 and $8 also both read as zero. When I look at the file again, the previous drive letter "F" was replaced with EOT, whose hex equivalent is "4". So it seems that only one byte is being written, not both??<br>
      <br>
      I have to recode the $4 back to hex because that's how the file is stored, hence the IntFmt to create $5. Which, I checked, is the right hex value.<br>
      <br>
      Do I have to just split and write the bytes separately?? I'm just kinda lost on why it's not working.<br>
      <br>
      Don't worry, I plan on cleaning up the reads and whatnot after I get this debugged, I'm just trying to figure it out.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks AGAIN. (I'm a pain, I know).

      <p class="post-content">FileWriteByte writes a SINGLE byte to the file. ASCII characters fit into a SINGLE byte so to change the letter 'F' to the letter 'J' all you need to do is change a SINGLE byte.<br>
      <br>
      Look again at the last code fragment I supplied. When I tested it the code was able to change the 'T' in your sample data to a 'Z'.<br>
      <br>
      There is no need to do the hex conversion; notice that my code does NOT use IntFmt to convert the result from CharToASCII.<br>
      <br>
      In my code the result from CharToASCII is written directly to the file. ASCII characters fit into a single byte so there is no need to do anything to the result before FileWriteByte is used to save the result in the file.<br>
      <br>
      FileWriteByte only writes a single byte to the file (i.e. it writes a value between 0 and 255 or, if you prefer to think in hex, between 0x00 and 0xFF). If you supply a value that is too big to fit into a single byte, FileWriteByte will only write the bottom 8 bits, e.g. supply 256 and it will write 0 into the file.</p>
