      <p class="post-content"><strong>help system is better but cumbersome to search ?</strong><br />
      I was really glad that the help was divided into smaller sections :) ...it makes the loading of the pages much faster. Also a lot of work has been into it ! :up:<br />
      <br />
      There is a bit of a problem though...searching for an instruction has become a bit difficult. :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Previously I had to run "makensis.htm", press Ctrl+F, type in the instruction name, and the help was there.<br />
      <br />
      I really appreciate and like the new method so I have a suggestion...<br />
      could you write the names of all the instructions that are in the section (on the main page) below the type of the instruction<br />
      e.g.<br />
      Installer Attributes (or whatever)<br />
      (Name, Caption, etc)<br />
      <br />
      What this will do is that the users starts the main page, searches for whatever word he wants (which brings him near the link of the subsequent page), and so on...As of now, the user has to first think about the type of the instruction he is searching for and then if it is correct, he gets it, otherwise :mad:<br />
