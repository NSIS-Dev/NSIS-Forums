When I run it, it copies itself to "$TEMP\~nsu.tmp\Au_.exe", run it and exit itself. By doing so it allows the removal of the "official" uninstaller executable.<br><br>I noticed that the "$TEMP\~nsu.tmp\Au_.exe" file is only removed after reboot. However the "$TEMP\~nsu.tmp" directory is not removed. Is it normal ? I guess it shouldn't be too annoying to stay with an empty temp directory but it would be much cleaner to delete it.<br><br>Any idea / remarks about this ?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sebastien</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th February 2007 09:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">This is the way that uninstaller is programed to operate, not a big deal I guess leaving an empty dir into $TEMP.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sebarnolds</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th February 2007 09:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yeah, but it would be cleaner if the uninstaller copied itself to something like "$TEMP\$name.exe" instead of in a directory of his own... where $name is the result of a call to GetTempFileName.
