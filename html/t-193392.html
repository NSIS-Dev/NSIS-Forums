      <p class="post-content"><strong>How can I easily delete all files created by the installer?</strong><br />
      Upon hearing a horror story of a user that accidentally installed his shareware application in the root of the hard disk, only to have the uninstaller "RMDir /r" his entire hard disk I decided I don't want to use the /r option anymore.<br />
      <br />
      Am I forced to manually delete each and every single file I create manually with a "Delete" command or is there some easy way to have the uninstaller delete all the files that were created during the installation, but none of the other files it finds?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks and best regards,<br />
      Diodor Bitan</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why did you use AllowRootDirInstall true? If you don't use that, the user won't be able to install to the root directory.<br />
      <br />
      You can also use a macro which both includes a file and writes its delete line to another file. You can then include that file in the uninstaller to have all the files copied deleted.<br />
      <br />
      !macro File file<br />
      File "${file}"<br />
      !system 'echo Delete "$INSTDIR\${file}" &gt;&gt; $%TEMP%\uninstaller.nsh'<br />
      !macroend<br />
      <br />
      Section uninstall<br />
      !include $%TEMP%\uninstaller.nsh<br />
      SectionEnd</p>

      </blockquote>I'm glad to hear that. The horror story wasn't about my app, so then it seems I was safe in this regard. I still don't want to use either of "RMDir /r" or "Delete *.*" anymore<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>That's nice! I still have to enter a separate line for each file in the application directory, right?<br />
      <br />
      I wanted to automate this somehow - right now my script adds files with File 'C:\path\*.*' commands, which is quite convenient as the files change from version to version.<br />
      <br />
      I guess I'll have to make an external script that scans all the files in the directory and creates files that will therafter be included in my nsis script.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks to your help I'll be able to call the external script from the nsis one using the !system command, so that should be the end of that :)

      <p class="post-content">Done!<br />
      <br />
      I add the files with an elegant "File /r c:\*.*" in my installing section. Then in the uninstall section, I add<br />
      <br />
      !system "delsave.bat"<br />
      !include "delsave.nsh"<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The delsave.bat program:<br />
      <br />
      dir /s /b /a-d c:\pax\*.* &gt; temp.txt<br />
      lua -e "io.input ('temp.txt') io.output ('delsave.nsh') dir = 'c:\\pax'" -l delsave.lua<br />
      del temp.txt<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Which in turns calls the delsave.lua program:<br />
      <br />
      len = string.len (dir)<br />
      <br />
      for line in io.lines () do<br />
      assert (dir == string.sub (line, 1, len))<br />
      io.write ('Delete "$INSTDIR', string.sub (line, len + 1), '"\n')<br />
      end<br />
      <br />
