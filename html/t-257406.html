      Hi,<br />
      I am still not to understand clearly about NullSoft. When I read help file. I can not see why +2 or +3 except (+1 or +0) :(<br />
      I also find information about it but I still can not.<br />
      StrCmp $0 "a string" 0 +3<br />
      DetailPrint '$$0 == "a string"'<br />
      Goto +2<br />
      DetailPrint '$$0 != "a string"'<br />
      Someone can help me???<br />

      <p class="post-content">What is your problem? I don't clearly understand you. Do you need more information about jumping to labels or what? What is wrong with +1, +0, +2, +3.<br />
      <br />
      If you need advice in conditional logic, have a look at LogicLib.nsh and the examples in the NSIS/Examples directory - LogicLib.nsi. It is more clear to beginners.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You mean relative jupms? :confused: It's all in the NSIS Manual (4.4 Relative Jumps) read also (4.3 Labels) I personally like to use labels instead of relative jumps, but it's not always possible.<br />
      <br />
      Basically the +integer or -integer tells the program to jump on instruction relative to the place they are called from.<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>StrCmp $0 "a string" 0 +3 ; if register $0 == "a string" jump to 0 (continue normally) <br />else jump to the third instruction from this point (skip the DetailPrint and Goto below).<br /><br />DetailPrint '$$0 == "a string"' ; if the jump was 0 the code will continue normally here.<br /><br />Goto +2 ; jump to second instruction from this point (skip the DetailPrint)<br /><br />DetailPrint '$$0 != "a string"' ; if the jump was +3 the code will continue from this point</code>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks,<br />
      My problem is not to understand clearly many command on NSIS. Sometimes, I read on help file, I can not find it out.<br />
      I want to find another example which it is more clearly to study it.<br />
      So, I want to ask everybody to have more documents.<br />
      Once again, thank you</p>

      <p class="post-content">search for files with nsi extension in your NSIS installation directories and you will find tons of examples. They are grouped to a certain topic or subject. If you read just some of them you will understand a lot.<br />
      <br />
      Nobody can help you understanding NSIS, unless you have some experience. Compile examples, see what they are doing and look in the code.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck!</p>
