In my install script I map a drive to another server (this causes no problem) and then I try to extract a file to this drive and it doesn't work. However if the map to the drive was already created before running the installer I can extract the file. How could I avoid this? thanxs.<br><br>cheers,<br>alej</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Takhir</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2004 18:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I had the same problems with Windows Remote Terminal service - hardware configuration updates appears after re-login only.

Run any Windows utility, working with file server - dir f:\ (new drive letter from "net" parameters) or fc, "more f:\file" :) and check up this way valid drive letter (f:\ for example)<br>BTW, most of Win programs work fine directly with network path (I had one problem long ago, but I cannot remember what it was .. )<br><br>E:\Documents and Settings\takhir&gt;copy \\bar\takhir\install.sh .<br>1 file(s) copied.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">almoes</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th June 2004 11:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I made alot of tests and the drive is mapped.
