      <p class="post-content"><strong>Problem with Delete</strong><br />
      I am trying to backup some files that my install clobbers, and then restore them on uninstall. In the main section (where all the files are added) I do a bunch of:<br />
      <br />
      CopyFiles "$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil" "$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil.bak"<br />
      <br />
      In the Uninstall section, I do a bunch of:<br />
      <br />
      CopyFiles "$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil.bak" "$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil"<br />
      ..<br />
      ..<br />
      <br />
      followed by:<br />
      <br />
      Delete "$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil.bak"<br />
      ..<br />
      ..<br />
      <br />
      After the install is done, the .bak files are all still there. The copies work, but the Deletes fail, even though the Deletes that uninstall the installed files work fine.<br />
      <br />
      I tried putting "sleep 5000" between the copies and the deletes. I tried moving the deletes to the un.onUninstSuccess function. No luck.<br />
      <br />
      Is this a known issue? Something silly I may be doing? I am using NSIS 2.46 on WinXP Pro.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I was using the Unix style path separator. Old habits die hard. That seems to have fixed it. Odd that they work with CopyFiles, but not with Delete. I moved to the "copy-&gt;delete" model after Rename failed. Maybe that was the slashes too and it will work now.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for catching that. It was something silly I was doing after all.<br />
