Everything works great after some days. Good piece of software!<br><br>I use the file time of the installed files as a hint for the version of the software:<br>e.g. files of V 2.05.27 get a filetime of 05:27 So in case of service the version can easily be seen. The date is set to the release date of the software.<br><br>The way i do it: Copy all files in the target folder and then build the installer, in which i execute filetime.exe, a simple command line tool to set the desired timestamp. At that point it's all ok, the files get the desired time stamp and it is also unchanged after building the installer - as it is supposed to.<br><br>But:<br>Finally the installed files have a timestamp of e.g. 04:27 instead of 05:27. Seems to be something around daylight time...<br><br><br>For the last 10 years i've used an old version of Install Shield without having this timestamp problem. There i also have set the time stamp with filetime.exe<br><br><u>Any idea how to keep the time stamp of the installed files untouched?</u><br><br>Did not find anything in the users manual and not here in the forum.<br><br>Regards, jenserl<br><br><br>PS: The OS is WinXP</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jenserl</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th July 2013 11:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Wow, no one any idea... ?<br><br>:confused: ooops...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">demiller9</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th July 2013 12:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You could include filetime.exe in the installer and set the timestamp after the files have been extracted on the final system.<br><br>But the timestamp will still vary by an hour when the system switches to/from daylight time.

But with all the Exec... Commands i could not get datetime.exe to work. It seemed to run without error but did not change anything. Seems i still do basic things wrong... :-( Tried it in section "install" after the File commands, tried it in .onInstSuccess - nothing happened.<br><br>@aerDNA<br>Anyway, this helped. Thank you very much, it brought the solution. File datetime changing now as desired.<br><br><br>But, demiller9, you are right :up:, depending on daylight time, the displayed filetime is adjusted. Either i really did not have to use this little helper or it just happened that daylight time was correct everytime we looked at the files :-) :rolleyes:<br><br>OK, that all brought me a bit deeper into NSIS and i learned a lot about the way to do things. Even therefore i thank you all very much for your help.<br><br>So lets close this thread now.

And you're not going to since you're working with local time. UTC you'd have to get programmatically, which defeats your purpose.

But it's behaving the same now as with the 8 years old solution before. And i think i can live with that also the next 8 years... :D<br><br>As i wrote above, it's only a little helper and rarely used, because...<br>- as long as the application is running, the version is shown in the title line. So, no problem.<br>- if not and a service guy is around, he knows to look up the version in the properties. So, no problem also.<br>- Only if it happens that i've to talk with a machine operator (their main knowledge is how to use hammer and wrench...:)) AND the app refusing to run, it's good to have a simple way to find out about the version. Next, the files' date is set to the release date of the version, at least looking up the release date in my documents shows the correct version. Mostly its enough already to see that all the application's files have same version and are not mangled by some creative users. For that, even a time shifted timestamp is ok, as long as all files have the same...<br><br>The way it was and is now will fit the requirements...<br><br>But back to your suggestion with UTC:<br>Did you mean to set the PC's time to UTC and disable DST switching? Or setting the file time as UTC time? I i've tried the second with the Time plugin, but of course with DST change also the displayed file time changed - as expected...<br><br>Well, a new installer was on my ToDo list for longer time already. Since there was a delay in the mechanic part of the current project, i've found enough time now to do this. The new installer now is doing what is expected: Its installing an application... :up: :-) For me, the rest is more or less "a little cosmetic" problem. And that all suits my needs now...<br><br>Best regards and thank you for your help,<br>Jenserl</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
