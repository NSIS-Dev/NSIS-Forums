      Hi<br />
      <br />
      On the makensisw.exe app - could you add under the "File menu item" the last 5 scripts you loaded into the compiler!<br />
      <br />
      I work on a number of scripts and would cool to just select the last one I was working with ;-)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks, and hope you have a good holiday!<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />/X"SetCompressor bzip2" "C:\test files\file.nsi<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />

      <br />
      Also, there should be a way to clear the MRU list. And files that no longer exist should be removed if you try to run it (and the file doesn't exist).

      <p class="post-content">Works much better now. My only issue now is that it doesn't remember my compressor settings (or any /X parameters passed really). For certain installers, I have to use bzip2, so the MRU doesn't work since NSIS defaults to zlib.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Remembering compressor settings was a feature request that has been shelved for now.<br />
      The basic support for this feature is already there in the GUI, but it is waiting on a compressor command line option in makensis.<br />
      Using /X"SetCompressor foo" will work most of the time, but if you explicitly set the compressor in your script, it will override the command line option.<br />
      If you know which installers need bzip2, why not add the SetCompressor bzip2 command directly to the scripts?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The new MRU feature does not work on my Win98SE system. I am using MAKENSISW.EXE v1.102 from a snapshot downloaded yesterday (21 August). After editing several files, the MRU list remains empty (see screenshot). I have exited and rerun the program but it never shows any MRU entries.<br />
      <br />
      When I looked at the registry, I found some MRU data in HKLM\Software\NSIS\MRU (entries 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 had the expected data).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I finally had to setup VirtualPC with a Windows 98 SE VM to be able to test this. It turns out that MS Windows 9x handles the WM_MENUSELECT message differently from MS Windows NT/2000/XP.<br />
      (Why am I not surprised? Its Micro$oft after all).<br />
      So I had to overhaul quite a bit of code to get it working.<br />
      Anyway, the latest CVS version should now work with Windows 9x as well as Windows NT/2000/XP.<br />
      As always, please let me know if you find bugs in the implementation.</p>
