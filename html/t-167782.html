      <p class="post-content"><strong>StrCmp vs IntCmp</strong><br />
      I just had a shortage of bits when some numbers I have in a script grew beyond 4G. I were not doing any arithemetic on them, only comparing them so I thought it would be easy just to switch to strings.<br />
      <br />
      But IntCmp(U) is:<br />
      <br />
      val1 val2 jump_if_equal [jump_if_val1_less] [jump_if_val1_more]<br />
      <br />
      and StrCmp is:<br />
      <br />
      str1 str2 jump_if_equal [jump_if_not_equal]<br />
      <br />
      and of course it was less than and more than comparisons I were doing.<br />
      <br />
      I can't find anything in the current implementation that explains why this rather odd limitation is there (lstrcmpi works like any C strcmp AFAIK) and the<br />
      "best" solution IMO would be to change StrCmp to work the<br />
      way IntCmp works with the obvious exception of that breaking most scripts existing today.<br />
      <br />
      So lacking the "perfect" solution have anyone else already created an StrCmpX macro/function that works like this? (I could not find anything in the list archives or "The Archives")</p>

      The Math plugin also happily does just the string comparison I was looking for.<br />
      <br />
      So for future searchers in this forum: strcmp, less than, greater than, math, plugin.</p>
