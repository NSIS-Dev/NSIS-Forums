      <p class="post-content"><strong>Frustrating problem with uninstaller</strong><br />
      Im trying to make so only the installed files gets uninstalled.<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Uninstall_only_installed_files" target="_blank">CODE</a><br />
      But something makes the uninstaller freeze then only one file is left. The uninstall.log.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/779/uninstallerproblemqo2.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a image that shows were the uninstallers stops/freeze.<br />
      Its show that its trying to remove fgd/counter-strike but that folder is removed. The only file left is uninstall.log.<br />
      <br />
      And <a href="http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/9068/notuninstalledmw6.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> are a image of the only file left. (in the red circle). Files with a balck line over are not going to be uninstalled.<br />
      I took this screen after I had stoped the uninstaller by CTRL+ALT+DEL.<br />
      <br />
      I have two ideas why it doesent work but I dont know how to solve it.<br />
      <br />
      1. The uninstall.log is in use by the uninstaller so it cant delete it<br />
      <br />
      2. The code for the uninstaller just loop and loop and never stops.<br />
      <br />
      And I dont think it has something to do with that the uninstaller copy its self to temp. And the installdir sems to be right.<br />
      <br />
      So what can be wrong with the code?<br />
      <br />
      I have attached the nsi so you can take a look at it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Just looking at your code, I think you are getting into an endless loop at the very end just before you delete the log file.<br />
      <br />
      Just swap the last 2 lines so that this:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>StrCmp $R1 0 LoopDone<br />IntOp $R1 $R1 - 1</code>
</pre><br />
      becomes this:
      <pre>
<code>IntOp $R1 $R1 - 1<br />StrCmp $R1 0 LoopDone</code>
</pre>.<br />
      <br />
      The original problem happens when $R1 gets assinged a value of zero and then starts the loop again. When $R1 is zero, $R2 will never be able to equal $R1 and therefore you get into an endless loop. By checking the value of $R1 AFTER you change it's value, you can exit the loop at the proper time.
