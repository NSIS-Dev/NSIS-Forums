I am starting to see what you are saying and what I am doing wrong and why I did not understand. I was using the traditional Page license to display my license ReadMe.txt and I was using MUI_PAGE_LICENSE to display my informational ReadMe2.txt. I was using LicenseForceSelection radiobuttons in the Page license and this was causing the radio buttons to be displayed in MUI_PAGE_LICENSE page. I tried to use !undef MUI_LICENSEPAGE_RADIOBUTTONS to get rid of the radio buttons, but the compiler complained that MUI_LICENSEPAGE_RADIOBUTTONS was not defined.<br><br>I think I have resolved this by doing what was intended by using 2 MUI_PAGE_LICENSE pages.<br><br>My question now is now do I get rid of the line that says â€œLicense Agreement Please review theâ€¦â€ that is at the top of the license page? I want this displayed on my first license page, but not on the second. (because the second page I am not using as a license page) I see that I can change the MUI_LICENSEPAGE_TEXT_BOTTOM, but this will not affect this License Agreement line. I tried to redefine MUI_TEXT_LICENSE_TITLE, but that did not have an affect. I know you are suppose to be able to change this line, but how?<br><br>Thank you for your help.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Filus</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th November 2006 18:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Excuse me, but if this is only informational text, why you don't try to use custom page with textbox and read content of this file into it?
