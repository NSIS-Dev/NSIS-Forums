</pre><br>
      <br>
      But the 'ExecShell "open" "program.exe"' doesnt fit for me. I need that a regstring is written. What to do?<br>

      <p class="post-content">there's no point in using ExecShell with an executable. try Exec or nsExec.<br>

      for registry manipulation, check the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.9.2" target="_blank">manual</a></p>

      <br>
      Flags=GROUP<br>

      <b>NOTE:</b> Every time you put that line at any radiobutton "field", that control starts a new group of radiobuttons.</p>
