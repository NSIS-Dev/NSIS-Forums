      <p class="post-content">Sorry, I'm really trying to understand this. Its a far cry from the OOP I'm used to...<br>
      <br>
      So my first guess at what you mean is Essential files is missing the skip line at the end of the section. This is because Essential Files are required no matter what in the installer. But do I still need a skip?<br>
      <br>
      As for the second part, I'm not sure what you're saying. Do I need to make that part look like you typed it? Literally throwing that message box line after the Exch line? I need more specifics, but thank you so much still for being helpful.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Invalid Opcode usually means stack corruption. You're pushing or popping (or exch'ing) values incorrectly. This is what T.Slappy meant, the Exch commands in your ReplaceLineStr function aren't correct.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, well that tells me nothing unfortunately. I pretty much inherited this project so it isn't like I've been working with this stuff for long. I frankly have not the slightest clue what this function is supposed to do, which is probably why I don't even see the error to begin with. Its weird that this should pop up though. Perhaps I received a slightly outdated version of the source used because the previous released installer works fine. Regardless, I'm really new to this, I need slightly less technical explanations.<br>
      <br>
      According to <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Replace_line_that_starts_with_specified_string" target="_blank">this</a>, that function is fine.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ConfigRead" target="_blank">This</a> is the other major function with stacking. The version there has two differences from mine:<br>
      <br>
      Example:<br>
      <br>
      IfErrors error<br>
      ...<br>
      <br>
      StrCpy $0 ''<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Mine:<br>
      <br>
      IfErrors empty<br>
      ...<br>
      empty:<br>
      StrCpy $0 ''<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Does it matter? Also, should the functions be defined at the begging of my script to work properly? And also someone please tell me if the Skip label is needed for the non-optional essential files and why.</p>

      If you had done a single search through your sourcecode, looking for 'ReplaceLineStr', you would have found that the code calls the function four times, but does it once without pushing the variables to the stack first. Obviously, you cannot 'Exch $R0' from the stack if the stack doesn't contain anything.

      <p class="post-content">Oh how did that get there? Gosh I feel stupid. Plus HMNSIS' search function doesn't work, so that's another thing I figured out. I get it though, its like having an accessed none, its just the odd order and syntax that throws me. See, I'm used to calling functions at the same time as defining the input variables, for example DoThis(var1, var2). Now, being unfamiliar with this code, I need to determine if that first call extraneous or not. I don't see a reason for it to be there, but I want to be sure I didn't maybe accidentally remove the variables or some other equally dumb mistake.<br>
      <br>
      You know, the older version doesn't have that line, how it got there I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure I get this a lot better now. From what you've said about the error itself it really does sound like this is the problem. If this works it will be a relief, I thought I was going to have to spend weeks troubleshooting it. Funny how I can be so proficient with OOP based languages but this stuff just throws me through a loop. But thanks for being patient with me guys.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Shoot, one last problem. I re-compiled this on a Windows 7 32 bit OS and if I try to take it over to my XP computer it fails the integrity check and has no icon, just shows up as the default exe icon. What's going on?</p>

      <p class="post-content">If the integrity check fails, the file probably isn't integral anymore. If you want to check manually, you could of course do a manual CRC or MD5 check on the file. But most probably you didn't copy the file correctly.</p>
