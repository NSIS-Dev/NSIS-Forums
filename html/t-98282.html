      The form that my archive site is in was only intended as a quick test - it really needs replacing by some dedicated php code. I want to do this but I think it would be good to find out what people think the archive should look like, how the content should be structured/organised, what facilities it should offer etc etc.<br />
      <br />
      For example at the moment it doesn't have the ability to upload stuff, the versioning is all done by hand, the search won't search inside NSIS script files, the search dumps out Wiki script when it should only dump out page content, the logins are crap, and there should be a means of anonymously commenting on archived items, and so on.<br />
      <br />
      Are their any sites out there that collect information together in a way that people really like that maybe I could model the site on? All suggestions are welcome.<br />
      <br />
      I don't expect to have time to implement any of this just yet but in a couple of weeks I should start having more free time so work might start then.</p>
