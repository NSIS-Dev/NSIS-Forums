This isn't much of a problem with small files but often on larger transfers a long-lived connection may be reset by an intervening router or proxy and firewall or antivirus software.<br><br>Once you get files that are greater than a gigabyte, you will go looking for a more robust downloading solution. I examined InetLoad but it seems a little buggy and is in development. NSISdl does nearly everything I wanted so I decided that I should try adding the resume feature to retry failed transfers.<br><br>CHANGES<br>Instead of immediately failing from a timeout, dropped connection, or bad server response the new code attempts to reestablish the download where it left off (up to "/RETRIES=" times.)<br><br>All of the changes except one are in the nsisdl.cpp file's download function. The only change outside of that file is to allow a response code of 206 (Partial Content) in httpget.cpp.<br><br>The code seems to work fine for me but I would love to get people to test it. I whipped up a quick downloader to fetch the latest OpenOffice and pulled the plug on my router several times during the transfer as a test. The download completed perfectly and the file was not corrupt.<br><br>NOTES<br>The code is ugly, the orginal NSISdl.cpp was in bad need of refactoring (any takers? hah!) and my additions make the problem even more obvious. The huge download function desperately needs to be broken up into more manageable pieces but I was more concerned last night with getting the code working order than fixing a pretty ugly function.<br><br>Attachment contains source code(only the two modified files), precompiled nsisdl.DLL (compiled for size), and an example OpenOffice downloader .nsi script.<br><br>Jon</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ImBcmDth</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th August 2007 03:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">How do code fixes get added to the CVS?

Last year I don't see any problems with InetLoad (might be fixed, or may be because inetc is now in use).<br>I left InetLoad "as it is" making critical updates only because too many people use it. Inetc is much better, it not uses NSISdl embeded progress bar :) that caused crashes (embedded borderless child dialog with cancel button appears now), it is stable and "under improvement" ("under development" sounds like "not finished" :) ), new features appear ... if requested and look reasonable :).<br>IMHO NSISdl is good in simple environment (no proxy, for example), on Win95 Gold (no IE) and if you want learn how all these network/http tricks can be implemented in C code. But for buseness applications I vote for WinInet base of inetload/inetc. Just because it was tested billions of times. And it supports a lot of add-ons, for example, I had request for redirections, but found that this was already implemented by MS in WinInet, so it works already.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ImBcmDth</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th August 2007 12:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I didn't mean any disrespect when I referred to Inet* as <i>in development</i> Takhir. :D You are right though, a better term would be <i>under improvement</i>.

I wanted to have a direct replacement for users who didn't have the time or knowledge to change their install scripts over to Inet*.<br><br>This way they can simply recompile their install script (if my changes ever makes it to the official release) and *poof* they would have a downloader that doesn't panic when the connection is reset for a variety of reasons.

The baseline NSIS has to work on as many Microsoft operating systems as possible. How can you tell someone they can't install My_Great_Utility on an '95 computer?

      Hey Takhir, I looked at adding chunked transfer decoding to NSISdl.

If so, then how do you handle the progress bar during (large) chunked downloads?<br>

      </blockquote>"success" and "cancel" are strings passed to the script. Having those translated will make it harder to tell when the download failed for scripts.

      </blockquote>Progress bar remains empty for chunked http reply or if ftp server not supports SIZE command. Not good, but you can display something like "unavailable" or "unknown" in the status string. We should do what we can, but good server is installer developer's responsibility.

      Hey man, I would like to thank you. I have no idea about what you did to bring me this working version of the nsisdl plugin ;) , but all I know - that is all I need to know - is my nsis packet is perfect now.<br>
      I had problems trying to download a php page with the original plugin, and successfully tried your nsisdl which could handle that page without any problem, and noticed no problem with the cpu utilization.<br>
      Thank you again!<br>
