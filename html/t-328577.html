      <p class="post-content">There has to be more filemon output than just the prefetch line, your filter could be wrong, try just *. But, I'm guessing your problem is actually the quotes, just use RMDir /R "c:\path", you don't need to pack the double quotes in single quotes...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Anders, you are king. You were right in both:<br>
      <br>
      1. The single quotes posed a problem (I tried without them before, but being confused I panicked, added them and forgot to removed them).<br>
      <br>
      2. The FileMon filter that I specified didn't take into account the truncation of the process name and so it filtered too much.<br>
      <br>
      It turns out that there was a process running in that folder that I was trying to delete. The nsExec version succeeded because I took care of existing the process beforehand. Once I did the same for NSIS's RmDir <i>and</i> used only one set of quotes, the operation succeeded.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you Anders!</p>

      <p class="post-content">For future reference, when you execute something you should pack the whole command line in single quotes with the application (and any other path that can contain spaces in double quotes): '"c:\some path\myapp.exe" /param' and you do this because of the "c:\Program.exe" vs "c:\Program Files\foo.exe" problem (Get this wrong and "c:\Program.exe" gets executed with "Files\foo.exe" as its parameter, this is also a security problem)<br>
      <br>
      Instructions that only take a single path don't have this problem...</p>
