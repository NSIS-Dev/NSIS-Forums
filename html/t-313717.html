I quickly found 5 and more. I have seen this question over and over on the forum. There is always a quick reply of the guys that make this forum that smart and useful.<br><br>What is missing is a community rating for those plugins. Especially newbies would really appreciate this if they could just choose a version that has been rated in the last months by a couple of developers. That would decrease the possibility that newbies choose older plugins that in fact do the job in the first place but have much better successor plugins that are kept uptodate with newer Windows Versions.<br><br>Especially for the process-plugins it is not quite clear, that they can handle x64 versions or even Vista.<br><br>code samples cemetery:<br><br>Recently I wrote a detector for .NET framework. There are so many code examples for this in the wiki. It would be helpful, if some could be rated outdated and some others to be more recent. I would prefer to give the code samples with the highest rating my first look.<br><br>I think you have my point. What can we do to guide me and others to the best pieces of nsis 3rd party plugin and code samples universe?<br><br>Finally I want to thank everybody who has provided a plugin or any code samples. It helped me a lot.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
