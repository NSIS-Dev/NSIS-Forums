I'm trying to switch to NSIS. I have a couple questions:<br><br>Are all OCX's DLL's and TLB's registered automatically or do I have to call a function (if so which function)?<br><br>I have made a script and tested it, but if my program is running it obviously cannot write to the files (since they are running). How can I check if running processes are running and/or tell the user to stop them before continuing. Does it need a restart? My previous progam installer I believe it made them restart and then it installed the components that couldn't be installed. How do I do this?<br><br>Thanks!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Mark Nascimento</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th August 2006 05:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I use this (win98):<br><br>ClearErrors<br>Rename C:\SomeDir\App.exe C:\SomeDir\App.exe ;If app.exe is in use, error.<br>IfErrors 0 +3<br>MessageBox ...(if you want)<br>Abort ;(if you want, or do something,)<br><br>I also ask IfFileExists, avoid looping.

<code><br>  LookForProcesses:<br>  Processes::FindProcess "RSA"<br>  ${If} $R0 == "1"<br>    MessageBox MB_OKCANCEL "The ********* Apocalypse Client is still running.

</pre><br>
      <br>
      Ok anyways the first message box (where I have \n\r) is getting some of the words cut out. Is there a way around this or should I just make it shorter.

      <p class="post-content">It's not \r\n in NSIS, it's $\r$\n.<br>
      You are better off using the <a href="http://nsis.sf.net/FCT_plug-in" target="_blank">FCT plugin</a> for this. It tries to close the program first and then only terminates it after a confirmation message box.<br>
      <br>
      See <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixB.html" target="_blank">Appendix B</a> of the NSIS manual for DLL/TLB installation and uninstallation.<br>

      <p class="post-content">I need help with that plugin. Also where do I put the includemacro? Could you give me an example usage for that plugin if I want it to close rsa.exe?<br>
      <br>
      EDIT: I've figured that includemacro goes in the section part after file. Finding a starting point in NSIS was hard, literally. In the help files there should be something along the lines of:<br>
      <br>
      Structure of a basic install<br>
      -declarations<br>
      -macros<br>
      -Following lines to define nsis variables<br>
      <br>
      Name "${PRODUCT_NAME} ${PRODUCT_VERSION}"<br>
      OutFile "install.exe"<br>
      InstallDir "$PROGRAMFILES\ProductName"<br>
      InstallDirRegKey HKLM "${PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY}" ""<br>
      ShowInstDetails show<br>
      ShowUnInstDetails show<br>
      <br>
      -Sections to define extraction from exe and to define copy from outside files, script and custom elements here.<br>
      <br>
      Section MainProgram<br>
      SetOutPath "$INSTDIR" ;file on user system, destination, other values listed below<br>
      SetOverwrite on ;other values listed below<br>
      File "myprog.exe" ;file on build system, if on drive c would conform to C:\myprog.exe<br>
      <br>
      End Section<br>
      <br>
      Section Uninstall<br>
      ;uninstall section use delete and RMDIR (For directories) to delete files<br>
      <br>
      End Section<br>
      <br>
      -here I would put a list of constants and stuff (like where $INSTDIR is and where $SYSDIR is etc.<br>
      <br>
      It would help newbies like me to quickly start making an installer. I had to go through some random help files and make an installer (bad generated code BTW) with HM NIS edit.<br>
      <br>
      Anyways thanks so far but I still don't get that plugin you described. Does it look for window titles? hWnds? What defines what it looks for. Doesn't seem to have a EXE file paramater.</p>

      <p class="post-content">PLug-in finds application by it's window, 2 string parameters - window title and class. Can find by title or class substring. First sends WM_CLOSE to all windows found, after this (if application still alive) terminates program. To get window class string you can use spyxx.exe (included to MS VS). Put included to zip dll to NSIS/plugins folder before installer compile.</p>
