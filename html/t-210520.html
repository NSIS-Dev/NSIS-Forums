      <p class="post-content"><strong>Complying with GPL</strong><br />
      I managed to convince my boss to ditch Installshield, and start using NSIS, and we have never looked back, things are finally under our control!! We did however make some subtle changes to the NSIS source code to make it entirely fit our needs.<br />
      <br />
      Specifically, I uncommented the #define CONFIG_LOG as this was usefull to us, and we could afford the overheard it used. We also made changes to the file write routine where the files are extracted, so that if an original file existed with the same name, a backup is made of that file before the new file is written. This provided us with a "rollback" capability in our software.<br />
      <br />
      I realise that to comply with the GPL, our changes need to be available to the public. Is creating a page in the NSIS Archive with the a sourcecode patch suitable for complying with the GPL requirements of NSIS?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You are indeed correct. Somehow I got it into my head it was GPL, rather than Zlib/PNG.<br />
      <br />
      The changes we made were not exactly earth shattering, and it's doubtfull anyone would require them, however if you think you need rollback capability, and find this forum post, by all means email me, and I will give out the sourcecode changes.,,</p>
