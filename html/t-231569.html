If you call the plugin Unload function from the Leave function, it crashes the installer which also occurs when calling it in the abort function (when user clicks Cancel). I'm guessing this is because the dialog is no longer in memory then?<br><br>So basically the problem is that I need to call this Unload function when the user leaves my modified page (Next, Back, Cancel) and before they close the installer. The best way that worked 100% for this was when using a Custom page and placing the Unload function directly under the InstallOptions::dialog call.<br><br>Now, my feature request would be for normal pages: Could a new optional parameter be added to the Page / PageCallbacks instructions to set a function which is called when the user clicks ANY of the Next, Back or Cancel buttons while the Page is still in view. Here I can safely call the Unload function.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">deguix</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st November 2005 20:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Maybe there is a place where the "/NOUNLOAD" was not used before this call or, like you said, plug-in problem which doesn't return something to NSIS control or something not freed after the plug-in is freed from memory. Maybe some code would clarify this more.<br><br>btw, there is a very old InstallOptions modification which supports to unload the plug-in using a function. If I remember right, it is a little buggy in this too.<br><br>EDIT:</p><blockquote>Now, my feature request would be for normal pages: Could a new optional parameter be added to the Page / PageCallbacks instructions to set a function which is called when the user clicks ANY of the Next, Back or Cancel buttons while the Page is still in view. Here I can safely call the Unload function.</blockquote>InstallOptions handles the "WM_NOTIFY_OUTER_NEXT" message. This message tells when a click is done on the next, back or cancel buttons. For me I don't see the reason for implementing an "unload" function if you can have a way to communicate with the user on the "leave" function to tell it it needs to be unloaded (i.e. using ini files for InstallOptions pages).</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st November 2005 22:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Ok thanks I'll have a look at WM_NOTIFY_OUTER_NEXT.<br><br>There is still the problem that the plugin needs to be called atleast once without /NOUNLOAD before closing the installer.

Nasty one, too, DrWatson gets all confused by it :)<br><br>I've since resorted to storing the plugin dir in a temporary registry location and launching a second, silent installer that pauses for a few seconds at the end of the first installer. This second installer grabs the plugin directory from the registry, zaps its contents, then the dir itself (if empty), then removes the registry entry.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd November 2005 08:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yeh that's what I resorted to also when writing a plugin for a fellow NSIS member.

      It doesn't crash which is a good sign, but it doesn't unload the plugin either.<br>
      <br>
      Edit: Ok I see the problem. I need to pass the module MHANDLE as the parameter.<br>
      <br>
      Edit #2: Updated code, still does not work (now it crashes too).<br>

      <p class="post-content">Could you post again when/if you've updated the plugins?<br>
      I'd love to give it a try again and see if things don't crash with the new methods - the post-install deleter thing scares me a bit :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why not call the Unload function in .onGUIEnd like with BgImage? That callback function is executed after the dialog is ended. That means no further window messages will be processed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That works lol<br>
      I didn't like the fact that my window procedures would still be in use until you close the installer, but I guess that'll just have to be... shouldn't cause any problems hopefully.<br>
      <br>
      Uploaded ScrollLicense and ToggleInstFiles which both use .onGUIEnd to Unload in the examples.<br>
