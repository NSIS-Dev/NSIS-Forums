      <p class="post-content">You have to manually check for file existence. You can make a macro out of it for convenience.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The only 'problem' you'll run into is that you have to explicitly handle every file that you might add with a File command separately. I.e. you can't use File "somedir\*.*" to include multiple files as there's no way to get, from that, which files would be included.<br />
      <br />
      You would have to compile the exact list of files to include - which you could do with another installer that you run before compiling the main installer.<br />
      <br />
      If it were at all possible to get callback functions for SetOutPath, File and WriteReg* (and any other commands that may implicitly affect the file system/registry), so that you can do some per-item checking on folders and files, I would certainly jump on it ;)</p>
