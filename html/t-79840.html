      <p class="post-content"><strong>Would like your opinion.</strong><br />
      Hello everyone,<br />
      <br />
      I am about to release a product -- Pankaj Arora Software's Tumi Cursor PowerPack -- that uses NullSoft's NSIS Installer. I credited NullSoft near the bottom of the license agreement portion of the installation as they deserve much credit for this fine system they have developed. My product also features the voice of JJ McKay, the same guy who does the "Winamp - it really whips the lama's ass" that we're all so fond of hearing upon a fresh installation of Winamp.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway - I just wanted to get your opinions on my use of the install system, as this is the first time I have used it. Also, I wanted to give you NSIS developers a sneak-peak of the product -- it is the final version and is currently being distributed to the major download sites. Please - good or bad - tell me what you think.<br />
      <br />
      You can download it from here (requires Windows 95 or above):<br />

      Thanks very much for your input,<br />
      <br />

      I cross-posted this message (just once) in the general forum. The thread is here:<br />

      Someone accused my post as being essentially a promotion tactic. I'm sorry if I came off this way, I genuinely just want some feedback if you guys/gals donâ€™t mind. Sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused - I have an explanation of my actions on that thread. Thanks.<br />
      <br />
      Take Care,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Next time, if you have questions post them here. If your install doesn't work correctly, just post the script and we will take a look at it. For now the install seemed to work properly at a Win2K station, but I cannot judge the script without seeing it!<br />
      <br />
      Good luck, greetz,<br />
