      <p class="post-content"><strong>Yet another Vista related problem</strong><br />
      So i would like to start by saying that my problem is shortcut deletion related. I know that are lots of topics on this matter and i've read them all. Still i have the following problem<br />
      <br />
      I have an installer for my program . The script that generates the installer uses <b>RequestExecutionLevel admin</b>. All works well with it (creating the shortcut, deleting them on uninstall ...the works).<br />
      Now the problematic part:<br />
      I am doing a patch for the installed program. This patch will rewrite the executable of the program. This new executable has a new name, different from the old one (cant use the old name, and pls don't ask why a new name... this is not relevant :) ). So ...at this moment i have to redo the Start menu icon to point to the new executable, and the desktop one too . So the way i've done it in the patch script is to delete the old shortcuts and make new one for the new executable.<br />
      Works well for the desktop one. Does not work for the start menu one. The script for the patch also uses <b>RequestExecutionLevel admin</b><br />
      <br />
      In the original installer the SM icon is created like<br />
      <br />
      CreateShortCut "$SMPROGRAMS\${PRODUCT_NAME}\$firmName\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk" "$INSTDIR\${EXE_NAME}"<br />
      <br />
      In the patch is deleted like<br />
      <br />
      Delete "$SMPROGRAMS\${PRODUCT_NAME}\$firmName\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk"<br />
      <br />
      i have looked in the patch and message boxed the delete string and the path is good.</p>

      <p class="post-content">First question: Are you absolutely sure that PRODUCT_NAME etc are defined exactly the same as in the original installer? You did mention that your exe filename changed...<br />
      <br />
      Edit: In fact, it's bad form to use a variable to delete files whose names are entirely fixed (that is, not variable). Just use<br />
      <br />
      Delete $MSPROGRAMS\full path as it was used in the first installer\full filename as it was used.lnk<br />
      Delete $MSPROGRAMS\full path as it was used in another earlier installer\full filename as it was used2.lnk</p>

      <p class="post-content">MSG ..thanks for the reply ... been staring at the script for 2.5 hours (the script won the staring contest :) ) and found the problem. As usually it was just in front of my eyes but i've overlooked it over and over and over again ( one extraspace in PRODUCT_NAME in patch ...pfff). Sometimes just talking with someone helps :).<br />
      Thanks. Problem solved.</p>
