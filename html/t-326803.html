The actual colours refelct how Windows is configured, and I use a scheme Microsoft call 'silver' I think.

While you can customize the bitmap to something other than the nsis default images, it does require you to actually create a image while the icon is automatic.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
