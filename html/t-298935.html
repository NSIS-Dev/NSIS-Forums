      <p class="post-content"><strong>Localised UTF8</strong><br />
      I have made our NSIS installer multilingual and the localisation of the 18 LangString files is done by Sisulizer.<br />
      This works fine for most languages. I have problems whereby Russian shows my LangStrings in obscure characters. Whether or not I have set Russian locale and Unicode on traget PC.<br />
      <br />
      Main script ANSI<br />
      LangString files ANSI<br />
      Sisulizer localises in ANSI<br />
      C# post processor writes correct per-language header line in each of the localised LangString files (base file is neutral...) This app writes out UTF8<br />
      NSIS compiled<br />
      Installer runs OK for most languages.<br />
      NSIS Russian strings appear OK.<br />
      Custom Russian strings do not.<br />
      <br />
      So<br />
      <br />
      I changed the LangString files to UTF8 and Sisulizer to write out UTF8 localised LangString files.<br />
      This still did not work, different garbage at install time.<br />
      <br />
      I then changed Sisulizer to add the BOM. Still not working.<br />
      <br />
      Since NSIS strings work ok in Russian, the ANSI is fine.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Question - is there a way to get this to work with UTF8?<br />
      <br />
      If not, I can revert Sisulizer to write specific code pages for my LangString files, and change my C# post-process to write out in specified code pages. Would that work?<br />
      <br />
      If not, I can switch to the Unicode NSIS. I have read most of the thread on this option but am nervous about the A/W calls and other concerns that I may not be aware of.<br />
      <br />
      I am not completely sure what plugins we are using - I inherited the script. Here are the Includes<br />
      !include "FileFunc.nsh"<br />
      !include "LogicLib.nsh"<br />
      !include "MUI.nsh"<br />
      !include "nsProcess.nsh"<br />
      !include "ServiceLib.nsh"<br />
      !include "WordFunc.nsh"<br />
      <br />
      What's my best option to get my own strings to display correctly on a Russian locale PC?</p>

      <p class="post-content">update:<br />
      <br />
      I changed the C# post-process to both read and write in the particular code page, as well as reverting Sisulizer to write out in those code pages.<br />
      <br />
      It works.<br />
      <br />
      When will the main product become Unicode?....</p>
