      is it possible to open a directory and mark a certain file, so one doesn't have to go through a (supposedly big) directory to find the file? most browsers can do this for downloads.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Probably - if you opened the browse dialog yourself ;)<br />

      If you specify the filename in the nsDialogs::SelectFileDialog call, it'll pre-select that file in the prompt area.. but the 'explorer view' won't have it selected / scrolled into view. Not sure what you'd need that for unless the user can optionally open the file you'd pre-select but is statistically likely to actually want to open a file that is visually (in the explorer view) close to the one you pre-selected.<br />
      <br />
      off-topic.. you can highlight the explorer view part, start typing the name of a file of interest, and it'll scroll right to that file - no need to scroll through manually :)</p>

      </blockquote>i don't need to open a file, i just want to find it for a user. it's not important though, thought there's a simple way to do this as it's already possible in nsDialogs. maybe i can figure out a different approach.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I'm curious why you're trying to 'find a file for a user' if you already know what it's called and you're not actually using it to open the file or anything.<br />

      Unless you slap a name like VisualFileFinder on it and sell it for $2.99 in the App Store, that is.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ahhh gotcha - well done :)<br />
      I wonder why there's a delay in your UI drawing when you change the paths.. we've got pretty much the same thing going on (green/orange/red depending on path validity).. perhaps LockWindow on/off?</p>
