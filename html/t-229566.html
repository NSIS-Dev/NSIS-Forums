NSIS Installer Deletes files you may not want it to,,,</strong><br>I have just found out the hard way.<br><br>Be careful when you upgrade your version of NSIS. The installer (or rather the embedded unistaller) deletes anything you may have added to the NSIS directory. At least I have confirmed that anything I added to the contrib folder is gone. I have not verified 100% that it deleted what I added to the include folder.<br><br>Luckily this is not a disaster because anything I custom made was backed up. However I have a rather large collection of icons and includes that I have donwloaded from the internet that are now all gone and I have to try and find them again. In the meantime all of my scripts are broken and cannot compile until fix the links to the missing graphics and includes. This is a huge inconvenience.<br><br>Be aware of this and for future reference, it would be nice if the un-installer gave some sort of warning.... WARNING all user files that have been added to the NSIS directories will be lost!!!!!<br><br>I have loved NSIS but this is atypical unistaller behaviour and a warning would have been appreciated.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JasonFriday13</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st October 2005 23:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I have noticed that the uninstaller dosen't delete the files in the root dir of nsis (${NSISDIR}) and that when you install again, the installation overwrites the nsisconf.nsh. Maybe the uninstaller would only uninstall the files that it installed. And when installing could check that the nsisconf.nsh file exists, and if it does, leave it alone.<br><br>note: I now have over a hundred posts :).</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
