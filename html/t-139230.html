      I'm a newbie and maybe I'm diving in a little too deep for my first time. Okay. Way too deep!<br />
      <br />
      I've posted on this forum before for this but I'm still stuck.<br />
      <br />
      I am building and install program. Duh! My install will be running from a CD. I need it to copy two files to the System Directory. One is a bmp image and one is a simple text file. (The install has more features but it is simply adding more files and registry entries. I figured that part out.) The problem is that I need to edit one specific line in the text file with specific information provided by the user at the time of the install. (It is a configuration file and I need to edit the line containing the model number information for the specific machine that the user needs to enter into a text box during installation.) How can I accomplish this. I'm not worried about using ModernUI unless it's easier. I can always tweak it later once I have a working script.<br />
      <br />
      I appreciate any help you can give. Thanks.<br />
      <br />
      It should be known that this will be used for business purposes, so if you provide code snippets etc. and would like to recognition, please let me know.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If your file configuration is *.ini<br />

      For the information provided by the user at the time of the install,<br />
      check the Install Options readme about to add objects in custom pages<br />
      and how to read those entries.

      <p class="post-content">Okay, I think I've gotten that figured out now. Thanks for the help. Two final questions. Does NSIS support installation from .cab files? And is anyone currently working on support for downloading via full-time connections (cable, DSL, T1, etc.)?</p>

      <p class="post-content">There is currently the NSISdl plugin to download files and ZipDLL to unzip from zip files.<br />
      I used the command-line version of 7za to create zip files, so I assume that it will already have support for cab extraction and compression.<br />
