      <p class="post-content"><strong>Language files and script sample</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I am not sure if I have to provide the language files saved with the correct codepage (as seems to be the ones from C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files) or is it ok if I provide just an UTF-8 file.<br />
      <br />
      In order to test this I tried to use the C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\Arabic.nsh as this one is supposed to be saved in the correct form.<br />
      <br />
      So steps I did:<br />
      <br />
      - Create a very simple installer<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />...<br />!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "English"<br />!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "Arabic"<br />!include "Arabic.nsh"<br />...<br />Function .onInit<br />  !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br /><br />    StrCpy $msg "${MUI_TEXT_LICENSE_TITLE}"<br />    MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_OK "$msg"<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      - and as I couldn't use the Arabic.nsh as it's by default provided, I opened it with VC++ editor, deleted all the lines except:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />  !define MUI_TEXT_LICENSE_TITLE "***1573;***1578;***1601;***1575;***1602;***1610;***1577;***8207; ***1575;***1604;***1578;***1585;***1582;***1610;***1589;"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      and then just save it.<br />
      <br />
      Problem is, when I run the installer I am not able to see the right chars. All I see are "monkeys". Please see the attached files: momo.nsi and Arabic.nsh.<br />
      <br />
      Questions:<br />
      1) Can you pls tell me what am I doing wrong above?<br />
      2) Can smbd pls give me an arabic.nsh with just one correct define?<br />
      3) Once I have the above I'll keep trying, with and without UTF-8, but still I can ask: can I provide the language files saved in UTF-8 format? or do I have to provide the file in the correct codepage? (pls note that I'm not familiar with codepage and languages)<br />
      <br />
      Thx,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Seems I am really lost. I tried the sample written in my first entry, and not only my custom string looks fishy, but also the NSIS default dialogs look weird.<br />
      <br />
      I have the right languages installed (Arabic) so I really don't understand what's the issue.<br />
      <br />
      Please see in the attached file:<br />
      - the script I was playing with<br />
      - that I have the right language installed<br />
      - how the NSIS built-in dialog in Arabic looks on my system (I have Win 2000 English installed).<br />
      <br />
      Can someone pls tell me what am I doing wrong?<br />
      <br />
      Thx,<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, after trying everything around I finally got the point so I will post the answers to my own questions:<br />
      <br />
      1) In order to see NSIS Arabic dialogs it's needed to set the corect codepage (on Win 2000: Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Regional Options -&gt; Set Default -&gt; choose an Arabic). Once this is set I can see correct both: my dialog and the NSIS dialogs.<br />
      <br />
      2) My second post contains a correct Arabic.nsh with only one define.<br />
      <br />
      3) No, using utf-8 language files won't work. The language files _have_ to be saved with the correct codepage. iconv is a tool that can be used for this.<br />
      <br />
      If the above is not OK pls correct me.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">You're correct. By the way, there's a valid Arabic NSH file in Contrib\Modern UI\Languge files\Arabic.nsh.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thx kichik for the answer, but as I wrote above that Arabic.nsh file couldn't just be added to a project as contains more than just some defines, this is why out of that file I was trying to create a small version with only one define.<br />

      <p class="post-content">One more question related to the language subject: is there a way to prevent the user to choose a language for the installer that is not supported by the current codepage? I mean let's say I have in my installer the following languages: english, german, arabic, so when a user starts the installer he can select any of these 3 languages regardless of it's codepage. So if the user has an english system and he chooses arabic he will see just "monkeys". Can I somehow make so that in the language-dialog-selection are shown only the languages that fit the codepage of the user? (in the sample above to show english and german and not also arabic)<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can call <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_21bk.asp?frame=true" target="_blank">GetACP</a> using the System plug-in and compare the result to that of the languages. You can then push to LangDLL just the supported languages.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wouldn't it be a decent requirement for some feature version of NSIS this to be somehow done by default? I mean doesn't make any sense on an english codepage to even let the user choose arabic. He'll just complain afterwards :)<br />
