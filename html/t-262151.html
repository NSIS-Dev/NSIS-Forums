      I finally have gotten the JRE detection working right. It has taken flippin two days of reading thru the code to understand what it was doing and when. It now detects everything fine and moves to do the proper install.<br />
      <br />
      I have one part left to figure out. Is there a way to jump to the next section. Say I set a variable to "a" and at the beginning of a section I check the variable, if true it continues down the line, if false it basically needs to skip the section. Right now I have it going to End: which shows a complete page with a next button, I would rather it go straight to the beginning of the next section instead of End: of the current section....<br />
      <br />
      Right now at the beginning of the section I have this<br />
      <br />
      Strcmp $DOWNLOAD_FLAG "download" Install End</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sections are executed in tact once you hit the button Install, how does this show a Next button when you jump to the end of a section? Do you have 2 InstFiles pages or do you mean functions used on custom pages?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well...I dont know exaclty why, but I was tweaking things and putting in some additional features and put in the line<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
      <br />
      and now it goes to the right starting point if JRE is installed...<br />
      <br />
      Id like to know WHY....just so I know.</p>
