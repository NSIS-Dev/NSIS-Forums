      <p class="post-content"><strong>HM NIS Edit doesn't help</strong><br />
      I read at <a href="http://hmne.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://hmne.sourceforge.net/</a> that "...[the HM NIS Edit] Script Wizard will help you to create standard Setup programs with only few clicks..." I can't even find anything called a Script Wizard in HM NIS Edit.<br />
      <br />
      I imagine some installers being pretty simple and not requiring reading long documentation. For now, I'd settle for one that just downloads and unzips a file, and maybe adds a directory to PATH. A desktop icon would be nice too. It seems like it should take only "a few clicks" to create such an installer, but it looks like it would take a NSIS beginner a lot more effort than that.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone have any tips on how to quickly create a simple installer, or should I start reading the NSIS documentation from the beginning?<br />
      <br />
      Sorry if this sounds like a no-effort question, but the first thing I'd use the installer for is a program I created called EZ TAR which was inspired by the long GNU tar instructions and lack of a good, free, self explanatory tar GUI, and I'm getting the same bad vibes from NSIS and HM NIS Edit.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks! I thought it would be in "NSIS" or "Tools" or that "?" would help me. I still had to randomly explore to figure out how to save an executable installer, but I got lucky that time. I figured out how to compile it, then I executed the command under "command line" from the lower window, and then I read the end of the output at the command line, and saw a path next to "output," and that was the executable installer.<br />
      <br />
      Now I have to dig into the documentation to figure out if I could add to the PATH environment variable. Hmmm... I thought I asked for a desktop icon but I don't see one. That should be easy enough to look up.</p>

      <p class="post-content">In the normal installation of HM NSIS, the installer can left a desktop icon.<br />

      If you don't have one, you can make one, with Windows Explorer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The first things I found in my search for a way to programmatically add to Windows' Path environment variable were the "set" command and a Perl module. Unfortunately, with those methods the new Path entry only lasts until the command prompt is closed and it isn't reflected in Windows' System Information GUI. Then I tried the following from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lgoddard/Tk-Wizard-Bases-1.06/Wizard/Installer/Win32.pm" target="_blank">http://search.cpan.org/~lgoddard/Tk-...aller/Win32.pm</a> :<br />
      <br />
      "If you are looking for a means to update the Windows Path variable, have a look for PathTool.exe, a tiny Windows 32-bit executable by Luke Bailey (luke@notts.flexeprint.com). This tool can also be used to add new, persistant environment variables to the system."<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure if that email address is still valid, and I don't want to bother Luke if I don't have to, so I searched Google for PathTool and found the following:<br />

      Has anyone tried any of those? Any other suggestions on what to use to programmatically add a directory to Path on Windows?<br />

Maybe I'll combine the two.</p>
