      <p class="post-content"><strong>Modal MessageBox</strong><br />
      Guys,<br />
      <br />
      Is there an option to make a MessageBox modal? MB_TOPMOST doesn't seem to do the trick. I have a question box that I want to be centre/top and unable to do anything until answered.<br />
      <br />
      Is this possible with NSIS?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure what your problem is. The MessageBox instruction produces a modal message box which until a selection is made, halts code execution. Where are you showing one?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I want one similar to a modal box like mfc produces so it takes focus. Not just installation halt but doesn't allow anything else to be done too until question answered. Like if you click outside of the box, the computer will ding.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To make a Messagebox modal you have to pass the parent window handle instead of NULL.<br />
      <br />
      You can do this by</p>
      <pre>
<code>!include "${NSISDIR}\Examples\System\System.nsh"<br />!define STYLE ${MB_OK}|${MB_ICONINFORMATION}<br />System::Call 'User32::MessageBox(i $HWNDPARENT, t "The text", t "A caption", i ${STYLE}) i.'</code>

      <p class="post-content">jweinraub I very much doubt this is possible with Windows as is. Have you ever seen this done before in an installation wizard?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I've seen it done before in some applications that throw an error (and I don't mean the UAC prompt).. so it can be done, but it sure is annoying(!)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Techically that example is modal to the parent window, not the desktop. I believe a true modal dialogue won't let you do anything else until that has been answered...<br />
      <br />
      But I don't plan on doing anything that will make our customers annoyed it was just a curiosity question.</p>

      </blockquote>Yes, you're right.<br />
      I didn't understand what you are trying to do at first.<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>As far as I know, a modal dialog is only modal to it's parent window, not to windows from other programs.<br />

      To make something you want, you will have to do something like the Windows XP shutdown dialogbox:<br />
      Make a screendump, show it on top of everything, and place your dialogbox on top of that.<br />
      See <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/DimmerForm.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/DimmerForm.aspx</a> for an example (.NET)<br />
      <br />
      But as said before, I don't think that is something you want to do to your users...
