      <p class="post-content"><strong>Decrease installation creation time for multiple installations</strong><br />
      We have several installation packages which have base (non changeable) files and several small individual files for each installation.<br />
      Each client wants to see his logo and license text in the distribution package, but all exe and other files are the same for all.<br />
      When using Compression On (especially lzma) - MakeNSis application works too long (about an hour or so) to create all individual installations.<br />
      <br />
      THE QUESTION<br />
      Is it possible to prepare pre-compressed data files which won't be compressed during install creation process but certainly be decompressed on installation process using installer decompress functionality?<br />
      <br />
      May be someone has any other suggestion how to manage with such multiple installations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't know if what you're asking is possible... but might it be feasible to compile a generic installer once - and then use something like Resource Hacker's command-line functionality in a batch setup to create copies of the generic installer, and modify the resources within ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can compress them prior to creating the installer, and then include an appropriate extractor in the installer, which you'll compile with no compression. Extract both things to a temporary directory and run the extractor to put the files where they need to be.<br />
      <br />
      If you distribute your software on a CD or similar, you could optionally choose to just have the compressed file on there directly, and only have the extractor in the installer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Now I'm using external decompressor (lzma) to unpack files.<br />
      But NSIS already has built-in decompressor and I wanted to use it. :-)</p>

      <p class="post-content">In that case, you'd have to take a similar approach and make ONE installer, which you then pacakge into a different one.<br />
      <br />
      The principle is the same, so you should be able to figure it out. :)</p>
