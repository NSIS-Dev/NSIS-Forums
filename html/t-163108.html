Show list of apps in combo box (eg. "App1", "App2", etc.), so the user can select which app he wants to install<br><br>2. Connect to the Net<br><br>3. Get list of deps for said app (list.php?app=App2) -&gt; $TEMP\App2.ini<br><br>4. For each dep, check if installed and correct version<br><br>5. Download, install, registry if necessary<br><br>The goal is to make this installer app-independent, and very light so as not to pack/download any file that is already installed on the user's PC (some of our customers are still connected at 56Kbps).<br><br>Any idea if this can be done in NSIS? For instance, UpgradeDL requires that both files to be compared are installed on the host, which we'd like to avoid.<br><br>Thank you<br>JD.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">4th January 2004 11:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yes, this is possible.<br><br>If you want to use the UpgradeDLL macro, you will have to create a custom version that takes a version as parameter and downloads a file.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">janedoe2003</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th January 2004 00:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">&gt;&gt;If you want to use the UpgradeDLL macro, you will have to create a custom version that takes a version as parameter and downloads a file<br><br>Thanks :-)<br><br>OK, I read the whole CHM file... which has very few examples. Before I dive into the \Examples section, any code that someone already has to perform the following would be most appreciated. I assume I'm not the first person to want to write a basic installer that fetches files from the Net, so as to avoid forcing users to download big installers with lots of standards files they already have (VB runtime, etc.).<br><br>Step 1: Display a combo box with a list of apps, eg "App1", "App2" etc.<br><br>Step 2: Call a PHP script on a web server, with the app name as parameter (<a href="http://www.acme.com/list.php?app=app2" target="_blank">www.acme.com/list.php?app=app2</a>), and get list of files require to install this app<br><br>Step 3: Either parse the list returned in a HTTP connection (eg. CSV-formatted), or save list as INI file somwhere, and extract dependencies using the ad hoc functions<br><br>Step 4: Fill an array for those requirements, and iterate through the array, checking whether each file is already installed and in the correct version; Otherwise, download and install<br><br>Thank you for _any_ code you might have<br>JD.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th January 2004 13:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Everyone will probably have a different method of storing data and lists on the server.<br><br>It is not difficult at all. The easiest method is to use INI files on the server.
