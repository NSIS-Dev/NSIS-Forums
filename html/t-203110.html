(too many error!)<br>Not only grammer error , spell errors too. (sory my english is not good but my persian is very good Its my primary language)<br><br>PLEASE AND PLEASE AGAIN :: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE FILE WHITOUT NOTIC TO YOUR TRANSLATORS IN SAME LANGUAGE!!!<br>See end of this post for some error in language file.<br><br>There is some simple problem :<br>1- In Install location page , Edit must have left to right align Even if in RTL language. beacuse address are always left to right. (and this is same for list box and edit in start menu folder page)<br>2-In Install progress page , List for RTL language must have right align (word must begin in exactly right side) now they have just right to left reading.<br><br>after this I have another comment about NSIS. as usuall, a installer must run once. I think you can handle this with a simple command (global command) like MutexString "str" and UnMutexString "str" if installer(or uninstaller) has this command it must run only once .(May be I must post this in another place???)<br><br><br>Some errors in current farsi lang file (For other farsi translator - please add your comment if you know farsi)<br><br>Next : íÔÑæí - But next is ÈÚÏí not this !!!<br>Browse : ÔÊ&amp;Òäí - But its not a right word! it must be ÂÏÑÓ Ïåí Or some thing like this.<br>Show Detail : äãÇíÔ &amp;ÑíÒå˜ÇÑíåÇ its better to be äãÇíÔ ÌÒÆíÇÊ Or just ÌÒÆíÇÊ<br>Uninstall : Ç˜ÓÇÒí I know my word ÍÐÝ Is not a good word but Ç˜ÓÇÒí is very terrible!!! (Is your program a nuclear bomb?????)<br>Dont create shortcut : ãíÇäÈÑÓÇÒ !!!!!?????? I think dont create means DO NOT CREATE!!! not shortcut creator!!! it must be ãíÇäÈÑí äÓÇÒ.<br>ÔÑÇíØ Çíä ÊæÇÝÞäÇãå &amp;ÛíÑÞÇÈá ÒíÑÔ ÇÓÊ :<br>a wrong word : ÒíÑÔ!!! ---&gt; ÐíÑÔ Is ok.<br><br>and more and more ..
