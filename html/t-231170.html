<code><br>!macro INCREMENT VAR<br>IntOp ${VAR} ${VAR} + 1<br>!macroend<br><br>Section<br>!insertmacro INCREMENT $vr1<br>SectionEnd<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      At runtime, you can probably use a Function<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>Function increment<br>Exch $0<br>IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br>Exch $0<br>FunctionEnd<br><br>Section<br>Push $vr1<br>Call increment<br>Pop $vr1<br>SectionEnd<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      However, I am not sure if this is what you are looking for.<br>
      What exactly are you trying to do with these "dynamic" variables?

      <p class="post-content">I should have explained better.<br>
      What I am trying to do, is to read 16 different values from an INI file (State and Text) and place each one into a matching named NSIS variable. I have this working, but it would be really nice if I could just put it into a "loop". Would make the scipt easier to read and more maintainable.<br>
      :D<br>
      <br>
      To put this into a program loop, I need to be able to use what I was calling "dynamic" NSIS variables.<br>
      <br>
      Can you suggest a method to do this?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks<br>

      <p class="post-content">StrCpy $0 "1"<br>
      IntOp $vr$1 $vr$1 + 1<br>
      <br>
      Shouldn't $0 actually be $1? You're setting the integer 1 to the variable $0.<br>
      <br>
      But in the next line, when you're trying to run an integer operation on it, you're trying to run it on $vr$1, and you never set anything to $1.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe I'm missing something here, but I don't see where else $0 comes into play.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, that was a "typo" on my part..<br>
      It should have been $vr$0</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, well in that case, I think you are using the IntOp operation on the wrong variable. You are using it on $vr$1, expecting it to increment the variable vr1 to become vr2. That won't happen, because it can not add an integer "1" to a string "vr1".<br>
      <br>
      You should run IntOp on $0.<br>
      IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br>
      <br>
      This way, the initial value "1", on the next loop becomes 2, and therefore the new variable that $vr$0 would access is "vr2".<br>
      <br>
      At least I think that's what should be happening.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, that is what I initially thought too.<br>
      But it seems the substituting "$vr$0" for "$vr1", does not work. (where $0 was set to "1").<br>
      <br>
      It works in normal string substitution, but not when you need it to refer to an NSIS variable.<br>
      <br>
      That is what I have been trying to get going...<br>

      <p class="post-content">That's because the substitution is being done at compiletime, not runtime.<br>
      At compile time, the compiler extracts a token named $vr$0 from the command.<br>
      It then tries to resolve the token and sees that it consists of two variables: $vr and $0.<br>
      When it tries to resolve $vr it fails.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, I understand what is happenig now.<br>
      Perhaps a future NSIS release could support something like this, or could have native array support!<br>

      <p class="post-content">I think that that would just add to the installer overhead.<br>
      <br>
      Edit: If you want to clean up your code, use a macro and insert it multiple times.<br>
