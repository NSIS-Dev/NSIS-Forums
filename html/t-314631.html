      <p class="post-content"><strong>Set permission failed on files generated with CopyFiles</strong><br />
      Hi, my installer includes some files I generate with CopyFiles during the installation process. I use AccessControl to give these files permissions. When I give permission on folder I do not get correct permission on the files I generated, but all others files in these folders get correct permission. I have to specify permission for each file I have generated to get correct permission.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone who know why it is like that?<br />
      <br />
      My code:<br />
      <br />
      SetOutPath $EXEDIR\test<br />
      File /r C:\test\test.conf-dist<br />
      <br />
      CopyFiles /SILENT "$EXEDIR\test\test.conf-dist" "$EXEDIR\test\test.conf"<br />
      <br />
      ; FAILED<br />
      AccessControl::GrantOnFile "$EXEDIR\test" "IUSR_TEST" "GenericRead + GenericExecute"<br />
      <br />
      ; OK<br />
      AccessControl::GrantOnFile "$EXEDIR\test\test.conf" "IUSR_TEST" "GenericRead + GenericExecute"<br />
      <br />
      Best regards, Frode</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, if the file is copied (created) by an Administrator installer, the file's owner will be Administrator, not IUSR_TEST. Thus the file may not be accessible by IUSR_TEST. On the other hand, generic read + execute would normally be allowed to any user, except guests maybe... I think.<br />
      <br />
      Another thing I can think of is $EXEDIR\test\test.conf-dist having inheriting disabled in its access settings. Though I'm not even sure if that is supposed to be maintained when a file is copied...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I do not understand why it should matter if the file is copied by an Administrator. I set the permissions on the created file in the installer, hence the file should get these permission and not the permission from the user who installed it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You may try to change the permission before extracting file into the test folder, rather than after ?<br />
      (I don't see why, but the permission may not be inherited automatically to files if the ACL is changed afterwards?)</p>

      </blockquote>The way I see it, you're setting permissions to the directory. Now I'm not an expert on ntfs permissions at all, but I could imagine an admin-owned file in a user-owned dir might do funky unexpected stuff. Then again it might not.
