We suspect that the installer's "exe" extension is the biggest factor, in that a customer's firewall or other security objects to that extension. Of course, many people do not have the slightest idea of how to get around this difficulty, but I would hope that they would not even have to think about it. It certainly is detrimental to the entire transaction.<br><br>Would anyone have any comments about this?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pospec</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd May 2008 11:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yes, I have.

We provide the download link both on a web page and by email. I'm not really concerned right here with the email aspect, but rather with the actual download of the installer being blocked in one way or another.<br><br>You are confirming the validity of one of my ideas -- to provide a zip version and let the customer make the choice. These things are difficult for many people, and such pain should not be present at the point of sale. I have been told emphatically that many people also struggle with what to do with a zip file.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd May 2008 20:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Windows will ask the user for permission to run a downloaded executable.

We do have cd's, and in a very short time the content on that cd can be outdated by our updates. That's one of the nicest things about downloadable products.<br><br>I think these various difficulaties are simply reflecting the digital revolution we're living through, and I am trying to navigate it smoothly; but it seems to me that there is only so much you can do to help someone understand such a process. I work with a lot of intelligent adults who can't always make sense of what's on the computer in front of them. Just giving them one more thing to think about, to click on, etc., can be hard on them. And that's with me standing next to them. Even one error message leaves them stuck. So I know I'm biting off a big chunk when I address problems of downloads.<br><br>Funny thing about zipping, I Winzipped my 70 meg installer and the size did not change. Besides, we use some Spanish characters, and at least via email, Winzipped attachments alter those characters.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
