I have the translation for the Korean word for English. This translated word contains a '|' and it is causing the word for English to be listed in the DropList as two entries. Is there a way to get around this?

No, latest is 2.4.4 beta 2, and I've fixed the images problem already.<br><br>Now, about the East Asian display in InstallOptionsEx: I still can't test the problem you're having, and you could have said from which version did this problem start from. It's not ok for me to keep guessing where the problem occurs in the code. I use string functions throughout the entire code. If you can't help me, then I can't help you.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
