(this would give it some kind of MS-flavour...)</b></blockquote>You're right. Microsoft has the annoying ambition to make everything look cool and great, but it doesn't work and crashes most of the time. They say that Windows XP is stable, but it has crashed already many times at my PC. As Microsoft would say: "It's your own fault."<br><br><blockquote><i>Also originally posted by Mosestycoon</i><br><b>But be serious, it already reached a very stable state, and works really cool (at least for me)</b></blockquote>You are definitely right. It looks and feels much better than NSIS 1.98 and it has many more options and a better documentation (altough it still could be better, in XML format for example :D ;)).<br><br>An installer is the most temporary program that exists: you start it, you enter some info, then you wait. When it's finished, most people delete the installer from their harddisks.<br>But, an installer has to look good. It is also some introduction to the program, and when the installer looks great, the program will look great too (so they think ;)).<br><br>I like cool installers. It gives you something to look at while waiting. For example: The Age of Empires I (!) installation shows an animation of some men building a triomph arc while you are waiting for the installation. The arc is finished when the installation is.
