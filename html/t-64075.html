The basic exehead remained the same size (although turns out to save 512 bytes when a packer such as UPX is used) but it gives a little more breathing space for future features. Basically just another case of getting the compiler to do more work and the exehead less...<br><br>So, here it is. The compiler converts references to variables (such as $INSTDIR and $STARTMENU) in strings to encoded versions ($A, $B, etc) so that the exehead doesn't need to know about their names. The expanding of variables in the installer is now a simple switch statement.<br><br><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dave.laundon/nsis161-DL.zip" target="_blank">Here</a> is a zip with a modified makensis.exe and two chunks of source code that made it.<br><br>Enjoy! :) and it would be great if it was deemed safe/good enough to merge in to the official NSIS ;)<br><br>--<br>Dave Laundon</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">justin</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th October 2001 00:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Heh I have been thinking about this one for a while =) .. the main reason I didn't want to touch it was for fear of breaking a lot.

Hadn't thought of that.. Yes, then just have an escape character for the few times one of those actual characters is needed. Mmm, will try that...<br><br>Another thought for reducing size - turning virtually every string literal in the exehead into entries in the string-list, regardless of whether they might need to be overridden in a .nsi script or not. That way they'd benefit from the zlib compression. Exehead still probably won't change enough for it's .exe size to change, but UPX etc should be able to crunch it down a bit more?<br><br>--<br>Dave Laundon</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">eccles</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th October 2001 22:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I knew there'd be something.<br><br>Places in the compiler that read previously stored entries from the string list get the encoded versions.
