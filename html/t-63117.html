Here is how it looks after the change :-) ... This adds around 12 Kb to the head though :( .. and I hope many NSIS er's are'nt going to flame me for changing the look... Justin, changing the color of the progress bar looks good though, why have it always plain... The same way as changing color of the list box we can have a option to change color of the progress bar too :-)., and an option to change between ordinary look of progress bar and smooth look. Plus does any one want this code ... you can change the look of progress bar by adding &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;ProgressColor "bgcolor" "fgcolor"&lt;/b&gt;<br>but for changing the picture you have to go and edit in the code ...<br><br><a href="http://anyedit.sourceforge.net/screenshotinst.gif" target="_blank">http://anyedit.sourceforge.net/screenshotinst.gif</a> &lt;br&gt;<br><br>-Deepak</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Someonebutnotme</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th October 2001 21:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">it might just be me, but I like nsis the way justin has it, plain and simple.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dbareis</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th October 2001 07:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Looks good but not sure its worth a 12K hit...<br><br>Anyway the one thing I'd really like to see on that screen is a horizontal scroller so I and others will at long last be able to actually read the contents of the progress listbox....<br><br>Bye<br>Dennis</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th October 2001 11:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>I think the 12k came form the bitmap</strong><br>You said it your self, to edit the bitmap you have to edit the code.
