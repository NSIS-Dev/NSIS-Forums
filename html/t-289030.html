      <p class="post-content"><strong>Installing VC++ 8.0.CRT redistributables</strong><br />
      I know this has been asked before, but I can't seem to find an answer.<br />
      <br />
      I have a program which depends on the VC++ 8.0.CRT redistributables (msvcr80.dll and friends) beeing installed system wide.<br />
      <br />
      We are currently using InstallShield Express, but would like to switch to NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      IS has an option that automatically installs redistributables. How can this be done using NSIS? I'd like to avoid calling the VC++ 8.0.CRT installer, but rather have NSIS do the installation.<br />
      <br />
      I'm a newbee to NSIS, so please spoonfeed me...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I did it for our installer by 'unpacking' the VC8 CRT exe, and getting the msi and cab files buried inside it. Then I call ExecWait to install those.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey,<br />
      <br />
      I'm on a same subject today (but I embed a VC++ 9.0 CRT) but it's the same.<br />
      <br />
      Here is what I've done :<br />
      <br />
      Section "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86)" SEC02<br />
      File "C:\Documents and Settings\nooky59\Bureau\vcredist_x86.exe"<br />
      ExecWait '$INSTDIR\vcredist_x86.exe /q:a /c:"VCREDI~3.EXE /q:a /c:""msiexec /i vcredist.msi /qn"" "'<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      I've found it there :<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/02/07/update-regarding-silent-install-of-the-vc-8-0-runtime-vcredist-packages.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archi...-packages.aspx</a><br />
      <br />
      But I want to go one step further if possible (if someone know how to do). I would like to forbid or to warn the user if he try to uninstall the Visual C++ runtime independently from the add / remove panel.<br />
      <br />
      Is this possible ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">That is not really possible, but it's not your problem either if the user uninstall's random runtimes.<br />
      <br />
      If the registry entry for VC9CRT does not have a comment, I guess you could add one, but that is a bit ugly and selfish<br />
      <br />
      Or if it's that big of a deal, create a little loader application in VC6 or whatever, that checks for v9 of the CRT and warns/re-installs if needed, then starts your real app. Or maybe switch to MSI, I think it supports stuff like that with it's special shortcuts</p>

      Basically you need to install Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest along with the run-time files in the same directory as the executable.</p>

      </blockquote>Yes, but I don't know if this the same problem for ojt who has initiated the topic but in my particular case, I can't simply put the runtime in the same directory.<br />
      <br />
      It works with my app, but I use Qt and the jpeg support is compiled as a DLL plugin, and it seems that this jpeg plugin don't find the runtime if it is not installed system-wide.<br />
      <br />
      So, there is perhaps other cases where a system-wide install of the runtime is needed.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your answers. Yes, perhaps with MSI has I've already seen such messages when trying to removing software parts.<br />
      <br />
      Else, the launcher could be a good idea, I have thought about that, I will do that if it is necessary to protect against runtime removing.

      <p class="post-content">Hoi!<br />
      Does anybody know, if there's a way to determine, wheter VC80 is already installed or not?<br />
      <br />
      We have to install it via the microsoft redistributable during our updates, because our applications need firebird 2.1 and the gds32.dll (of fb 2.1) needs MS VC80.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks, kichik. that's a very interesting tutorial.<br />
      <br />
      you mean i should use the system-plugin to call a api-function, which tells me if i need to install vc8.0?<br />
      <br />
      i gonna try to find that function...</p>
