      <p class="post-content"><strong>Using NSIS to create an installer for a VB Express 2005 Program</strong><br />
      Hey all!<br />
      <br />
      I discovered NSIS yesterday and so far i think its fantastic. I've been playing around with it, trying to make an installer for the payroll database program i'm currently working on (in VB 2005 Express). So far, i like what i've done: A modern UI with an welcme screen, licence agreement, an installation directory selection page and the option to install a start menu shortcut.<br />
      <br />
      This works great, and i've placed files, such as my readme.txt file to be installed and i've got it to uninstall everything.<br />
      <br />
      The problem though, is i don't know how to get it to actually install my vb program. I've read the posts on this forum and unfortunately can't make heads or tails out of them.<br />
      <br />
      Could someone explain to me which files from my Vb program i need to install and exactly how i can install them (i.e. where in my .nsi file i must place them.)<br />
      <br />
      I've attached my .nsi file for you all to look at and i'd welcome any comments and suggestions that i could do to improve the code as well.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your help<br />
      Laura</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS is great but also check InstallAware where you don't have to worry about which files to install and how because application runtimes are deployed by a single click with it.</p>
