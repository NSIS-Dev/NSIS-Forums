However, it's open-source, so you can easily add the custom dialogs. Calling the functions from .dlls might be a bit harder, as I beleive they are made to work with InstallShield, are they not? What, generally, are the functions in the .dlls related too? If we have some idea of what you're trying to accomplish in the install it will be easier to specifically answer your questions. A small post-installation program could be written to overcome NSIS limits without messing with the NSIS code.<br><br>-=Gonzotek=-</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">AndrewRich</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th July 2001 02:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Gonzotek</i><br><b>Calling the functions from .dlls might be a bit harder, as I beleive they are made to work with InstallShield, are they not?</b></blockquote>Pretty standard DLLs with exported functions. The prototypes are all LONG WINAPI if that makes any difference.<br><br><blockquote><b>What, generally, are the functions in the .dlls related too?

We have DLLs that export functions more easily implemented this way; a variety of file, service, and database functions. As an example, we have one DLL that exports the following functions:<br><br>CheckDB [check the existence of an SQL database]<br>CheckService [check the status of a service]<br>CreateDB [create an SQL database]<br>InstallLocalService [install a service as the System Account]<br>InstallLocalServiceX [install a service as another user]<br>RemoveLocalService [remove a service]<br>StartLocalService [start a service]<br>StopLocalService [stop a service]<br>KillProcess [kill a running process, uses PSAPI.DLL]<br>IsPortAvailable [check availability of a TCP port]<br><br>These functions are called during the installation of the application to, for instance, install the service or create the database in SQL Server.<br><br>The custom dialogs I mentioned are things like selecting an SQL Server host machine, entering between three and five TCP ports for the server application to use, entering passwords for the reporting agents to use.<br><br>The InstallShield project that builds this installer is just huge. It's out of control. So I'm looking for another solution that will still have the flexibility of InstallShield without the tremendous overhead.<br><br>Thanks for reading!</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">spaetz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th July 2001 11:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I guess you'd have to write a 5kb C app, that you hand over the name of the .dll and the function and it would basically call the .dll.

However I do not know about the specifics of this (search MSDN for info). I once tried to make a DLL that exported a function with this prototype: 'void MyRunDllProc(char *params);' but when I tried to run 'RunDll32 mydll.dll,MyRunDllProc someparams' RunDll32 failed. Also it's not advicable to use any external DLL function caller anyway, just rewrite NSIS to include a Instruction such as (syntax displayed):<br>CallDll retval($0-9|$INSTDIR|$OUTDIR) dllfile dllfunction parameters....<br>You could just use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress in the code of NSIS. I am sure this will work for most purposes, as long as the DLL function returns a string, number or nothing (void). Also the DLL function could have any parameters as long as it was char and int types, else you would also have to specify the types in the CallDll instruction.
