      <p class="post-content">${GetSize} gets the real size, as opposed to the size on disk. As I understand it, the Add/Remove programs number, if done correctly, is the size on disk, the size needed by the software before running out of disk space in the worst case situation. The size on disk value varies according to the file system, FAT32 or NTFS, and the drive's cluster size apparently.<br>
      <br>
      The NSIS documentation does not clearly state which of the two sizes the installer automatically calculates to determine the Space Required.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe someone, who has that knowledge, could provide an answer. My guess is it's the real size.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I had an idea -- a cut-and-paste job, like most of my ideas are. To obtain the size on disk, you can modify "GetSize" in FileFunc.nsh.<br>

      <p class="post-content">For Windows XP, I found that the only way to make Add/Remove display the estimated size was to also write the DWORD "WindowsInstaller" 1 - then it shows up. I don't know what other consequences are of setting that DWORD as we just discovered it a few minutes ago and are still testing.<br>
      <br>
      edit: Dammit, now the presense of "WindowsInstaller" 1 is preventing the entry from showing entirely. Why is this so convoluted?</p>

</pre>The Frequency value is an indication of the times the program is executed from a traceable shortcut from the Start Menu or Desktop. On the Add &amp; Remove Programs dialog this is expressed as "Rarely", "Occasionally", or "Frequently". I'm not sure what values trigger what title but It could be calculated by tweaking a know value by increments. I think this is also tied to the LastUsed date so it might not be as simple hard value ranges.

      <p class="post-content">On the subject again.<br>
      <br>
      Putting the size in the registry is one thing, getting the correct size is another.<br>
      <br>
      The Required Space, I think, is calculated at compile-time based on the section sizes. You could query SectionGetSize ${id} $0, and the value returned would be a similar figure in Kb.<br>
      <br>
      Is it size on disk? Size on disk is determined by the cluster size, which is your cluster size at compile-time.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to replace the NSIS estimate with your own more accurate size estimate, should it be size on disk (in Kb), your disk, or should it be derived from bytes? The same question when you write the size to the registry, bytes or size on disk?<br>
      <br>
      I would like to use size on disk.<br>
      <br>
      My questions are, a) what does the NSIS (section size) estimate use? b) can you get the cluster size in a system call? GetVolumeInformation "Kernel32:: ... ?<br>
      <br>
      Can anyone help? Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It occurs to me that the easiest way to find out the cluster size would be to write a 1 byte file and have the system tell you the size on disk. Only the system won't tell you. It'll tell you the file is 1 byte.<br>

      Is that correct?</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS (and most other programs) don't handle cluster size/on disk size at all.<br>

      <p class="post-content">You'd need that information too. Target compression as well as cluster size.<br>
      <br>
      Also, if the cluster size is wrong, 8Kb instead of 4Kb, for instance, or if the destination is compressed, would the size-used estimate be more or less accurate than the bytes value?<br>
      <br>
      I have never dealt with a compressed folder for an installation; I honestly don't know what happens. In case the folder is compressed, you could always revert to bytes, I'd say.<br>
      <br>
      The user wants to know how much space a program takes up to avoid running out of space among other reasons, no doubt. Size on disk gives an accurate picture, provided it is accurate.<br>
      <br>
      Do I withdraw the question?</p>

        SectionSetSize ${id2} $SIZE_2 ; the new size in KiB

      <br>

      <blockquote>
        SectionGetSize ${id2} ${TEMP1}<br>
        IntFmt ${TEMP1} "0x%08X" ${TEMP1}<br>
        WriteRegDword HKLM ${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY} "EstimatedSize" ${TEMP1}
      </blockquote>It hinges on cluster size. Without some means to test for it, LOGICAL must stay a pipe dream.<br>
      <br>
      Everything is illogical.

      <p class="post-content">Sorry to keep bumping this thread.<br>
      <br>
      I have made some headway and still have questions. Maybe someone can help.<br>
      <br>
      I'm thinking of doing an NTFS check first.<br>
      <br>
      StrCpy $0 $WINDIR 3 ; system drive<br>
      ${GetFileSystem} $0 $0<br>
      ${If} $0 == "NTFS"<br>
      <br>
      I could proceed to checking the cluster size.<br>
      <br>
      System::Call 'kernel32::GetDiskFreeSpace(i0,*i0r1,*i0r0,*i0r2,*i)'<br>
      <br>
      Multiplying $0 * $1 does that. To be on the safe side, I'm making NTFS a condition, though GetDiskFreeSpace should work on older Windows and FAT systems.<br>
      <br>
      This is where I have questions. Anders mentioned folder compression. Is folder compression something you can detect? What actually are the disk space consequences?<br>
      <br>
      Sparse files, also mentioned, are probably less of a concern. Why would anyone wish to convert the files my setup installs into sparse files?<br>
      <br>
      AFAIK, sparse files are used for disk images and p2p sharing. Is reinstalling possible?<br>
      <br>
      Could someone push me in the right direction for folder compression? The fact it was raised lets me suspect that a solution is not easily come by.<br>
      <br>
      Can you check if the destination directory is compressed?<br>
      <br>
      I would really appreciate a yes or a no. Instructions wouldn't be bad either. Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The best I can do.<br>
      <br>
      On the Directory page I can do a check for compression and, if compressed, the "Required space" changes to physical size, even if the other conditions for logical size are met.<br>
      <br>
      However, if the user chooses to install to a new folder, meanwhile leaving the compressed folder alone, a second installation to the new folder, the "Required space" won't change back to logical size until after the user exits the page.<br>
      <br>
      Only on clicking the Back button and returning to the Directory page would the user be aware of the new (old) size.<br>
      <br>
      It's a small glitch, but one that's impossible to fix, unless I disallow multiple installations.<br>
      <br>
      It seems almost better to stick with the original plan: always display logical size regardless of compression or not.<br>
      <br>
      Compressed directories and sparse files have given me something to consider, and I am grateful for your advice, Anders.:)</p>
