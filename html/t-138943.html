However, the "installer" that comes with it is... lame, to say the least (no possibility of even getting the user to agree to a license, for instance). Besides the fact that the install exe it produced didn't work on 3 out of the 3 test machines I tried it on. Hence, my interest in NSIS.<br><br>So, I've perused the hints in the archive on installing the VB runtime, but the Access runtime is more complicated (an executable, lots of dlls, who knows which ones are really necessary or which ones need to be registered and which can't). Has anyone had success with using NSIS for this? I figured rather than re-invent the wheel, I'd ask first... I couldn't find anything in the archives or forum posts about it...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th June 2003 13:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can also include the installer and run it silently.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Poplar</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th June 2003 01:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I thought of that, and would do it if (a) the installer actually worked and (b) it wasn't so huge -- even if you tell the packaging "wizard" that you don't want IE5 installed, it includes the files in its package.
