      <p class="post-content"><strong>Launch a flash movie in fullscreen</strong><br />
      Hello everyone-<br />
      <br />
      I am a pretty new NSIS user and have been forced to use NSIS for work. Anyway, I am no programmer...so please go easy on me.<br />
      <br />
      I have been using NSIS to make simple game installers for about 3 months now. You can see some of my handiwork at <a href="http://www.legacygames.com" target="_blank">www.legacygames.com</a>, some of the titles I worked on were: Clueless, Mean Girls, Pretty in Pink, Pet Pals...ect.<br />
      <br />
      So, I have found myself having to use NSIS for things other than installers lately. For example, I used NSIS to create an executable that spits out a config.ini file that has the install directory written in it for a game. (I know how to make the installer do this, but another company that we work with were not able to, hence the little config.exe).<br />
      <br />
      Now, I need to use it to make a little exe that will:<br />
      1. Launch a flash movie in full screen.<br />
      2. Close the movie after about 5 seconds.<br />
      3. Launch the game.<br />
      <br />
      I can get the movie to launch with 'Exec "$EXEDIR\flashmovie.exe"' but I can't get the movie to launch in fullscreen. I have tried using random parameters SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED, "-f" and even "fullscreen" as a shot in the dark.<br />
      <br />
      I know how to launch a game executable...it's the full-screen, waiting 6 seconds and closing down the movie that are giving me problems.<br />
      <br />
      I had to create a flash movie with an EXE extension to get the movie to even launch through NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      Please feel free to let me know if I should be trying to use another program and this is not something I can make NSIS do. Again, I am not a programmer and I am not well versed in NSIS. I built a lot of game installers, but they are all based on the same script that I built one time.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a lot for any input you can give.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hello all,<br />
      <br />
      We make the flash movie here...so I think that setting up the movie itself to open in fullscreen is definitely a possibility.<br />
      <br />
      We will give this a try.<br />
      <br />
      And to answer <b>Anders</b>, one of us made the movie in flash. It is a flash movie with an *EXE extension. I am not sure how my coworker made it, but I can get info on that.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers and thank you so much for your replies.<br />
