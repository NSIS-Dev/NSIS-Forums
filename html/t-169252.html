I'd be more than willing to share the space with the NSIS development team, free of charge. If you wanted your own independent domain name instead of winampunlimited.com, you could probably cheaply purchase your own and have it forward itself to my hosting servers, so you don't have to pay monthly fees.<br><br>Most likely, I will have 10 GB of bandwitdh at my disposal.
