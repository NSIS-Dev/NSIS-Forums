      This morning, Microsoft Antispyware reported to me that NSISDl.dll was spyware of a "High Threat Level".<br />
      Anyone else see this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">nsisdl.dll was apparently used in some trojan horse. We've had lots of reports about this a couple of months ago. As far as I know, all anti-virus companies have already updated their definition files to make a better distinction. It seems like Microsoft is simply lagging behind. If the beta has a report feature of some kind, send them a note. If it doesn't have one and the latest version still detects nsisdl.dll, I'll have a word with them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The submitter should be the vendor, but that's just a suggestion. The first question is whether you're the vendor or not. I can not keep filling these submission forms for every little company that decided the anti-spyware business is the next big thing and accidentally mistook NSIS or part of it for spyware just because some spyware was using it.

      <blockquote>
        Thank you for your recent inquiry about NSISdl plug-in and the issue you reported. Today, we updated the signature library for Microsoft Windows AntiSpyware to version 5713. We believe this new signature library contains the updates necessary to address the issue that you raised. This new signature library is now available for users who subscribe to the automatic signature update mechanism, as well as users who choose to manually update their signature library.
      </blockquote>Please let me know if it's still giving false positives on NSISdl.dll so I can report it to them.

      <p class="post-content">I have version 5719 of the signature library and MS Antispyware is still detecting nsisdl.dll as spyware. I'm runing xp pro sp2. I submitted a report to microsoft stating that this is a false positive.<br />
      <br />
      Is there any other action we can take? Is there plan of action to address this with microsoft aside from the false positive reporting that I and other users/nsis devs have done?<br />
      <br />
      Our product is installed using nsis and (like many other products) it goes out to 100s of thousands of users so this is quite alarming for my company. Fortunately we found the problem before our customers have but its only a matter of time.<br />
      <br />
      Any information on your plan of action here would be greatly appreciated because we can use that to keep the fires under control while this gets worked out.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your help and support. We are big fans of NSIS and are confident that you'll work this out quickly.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I have had this problem for a while and I keep<br />
      telling the program that it is a false virus.<br />
      <br />
      I worry that users of this installer will think the<br />
      installed files are viruses. I searched around the<br />
      net and found many complaining about it worrying<br />
      where it came from. Some don't know that it is a<br />
      plug-in used to download in installers from NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      The most I can say is if any others are<br />
      too worried they could use <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=548" target="_blank">InetLoad</a>.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The reason behind the problem is that a malious piece of software has abused code from NSISdl (NSIS plug-in that support HTTP downloads). That's why some virus-scanners and anti-spyware tools reported it as a virus.<br />
      <br />
      Only installers that use the NSISdl plug-in can be affected by this false positive. Howver, all these problems have been solved except this single issue with the MS tool. I'm sure this will also be fixed soon.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want to get rid of it you could recompile the plugin DLL you use and add some extra resource file, e.g. an icon, change some version info , UPX it etc. etc... The signature would not be of spyware anymore.<br />
