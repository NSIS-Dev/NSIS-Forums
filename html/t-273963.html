      <p class="post-content"><strong>Why Doesn't This Script Work for me</strong><br />
      This script is doing two things first of all it is searching for a specific registry key to get the install path and also making sure that the program this addon is inteded for is installed, this part of the script works without problems.<br />
      <br />
      The Second part is using the Processes plugin to see if this program is running, if the program is found to be running $R0 should return 1 and halt on the message i have created for some reason it does not and I cant figure out why. I'm hoping its a simple error on my part that one of you will beable to find and help me correct.<br />
      <br />
      Function .onInit<br />
      ReadRegStr $R1 HKLM "SOFTWARE\Program Manufacturer\Program To Search For\" "InstallPath"<br />
      <br />
      StrCmp $R1 "" ProgNotFound ProgFound<br />
      <br />
      ProgNotFound:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "The Program this installer needs is not installed on this computer. You must install it to continue with this installation."<br />
      Quit<br />
      <br />
      ProgFound:<br />
      loop:<br />
      Processes::FindProcess "Prog"<br />
      StrCmp $R0 1 0 done<br />
      <br />
      MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "The Program this installer needs is running on this computer. You must close it to continue with this installation."<br />
      Quit<br />
      <br />
      done:<br />

      <p class="post-content">It seems that it doesn't find the process, did you try to debug your script with a message box to see what $R0 contains in that stage?<br />
      What is the loop label about?<br />
      <br />
      You may want to give a try to FCT plugin as well,<br />
