However when I change users to just an ordinary user as the application is loading I get the Windows error dialog box appearing. The normal one asking the user to send mesaage to microsoft. The application exits when I cancel the error box. Can anyone help me understand what may be causing this. I use the setShellContextVar all to set the application to all users. Any advice would be great as I dont fully understand what is causing this.<br><br><br>Many thanks :confused:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th November 2006 14:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">What exactly does the dialog box say?

If so, try a vanilla version of NSIS instead of a privately built version. If that really solves the problem, I'd need a full script reproducing this problem and the build options you've used so I can fix the incompatibility with VS2005.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">f1nn</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd November 2006 12:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hi Kichik,<br>Riverdocs.exe is the installer and I am usign a standard MUI setup script. I have found that it is a permissions problem, If the install folder C:\Program Files\ MY APP is read only this causes the problem. If it is not read only it appears to be ok. I have been trying to setFileAttributes to set the attributes to normal what I am trying to doing is, using the NSIS get parent function get the Riverdocs folder as the parent, if I check this $R0 is C:\Program Files\Riverdocs I then use the getfile Attributes command like this ${GetFileAttributes} "C:\Program Files\RiverDocs" "ALL" $Var Then I am hoping to use setfileAttributes $var normal I thought I could have just used the setfileattributes command with out the getfileattributes. would that be OK. When I use the getfilesattributes command I get the error invalid command. I have used !include "FileFunc.nsh"<br>would that be right? or do I need to insert anything else. I am proberly not using thse commands right and have tryed to follow them to the letter from the help documentation so can you explain where I am going wrong. It is not the best solution to make the folder writable rather than read only but should work as a temporary fix, would apprecipate your help on this,<br><br>Many thanks<br><br>N</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd November 2006 18:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I'm sorry, I have misread your original post. You said it was your program that crashed when switching to a normal user and not the installer.<br><br>That's a problem with your program which probably tries to write the Program Files directory and doesn't check for failure. When running under a normal user, you can't write to that folder and shouldn't be able to. You shouldn't set the permissions to enable this. Instead, you should modify your program so it uses the Application Data directory. To get that directory, use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shgetspecialfolderlocation.asp?frame=true" target="_blank">SHGetSpecialFolderLocation</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shgetfolderpath.asp?frame=true" target="_blank">SHGetFolderPath</a> with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=30340" target="_blank">shfolder.dll</a>.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
