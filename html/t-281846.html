      <p class="post-content"><strong>Creating files with batch scripts</strong><br />
      Hello everybody,<br />
      <br />
      I was having so many troubles reading the exit codes from my batch scripts that I decided to go a different way. I changed the scripts so they now make a dummy text file (using echo and redirect "&gt;") if they ran successfully and don't make the file if they had an error. In the installer / uninstaller I want to just test for the presence of the file.<br />
      <br />
      The scripts will create the files fine when I run them from the command line but don't create the file when I call them from the installer. Anybody have any thoughts about why this is happening? Or suggestions to get the files written. I am not an expert in either batch or NSIS so there could be any number of things wrong.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">Because you must use the command line processor - cmd.exe or command.com. It's the only process that parses input/output redirection. When normally creating processes on Windows with CreateProcess, those won't work and will be considered part of the arguments.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I changed the scripts from .bat to .cmd to ensure they were run with cmd.exe, and I am using ExecWait to call the scripts so I think I am avoiding the CreateProcess problems that occur with !execute and !system. Is there something else that I am missing?</p>

      <p class="post-content">!execute and !system are compile time commands. They won't cause the script to run on the user's system.</p>
