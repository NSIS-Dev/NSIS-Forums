Instead of just bitching, you could provide some more info about this corruption and a minimal sample script that reproduces it (And if you are real fucking lucky, I might even spend some of my time looking at it, but insulting me is not exactly the best way to get your issue to the top of the pile)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">trixom</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th October 2008 09:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Look, Dude..., If you respond with a one liner, don't expect people to react nicely.
