Say, for example, they are installed like this:<br><br>C:\Eclipse_1\eclipse.exe<br>C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe<br><br>Say, both of these are running. If I write<br><br>FindProcDLL::FindProc "C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe"<br><br>it returns 0 (which means it hasn't found a process called "C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe").<br><br>What I need to be able to kill all Eclipse processes that were launched from "C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe". I am not allowed to killed anything launched from "C:\Eclipse_1\eclipse.exe".<br><br>The reason I have to do it this way is that our installer installs some Eclipse plug-ins for the user. The user might well have elected to have several Eclipse installations anyhow, so for our uninstaller, we need to make sure that only the "correct" Eclipse's are killed in order to safely uninstall the plug-ins.<br><br>The point is I need to do more than just identify a process by it's .exe name: I need to identify a process by its .exe path including the .exe name!<br><br>So either I am going nuts, or FindProcDLL doesn't do what I need it to!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th August 2007 17:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can use the LockedList plug-in for this.
