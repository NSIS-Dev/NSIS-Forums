      <p class="post-content">This is not plug-in problem :)<br>
      I took bdfy script and did following:<br>
      1. Carefully replaced ExecWait calls with ExecDos. After this all black screens dissapeared.<br>
      2. Added MessageBoxes showing application exit codes.<br>
      3. According to exit codes found and fixed suspicious places in the original code, like this - program extracts file to current SetOutPath dir, but tries to start program from another one<br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>  SetOutPath "$INSTDIR\resistance"<br>  File  "Files\bat\Resdelete.bat"<br>  ExecWait "$INSTDIR\Resdelete.bat"<br></code>
</pre><br>
      Now exit codes of 3 runs are 0, 1 and 1; resistance.pbo file size changed, looks working. Full script sent by email.<br>
      <br>
      2 Anders: XP&amp;2K - no problem, but on Win98 it's a real head pain... In my tests hidden Winoldapps on Win98 remain in Ctrl-Alt-Del list and create problem on next reboot :(

      <p class="post-content">Oh, thank you.<br>
      I was hoping it would work somewhat similar to a 'live output' that the logfile option does.<br>
      Would make it easier to handle live output internally by NSIS rather than reading from the logfile.<br>
      <br>
      I was wondering... Since you have already successfully redirected live output to a logfile, is it possible for you to redirect it to the details box?<br>
      <br>
      I have a external application that needs to run during install. It outputs it's progress as dots:<br>
      "............" and so on, untill it reaches:<br>
      ".............................. DONE."<br>
      <br>
      ExecToLog is unable to do it. It was discussed allot in this thread:<br>
      <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?&amp;threadid=126972" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....hreadid=126972</a><br>
      <br>
      But no solution was found.<br>
      <br>
      If it can't be done, I guess I can resort to /ASYNC, and have a loop reading from the file every 1/2 a second or so..<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hello, I'm hoping this is the appropriate thread to ask this question...<br>
      <br>
      I am in the process of converting to the unicode NSIS installer and I am using ExecDos. I had to change several other plugins to get it to work, but ExecDos seems to be okay. Can you tell me whether it is Unicode compliant or it is just lucky that no inputs have broken it yet? If it is not Unicode compliant, is there a recommended solution?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for your help!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Current version of ExecDos (July 2007) looks multibyte only. Unfortunately I have not NSIS Unicode installed now, so attached variant is 100% <b>not tested</b>. I just replaced char-&gt;TCHAR and added unicode release/debug configurations.<br>
      Just found - last string output /towindow and /tofinc may not work if it is not terminated with '\n' - require some code like this is done for /tostack :(. And one more - plug-in creates process using Unicode syscall, but I am not sure that catched output from CLI application (redirected to pipes) will be Unicode as well.<br>
      Have fun ;).</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Regarding ExecDos</strong><br>
      hi all,<br>
      <br>
      I am attaching a python executable with NSIS. The runtime prints of python's windows executable is needed to be outputed on the showdetails field of NSIS's Installation Page. We are using ExecDos dll, plugins to display runtime output of python's windows executable (hello.exe). The code snippet is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      ExecDos::exec /NOUNLOAD /ASYNC /DETAILED /TIMEOUT=10000 "hello.exe"<br>
      Pop $0<br>
      ExecDos::wait $0<br>
      <br>
      where hello.exe is window's executable of hello.py,<br>
      hello.py is:<br>
      <br>
      import os, time, sys<br>
      import WConio<br>
      print "something is running ....."<br>
      sys.stdout.flush()<br>
      x = WConio.wherex()<br>
      y = WConio.wherey()<br>
      WConio.gotoxy(x+50,y-1)<br>
      time.sleep(10)<br>
      print "ok"<br>
      sys.stdout.flush()<br>
      <br>
      "Console window" Output of above hello.exe is:<br>
      <br>
      something is running ...... ok<br>
      <br>
      But when hello exe is used in NSIS, the display looks like this:<br>
      <br>
      something is running .......<br>
      ok<br>
      <br>
      My intention is to get the print like as shown for Console window, ie 'ok' on the same line. Can anyone suggest what I am doing wrong? NOTE that when I use the ',' after the first print, the string is buffered even if I do a flush (as sys.stdout.flush()).</p>

      <p class="post-content">gotoxy() sounds like terminal command. First print() sends CR, but after this you move marker back to previous line. None of NSIS plug-ins supports terminal emulation.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Reason of using gotoxy(), is to set the cursor position, as my intention is to print<br>
      Something is running........(sleep for 10, then print)..Ok<br>
      <br>
      using below code:<br>
      <br>
      print "Something is running.....",<br>
      sys.stdout.flush()<br>
      sys.sleep(10)<br>
      print "Ok"<br>
      sys.stdout.flush()<br>
      <br>
      sys.stdout.flush(), is not working with "comma", it buffers "Something is running....." with "Ok" string and throw result on showdetails window after 10.<br>
      Can you suggest the way to make flush to work with ","?</p>

        * Added Unicode build (just noticed there was already a Unicode build in this thread but never mind - this version has been tested at least).<br>
        * Uses new plug-in API (/NOUNLOAD not necessary with /ASYNC).<br>
        * Added /DISABLEFSR switch to disable WOW64 file system redirection on Windows x64 for the internal ExecDos thread (the old version would fail if the executable was in system32).<br>

        <p class="post-content">Afrow, I noticed that the log files are encoded in UTF-8. Is there anyway to change that to UTF16-LE?<br>
        <br>
        I'm writing a piece of code at the moment, and I'm trying to read Unicode characters into the stack, via an external file. I'm using the NSIS Unicode build at the moment.<br>
        <br>
        I have tried executing to function instead of out to log, but it seems that only outputting it out to the log keeps the Unicode characters as they are.<br>
        <br>
        I can think of only a few ways to do this, like a FileRead that works for UTF-8 (Using FileRead screws up the characters, and FileReadUTF16LE is no better.)<br>
        <br>
        Another alternative is to stick of course, with FileReadUTF16LE, but the file has to be encoded in UTF-16 LE as well, if not it also becomes a garbled mess.<br>
        <br>
        I know it may seem like asking for much, but would you happen to know any way around this?</p>
