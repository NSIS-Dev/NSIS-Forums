      Hi dudes...<br />
      Why not, instead of the zip file, make a compiled exe of NSIS?<br />
      This in latest dev snapshot...<br />
      Will be easy to install....</p>

      <p class="post-content">you cannot do that unless they make a Linux version NSIS andthe makensisw.exe and make the !InstallNSIS.bat into a !InstallNSIS.sh file for linux to auto execute<br />
      <br />
      Files Hosted on SourceForge which inturn is Hosted/Based on Unix/Linux :P<br />
      <br />
      or if SoruceForge was running Wine/Winex maybe ( doubt it as it only emulates a few Windows stuff properly) they could maybe do it<br />
      <br />
      as i imagine that they are having the Server Side doing nightly zipped to automate things<br />
      <br />
      as if someone was doing it manualy then yes they could but thats annoying that they would have to always be uploading the file everynight</p>

      <p class="post-content">Doesn't the "update" button on the NSIS menu effectively do this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes the update button downloads the CVS version and merges the changes and updates to ur copy of NSIS but u have to have NSIS installed anyway or u at least have to have the NSIS nightly.zip extracted and on ur pc.<br />
      <br />
      Update button = NSISUpdate.exe in NSIS\Bin</p>

      <p class="post-content">I post this because...<br />
      most of us, don't need the source code...<br />
      that could speed up the download...</p>

      <p class="post-content">The source code is included in the installer too, downloading an installer won't speed up anything. SourceForge servers run Linux, don't have Wine and prohibit compiling, so this is a no go.</p>
