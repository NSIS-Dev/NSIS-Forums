      <p class="post-content"><strong>Force text to use ClearType antialiasing method</strong><br />
      Hi!<br />
      <br />
      I would like to know how (or if it is at all possible) to force a static text control to be antialiased using ClearType under WinXP and up.<br />
      <br />
      In C I'd do something like:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>LOGFONT MyLogFont;<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />MyLogFont.lfQuality = CLEARTYPE_QUALITY;</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      But how would I be able to do the same thing using NSIS? Could I use the font handle from a CreateFont command for something?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.<br />
      <br />
      Brad.

      <p class="post-content">You'd have to write a plug-in or use the System plug-in to create your own font handle.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi!<br />
      <br />
      It has been over a couple of months since I posted about this, but am still having immense trouble getting anything close to working. Not wanting to write a plugin, I'm wanting to create my own font handle using the System plugin to do what this C code does:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>LOGFONT lf;<br />memset(&amp;lf, 0, sizeof(lf));<br />lf.lfQuality = CLEARTYPE_QUALITY;<br />lf.lfHeight = -32;<br />strcpy(lf.lfFaceName, "Verdana");<br />HFONT hFont = CreateFontIndirect(&amp;lf);</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Is there any possiblity that someone could please provide an example on how to do this?<br />
      <br />
      Many thanks in advance,<br />
      <br />
      Brad.

      <p class="post-content">It's mainly for the welcome page and header texts that lay over bitmaps, that would look so much better anti-aliased. (And the text of course is dynamic, so that's why I haven't done the obvious by making the text part of the bitmap.)<br />
      <br />
      Your expertise would be greatly appreciated! ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow! That was quick!<br />
      Thanks again, Anders! NSIS wouldn't be what it is without the outstanding support from people such as yourself! :D</p>
