      <p class="post-content">You can't. It's code inside makensis which is invoked for very specific reasons during compilation. For example, your installer only uses some of the page types so makensis decides you don't need the resources for the others and removes them. Or you turn XPStyle on, makensis adds an XP manifest into your installer binary. The code that does these things is not available to you directly.<br>
      <br>
      If you are still interested in the code look in CVS or your NSIS folder at source/ResourceEditor.cpp.</p>
