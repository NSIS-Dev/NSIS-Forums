      is there a way to make makensis.exe use both cores? is this planned for the future?<br />

      </blockquote>well, it's not dual core because the task manager shows it's only using one. And using dual cores would speed up compressing.<br />

      </blockquote>ok, it's not simple, but it may help that 7-zip already does multi-threaded lzma compression.

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm, we have just gone from dual core to threads :igor:. Yeah, it shouldn't be too hard to add support to NSIS to compress using two threads (if hyperthreading or dual processors is available).</p>

      <p class="post-content">If testing your script is the speed problem of makensis use something along the lines off:<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      !define IWANTTODEBUG<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      !ifdef IWANTTODEBUG<br />
      SetCompressor off<br />
      !else<br />
      SetCompress lzma<br />
      !endif<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      this will speed up your script development a lot...</p>

      <p class="post-content">It won't have to be re-written to be multi-threaded anyway, as AMD's Reverse Hyper-Threading which will be released through Windows Update will allow one thread to use both processors in a dual-processor CPU. That is what I've read anyway ;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">hi,<br />
      last post here was from last year and there were a lot of changes since then. i recognize with amd fx cpu and vista 32-bit that the compiler still not use both cores. according to taskmanager it stops at 50% which is one of two cores.<br />
      <br />
      is there a planning for bring support for multiple cores, maybe in next release of nsis?<br />
      <br />
      think about how fast the compiler could be on a quad core machine.. :D</p>

      Making the entire compiler multithreaded would require much more work. It's planned, but there are a lot of plans.</p>

      </blockquote>That's unfortunate. With all of the multi-core boxes out there, I think this would be a great feature. I regularly compile installers with 100+ MB of source files, and it's sad to have three of my four cores idle when doing so.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Try using CopyFiles, SetCompress off, or building "skeleton" installers that include all the logic but don't actually install any data. I tend to go with the skeleton installers, to reduce disk I/O and make the actual installation process go faster as well as the compilation.<br />
