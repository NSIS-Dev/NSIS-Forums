      <p class="post-content"><strong>Custom Dialogs</strong><br />
      I was just wondering how easy it would be<br />
      to create custom dialogs in the installer.<br />
      Right now, I'm using the modern UI. I would like to create an entirely new set of dialogs that are, in a way, skinned. I realize that I'd have to create them in C++, but that's cool. Is there a spec I can follow for resource and dialog names? Is there any tutorial out there for doing such a thing?<br />
      <br />
      What my company wants is a fully skinned installer, which means the dialog wouldn't even look like a typical windows dialog. The buttons would be skinned, and so would the min/max/close buttons.<br />
      <br />
      thanks,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, as far as I know, to skin a window you have to respond to Windows messages such as WM_PAINT and paint it yourself. For that, you can create a plug-in that will take over the windows procedure of NSIS and load it using /NOUNLOAD. You'll also have to know whenever a new dialog or a button is created and take over those too. I won't call it easy, but not much harder than regular skinning either. This has never been done as far as I know, and so there aren't any tutorials or examples available. If you do this eventually I would love seeing the results. If you need any help with creating the plug-in, or even changing the source code if you find it easier don't hesitate to ask.</p>

      <p class="post-content">dark_boy, you need to respond to ${WM_PAINT} not send it, and you can't do that without a plug-in. To set the font you need to send ${WM_SETFONT}.</p>
