Is there a way of conditionally creating a shortcut depending on the instalation or not of a section ?<br>I already found a workaround to this by testing the existence of some files/directories in the target directory<br>but I was wondering if there is a cleaner way of doing it.<br><br>What I'm actually thinking is to have some sort of instalation information file, that keeps the state<br>of the instalation as long as the application is installed.<br><br>Think if you need to install a file only if a section is selected by the user, but also to the fact that<br>when you uninstall you should delete the file (or perform some other operation on that file).<br><br>It will be useful to be able to know at uninstall time what sections the user chose so that you perform<br>an action conditionally. I know there is a workaround here also, by writing values to the registry, but<br>I was wondering how difficult will be to keep an ini file containing the full installation process:<br>type of the instalation the user chose, the files that were copied, etc.; and this file should be easily<br>access by some functions of NSIS. You shouldn't even have to tell which file to save these settings to,<br>it should use a default one in the same dir as the uninstall executable.<br><br><br>2. Will there be any support for if/else conditional statements ? I know you can do it with labels<br>but for a larger script the script code becomes unclear (I know I'm picky)<br>and if you were to do this, some sort of boolean expresion have to be implemented, I mean<br>IfFileExists should change to a boolean command like ( if (FileExists..... )<br>but that's probably for version 3.0 :)<br><br><br>3. Can you add the $USERHOME variable that will represent the user's folder ? I know about the "Shell Folders"<br>registry key but this one is not in there and some applications may need to store information in that folder.<br>I personally needed that and had to do a small app in C++ that gets it and writes it in an INI file<br>and then let the script use it. It's a big hassle to do this easy task as you can imagine,<br>but i did it for lack of a better method. Shouldn't be to difficult to add even in version 2.0 (*hint, hint*)<br><br><br>4. Will the string functions expand ? One way of getting the user home dir can be to do some string<br>operations on other shell folder paths but the string functions of NSIS are more than limited.<br>I mean you only have StrCpy and StrLen so far. Some regular expression would be nice ;)<br><br><br>5. Is there a way of performing an action if a section is NOT installed ?<br>if not can you extend the syntax of the script to accept something similar to:<br><br>Section "Blah blah"<br>; commands to execute when the section is selected<br>SectionNot<br>; commands to execute when the section is NOT selected<br>SectionEnd<br><br>if SectionNot is missing than it behaves just as now<br><br><br>6. Can you revert the way Section and SubSection work ? I mean it seems more natural to me to write<br><br>Section "Papa"<br>SubSection "Kiddy 1"<br>SubSectionEnd<br><br>SubSection "Kiddy 2"<br>SubSectionEnd<br><br>SectionEnd<br><br>rather than<br><br>SubSection "Papa"<br>Section "Kiddy 1"<br>SectionEnd<br><br>Section "Kiddy 2"<br>SectionEnd<br><br>SubSectionEnd<br><br>I mean a section has sub sections not the other way around.<br><br><br>7. Is there a way to display a tiny window center in front of the install window (like InstallShield does<br>when it has some components to register, etc. generally when the delay is not due to the install program)<br>that has no decorations (just a gray little window with a centered text, no titlebar, no nothing)<br><br>if not, can you put it ? :)<br><br><br>8. Can you expand the documentation to describe in more details how one can create his own skin,<br>I mean some details about modern.exe format, even if it will be only for C++ programmers.<br>Can you for example use non rectangular windows, or transparent ones ?<br><br><br>9. Can you expand the file functions ? I'm reffering to the posibility to modify an existing file<br>without having to rewrite it all.<br>Some line base functions (for text files) that can replace only a specified line would really make a difference.<br><br><br>That's about it, sorry if it seems i want to much from a free product but only want to make it better.<br>I've use it in several projects and I find it invaluable. I'm planning to start myself some of these things<br>when I finish my current project.<br><br>Awaiting for your oppinions.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Chris</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th December 2002 15:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">1. Just put it in the section... If you want to create it in another section use SectionGetFlags to know if the section is selected.<br><br>Nothing is stopping you from writing an INI file using <a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/NSIS/Docs/Chapter3.html#3.7.2" target="_blank">INI file manipulation functions</a> and reading it in the uninstaller.<br><br>2. NSIS 3 ;)<br><br>3. What's USERHOME? And how do you get it without the registry?<br><br>Instead of writing a program that writes to an INI file you should have written a plug-in to just push to the NSIS stack... Have a look at Contrib\ExDLL for an example.<br><br>4. There is nothing you can't do with StrCpy (that takes more than 2 parmaters) and StrLen.<br><br>5. Again, SectionGetFlags should do the trick.<br><br>6. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=624789&amp;group_id=22049&amp;atid=373088" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index...49&amp;atid=373088</a><br><br>It's being considered.<br><br>7.

I think that there are quite a few things that can't be covered by StrCpy, for example how do you split a string by the last occurence of a char ('\' most probably for paths) ? StrCpy can copy substring to variables but how do you find the index of the char ?<br><br>8. ok, but can I create a different executable that has the exact same resources with the same settings (IDs and everything) but with different positions for the controls ? will that work only by modifing or creating a new modern.exe ?<br><br>9. thx for the link (please no RTFM ;) or FAQ in this case )<br>can you tell me if NSIS's file functions handle UTF(unicode) files correctly ?<br><br><br><br><br>Keep up the good work :up: ,<br>it's much appreciated<br><br>Btw, do you plan do implement a patch maker that will integrate somehow with NSIS, or at least share the same interface and script language ?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th December 2002 19:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can do everything you want with loops and StrCpy.
