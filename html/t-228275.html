      <p class="post-content">No real significance in the names.<br>
      The "Main" section is the default section generated by the EclipseNSIS wizard. It is set to be hidden by default (which is why it has the "-" prefix). You can change its name to anything you wish in the wizard Installer Contents page and make it visible if you wish.<br>
      The "post" section is generated behind the scenes by EclipseNSIS wizard. It is used to perform any essential &amp; required post-installation tasks. Again, it is hidden which is why it has the "-" prefix.<br>
      The reason the registry strings are set is so that the uninstaller knows that it should uninstall anything that was installed in that section.<br>
      A registry string is set for every section which appears in the Installer Contents page.<br>
      That way the user can choose whichever section(s) she/he wishes to install and the uninstaller knows what it has to uninstall.<br>
      The wizard is targeted at the novice NSIS developer- as a convenient way to quickly create a working NSIS installer. More accomplished users can then tweak and tune the resulting script as much as they wish.<br>
      <br>
      BTW, the ${BCS_REGKEY} in your <b>Section un.Main</b> doesn't look right to me. Unless it is defined to be the same as ${REGKEY} you are going to wind up with residual entries in the registry after uninstallation.<br>
      <br>
      If you can provide more details of the exact problems you are facing with the script, I am sure you will get plenty of help in this forum.</p>

      </blockquote>Good catch ... carelessness on my part writing the post. It is not still that way in the actual script.<br>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>My impression is that the wizard generates these statements for uninstalling, but further modifications can cause this to get "out of sync" ... or does the EclipsePlugin keep track of this?

      Once the script is created you are on your own. :)</p>
