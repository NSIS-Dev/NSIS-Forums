It was developed by a frequent poster here, Red Wine, and he often provides lots of good help to newbies.<br><br>Since your problem script didn't get attached to your post, we can't provide specific advice about compile errors (or anything else either). I will give you two tips 1) if you have any logic at all in your script, use the logiclib header. And 2) NSIS scripts are processed by a 'one-pass' compiler and the order of items (functions, sections, pages) in the script is critical. The NSIS QSSG will create a good template (or finished installer) that you can edit to do exactly what you want it to do.<br><br>Don</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd May 2007 18:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Or ZIP you nsi file and upload it here :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">helix400</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd May 2007 22:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Re: **can any one give a newbe a little help!!</strong><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by bow9487</i><br><b>i have got it to compile once but it didnt run, i spent 16 hours on it lastnight, got up first thing couldnt wait to have a go,but at half 12 last night and nothing working i got a little downheartend,</b></blockquote>Hey, I'm just proud that you worked that hard on a problem. :)</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bow9487</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd May 2007 15:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">thanks guys for posting back ill upload my work to a rapidshare folder in a bit ask is to big to post on here. if you could have a look id be graitfull.<br><br>i have put every thing in a rar file as i dont no what you mite need, its only 3mb<br><br>link<br><br><a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/29266944/help.rar.html" target="_blank">http://rapidshare.com/files/29266944/help.rar.html</a><br><br>thanks all</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd May 2007 16:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">err....nsi file, not all your project files :\</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bow9487</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">4th May 2007 11:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">hey joel like i said im new to all this and like i said in my last post, i have put every thing in a rar file AS I DONT NO what you mite need<br><br>just so its clear im new to all this in my first post i did say iv never done this befor so i wouldnt no what was needed for you to help me, thats why i uploaded it all, as its very small i didnt think it would be a problem</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">4th May 2007 19:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by bow9487</i><br><b>hey joel like i said im new to all this and like i said in my last post, i have put every thing in a rar file AS I DONT NO what you mite need</b></blockquote><a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=2180516#post2180516" target="_blank">As i said to you</a>, WE ONLY NEED NSI FILE.. :rolleyes:<br><blockquote>just so its clear im new to all this in my first post i did say iv never done this befor so i wouldnt no what was needed for you to help me, thats why i uploaded it all, as its very small i didnt think it would be a problem [/B]</blockquote>Again, we only need the NSI File to see what's wrong..
