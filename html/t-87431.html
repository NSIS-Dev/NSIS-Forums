      <p class="post-content">I would use it if I actually completed any of my programs. I have a few abandoned projects lying around. But I will use Slateblue to compile the script when I finish something.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have the source, I have the source ... or is it a make believe source because it came to me when I downloaded the program.<br />
      <br />
      But SlateBlue (from beginning to present) has always been there when ever I was compiling my script. That simple.<br />
      <br />
      Props to Liquid for a great IDE that still needs a little work.<br />
