Here's a list of changes so you can decide if you want to download it.<br><br>1. The "Completed" text can now be specified in the new project wizard.<br>2. The text on the "Show Details" button can now be set in the new project wizard.<br>3. ! directives have been added to the function list. Double clicking on the ! in the functions list now displays a pick list of available directives. Alternately you can type !. in the script window<br>4. If the Compiler Output is currently being displayed and you select Quick Help the help page is now displayed.<br>5. The functions from functions.htm have been added to the code snippets.<br>6. Code templates !if (expands to !if !endif) and !ife (expands to !if !else !endif) have been added.<br>7. Code snippets are now inserted so that they only require one Undo to remove them, previously you had to do an Undo for each line of the code snippet.<br>8. Undo toolbar button and menu item now become disabled when there is no more to undo.<br>9. The first function per letter in the function list is now highlighted in bold by default. This can turned off via the options screen.<br>10. Added incremental function search edit box above function list. Once the required function has been found it can be inserted in to the script editor by pressing Enter. Pressing Esc clears the entry, it is also automatically cleared when it receives focus (is entered). It's keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+1.<br><br>Available from the usual URL<br><br>Marc</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Kreft</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th November 2001 22:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>whered he go george?!?</strong><br>the link is down :(</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mkeeley</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th November 2001 22:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Try now.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">eccles</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th November 2001 00:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I like the incremental search :) but I don't see the '!' in the functions list..<br><br>Dave.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mkeeley</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th November 2001 00:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Must have forgot to copy the new functions table over to my release folder.
