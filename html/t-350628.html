      <p class="post-content"><strong>How can make NSIS to download and run a file without user intervention?</strong><br />
      Hi there,<br />
      <br />
      I am new to NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      My installation would like to give the user a selection of available components and each component links to an installation from my website. When the selection is made, I would like NSIS to download the files and run them without any user intervention.<br />
      <br />
      1) The checksum of these files should be verified at the end of the download against a checksum log from my website, such as a TXT file<br />
      2) These files need to be run at a certain order, not just FIFO style<br />
      3) These files should be stored in a temp directory by default so that they won't take up resource when the installation is finished<br />
      4) Before the actual download, the user can request to save these files to an user directory so that they can transfer them to another PC<br />
      <br />
      Can someone be so kind to give me some pointers on how to get this done?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a lot!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi saxe,<br />
      <br />
      I'm a noob too, but some hints are better than nothing, right?<br />
      <br />
      1) I saw this earlier: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/MD5_plugin" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/MD5_plugin</a><br />
      You can create the md5 checksum of a file and compare it to your text files. Reading from files is very well described in the NSIS help. To compare you can use StrCmp.<br />
      <br />
      2) If the order depends on the chosen components, you can create a hidden section (that always gets executed) behind the other sections and use<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>${If} ${SectionIsSelected} ${section_name}<br />...<br />${EndIf}<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      to egt some order. Requires logiclib.nsh<br />
      <br />
      3) NSIS uses the temporary folder when I execute my installer, maybe it saves downloads to %temp% too? Did you check that? You can use a tool like FolderChangesView from NirSoft to do that. otherwise the constant $Temp may help.<br />
      <br />
      4) You can use a custom pre-function to ask if the files should be saved right before the install page is opened. See chapter 4.5.3 Callbacks in NSIS help. Use a message box to ask the user if the files should be saved and if so let him choose a folder to save to.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck :)

      <p class="post-content">1) Use the md5 plugin to create the md5 hash, and use the inetc or other download plugin to download a (text)file with the correct md5 hash in it. (Or create a php script that sends the md5hash for a requested filename.)<br />
      2) Sections are executed in the order that they appear in your .nsi script.<br />
      3) $PLUGINSDIR is your friend.<br />
      4) Create a custom page with nsDialogs, that offers the user a choice between temp or selected folder. There's an excellent tutorial in the nsDialogs readme. <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the reply.<br />
      <br />
      How about pointers to how to download a file from website and execute it? If codes are too much to ask, please give me a few key words so that I can use them to search this website.<br />
      <br />
      I want to create a simple one to see how it works first<br />
      <br />
      Again, thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know it's possible, but I don't know where it is written down. You could search this site <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/List_of_all_pages_in_NSIS_repository#String_Functions" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/List_of_...ring_Functions</a> for web installtion or similar terms.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I guess I can use the codes like this:<br />

      Pop $R0 ;Get the return value<br />
      StrCmp $R0 "success" +3<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK "Download failed: $R0"<br />
      Quit<br />
      <br />
      exec localfile.exe</p>
