      LANGUAGE FILES HAVE TO BE UPDATED! -<br />
      yes i was subscribed to this thread but I was getting a log a language XX was uploaded... but I don't need that all I need is an notification like this: language files format was changed to version X please submit your new language files.<br />
      <br />
      I want to keep the Romanian translation and to be notified when I have something to do not when someboady update his language.<br />
      <br />
      I think this is why at this moment we have Arabic translation only at version V2 instead of V6 - because the guy that made it unsubscribed from the thread because he was receiving a lot of emails.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You are listed to the translation mailing list. You should get an e-mail about changes to the language files requesting your update. Didn't you get an e-mail requesting it?<br />
      <br />
      The Arabic translator is listed to that list too.</p>
