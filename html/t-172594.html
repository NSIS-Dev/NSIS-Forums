      <p class="post-content"><strong>Odd section selection behaviour?</strong><br />
      Hello Everyone,<br />
      <br />
      I've been using these selection things for quite some time now on the components page, but for some reason I keep experiencing really odd behaviour. I have attached a very simple script that reproduces many odd things listed below. I have also listed below the functionality I am after. If anyone could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      All selection of subsections appears to be fine if i select/deselect from the children, it's the top down I can't get to work properly<br />
      <br />
      ODD Things:<br />
      1. Compile and run the script.<br />
      2a. Expand Application, deselect the application checkbox twice, this deslects all the subsections which is fine, click it again however, and it doesn't reselect them. I thought that part of the functionality was supposed to be handled by windows?<br />
      2b. Restart, expand Application, deselect client, that's as expected, now try to deselect server, why doesn't this work? I haven't coded anything special so why doesn't it work like the client option?<br />
      <br />
      What I am after:<br />
      1. Ability to Install client as a seperate piece.<br />
      - by selecting/deselecting it from the client subsection level (currently works)<br />
      2. Ability to install server as a seperate piece.<br />
      - by selecting/deselecting it from the server subsection level (currently doesn't work)<br />
      3. Select or deselect the application level (yeah I know, I then trap to make sure a section is selected ;)) but this is for consistency. If you click application a few times it nolonger changes either....odd.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers,<br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Nope, Windows doesn't not handle such complex operations. It is mostly privately written code, which seems like it needs a nice rewrite.
