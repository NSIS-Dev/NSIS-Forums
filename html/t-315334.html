      <p class="post-content"><strong>ARJ Extraction ?</strong><br />
      I'm writing an installer that needs to extract a few arj files at the end. How would this be done?<br />
      <br />
      I'm guessing with a DOS unarj utility executed through a plugin like ExecDOS? Anyone have any example code that might help me understand this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd use the 7zip command-line: <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">http://www.7-zip.org/download.html</a><br />
      <br />
      SetOutPath "$PLUGINSDIR"<br />
      File 7za.exe<br />
      <br />
      nsExec::Exec '"$PLUGINSDIR\7za.exe" x "&lt;path to archive&gt;" -y -o"&lt;extraction path&gt;"'<br />
      <br />
      Extracting the files and including them in your installer might also work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Unfortunately this specific arj archive can't be opened with the command line version of 7zip, and including them in the installer is not an option.<br />
      <br />
      The archive can be opened with unarj, but the program is very limited (it will only extract the files to the directory it is in).<br />
      <br />
      The following works for me in Windows XP, but not in Vista. I have RequestExecutionLevel admin set.<br />
      <br />
      Section -UNARJ<br />
      SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
      nsExec::execToLog '"$INSTDIR\unarj.exe" x REDNECK.INS'<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      On Vista it seems to just skip running the program as I get no feedback from it in the log. Any ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think I just figured it out. I'm running a 64 bit version of Windows Vista which unarj is not compatible with.<br />
      <br />
      I can think of a few workarounds, but none of them are very good... As I would like the install process to do everything automatically for the end user.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try the command-line included with WinRAR (not their DOS one listed as a separate download). It's not a free program so I don't know if you would be allowed to include it in your installer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could also try unrar.dll through the system plugin, but I never figured out how to make that work. If I remember correctly, I was unable to find documentation for the dll. Also I can't remember whether it's a free redistributable or not.<br />
      <br />
      Probably a better idea is to try unarj32.dll. It's Japanese, but it should be relatively well documented even in English.</p>
