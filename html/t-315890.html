That is for all of:<br>- directory and files<br>- start menu shortcuts and groups<br>- registry keys<br><br>That is my files live in<br>$PROGRAMFILES\Company\Program Group\Program Name\<br>the registry keys live in<br>HKCU\Software\Company\Program Group\Program Name\<br>and the Start Menu Shortcuts live in<br>$SMPROGRAMS\Company\Program Group\Program Name\<br><br>Now if after I remove my application the program group is left emtpy I want to also delete the program group directory.<br>If after that the compnay directory (in Program Files) is left emtpy I want to delete that too.<br><br>Problem is I delete files with /REBOOTOK flag so files might be still present even after my Delete instruction. How can I then check if the directory would be left emtpy after reboot, so I can RMDir /REBOOTOK ?<br><br>Thank you,<br>Timothy Madden</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st December 2009 19:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well, If I was making that installer, I would do the following<br><br>1.- Uninstaller adds a Registry entry @ RunOnce<br>2.- Use a tool that would uses <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Check_if_dir_is_empty" target="_blank">this</a>.<br>3.- You can also check again <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.9.1.8" target="_blank">RmDir</a>, you can remove the folder if is empty.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">LoRd_MuldeR</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">1st January 2010 18:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">madden, look here:<br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Recursively_remove_empty_parent_directories" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Recursiv...nt_directories</a></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">madden</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">4th January 2010 16:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I know how to check for emtpy directories and remove them as long as files are not in use.

What if the user postpones the reboot and immediately re-installs the application ?

Assuming that /REBOOTOK delted files are removed during the boot process <i>before</i> RunOnce applications are started. So if the user did re-install application between uninstall and reboot, nothing bad would happen...<br><br>Or even uglier: Let your installer remove a pending clean-up from RunOnce, if present :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">madden</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">4th January 2010 18:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Excelent plug-in!<br>Thank you.<br><br>Looking for something like this I used KillProc to check if my executable is running while installing/uninstalling and killing it myself. But of course this would solve only most part of the problem and not all. LockedList is indeed the solution to my /REBOOTOK problem, but I still have the feeling it is possible to run into some system file that can not be so easily installed without /REBOOTOK ...<br><br>Thank you,<br>Timothy Madden</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
