      <p class="post-content"><strong>A very newbie question indeed!</strong><br />
      Hello experts,<br />
      <br />
      Do you know where to find a book about NSIS? I just need somthing that I coud study -- the easiest approach to learning the BASICS to the very ADVANCED topics.<br />
      <br />
      Any useful and helpful link other than the FAQ, examples and tutorials in the official site shall be much appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      Google Search doesnt always give me the right information I need. The documentation doesnt provide a step by step tutorial as well. It is a better thing to include such in future releases.<br />
      <br />
      I havent found a useful article yet that fits my need. All the resources I have are too technical to begin with. Has it been suggested over this forum to include the basics to advance level tutorials in the software bundle as a separate .chm tutorial?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Sometimes it sleeps</strong><br />
      This is a good book indeed. So, there arent any books published in printed format yet. Is that what you are saying?<br />
      <br />
      Authors can make a big crowd in this because it is new. Especially if we are dealing with Java. Well java doesnt seem to have a simple way to implement what the NSIS can do.<br />
      <br />
      Howevever, for me, the setback to that is in dealing with databases. That is one of my greatest questions but I dont know if this living forum can answer that as well.<br />
      <br />
      The two java examples in the official site doesnt provide enough solution. For instance, I am dealing with MySQL database and I would like to include the JVM, the MySQL binaries and package it in the installer so that wither or not java is installed in the user's machine the software will run absolutely from its libraries.<br />
      <br />
      But I think no one is stopping me from posting just that. I am only familiar with Install4j and Exe4j but all of these require us to buy them and they offer it for free but that in the time of installation we see the annoying thing which says:<br />
      <br />
      "Created using blah blah blah..."<br />
      <br />
      before the setup process begins. Which we could not just give to the clients. There is an alternative --Buy a license.<br />
      <br />
      The only issue I have with NullSoft Install System is that it doesnt allow us to override the:<br />
      <br />
      NullSoft Install System --------------<br />
      <br />
      in the pages we create. But may be just a newbie kind of reasoning. It might be overriden.<br />
      <br />
      If this is indeed a living forum. It can answer me and point me to the right direction. Or I may assume it sleep(s) sometimes.</p>
