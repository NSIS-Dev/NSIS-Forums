      <p class="post-content"><strong>Comments on 1.63 beta?</strong><br />
      Just curious everybody, anybody have any comments/problems with NSIS 1.63 beta? I was worried that the changes could cause problems (hence the 'beta') but I haven't heard anything about it. Any successes/failures? I'd like to move it to non-beta if no problems have been found... :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I haven't seen anything wrong with the new version, but I do have one request.<br />
      Could you update the contrib directory with the newest copy of Install Options. You can grab it from <a href="http://installoptions.sf.net/io.zip" target="_blank">http://installoptions.sf.net/io.zip</a><br />
      <br />
      This version adds checkboxes &amp; option buttons. It changed a bit of other source code, but nothing major.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.<br />

      <p class="post-content">1.63 seems to be solid. I carefully observed the installer for odd, unexpected behaivour but I did not find anything.<br />
      My script file weighs in at a hefty 16k. I think I am using every NSIS function available. If anything comes up you'll be the first to know.<br />
      <br />
      Keep up the good work!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Comments? Cheers for using my code :-)<br />
      <br />
      Problems? There's a small bug in CEXEBuild::do_add_file I think. When using /r to recurse into subdirectories, the code added to double-up '$' symbols does not null-terminate the output string.<br />
      <br />
      As for the changes to strings - when I was testing it I changed VAR_CODES_START to some silly value like 65 to highlight any strings that weren't being processed in the installer when they should and vice-versa. You might want to do the same for a final check.<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately I've not been able to use the later NSIS's for my installers at work as they are using a heavily customised version of 1.44. I keep meaning to have a go a re-doing the changes in the latest NSIS... (some of which are not needed anymore because new NSIS features can be made to do the same!)<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise, it <i>appears</i> to be working great :-)<br />

      <br />
      Sorry about forgetting to comment out the printfs.. they were supposed to end up as #ifdefs but I forgot.<br />
      <br />
      It seems fine, I built a few inistallers with custom icons and bitmaps etc and it seemed to work okay.</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS 1.64 is here.. cool (what happened to 1.63 final?) :)<br />
      <br />
      Ar.. that makes this feature request a bit late then :(<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>  static const char VarNames[] =<br />  ...<br />  "CMDLINE\0"       // 13<br />  ...</code>
</pre><br />
      <pre>
<code>        ...<br />        case VAR_CODES_START + 13 : // CMDLINE<br />          lstrcpy(out, GetCommandLine());<br />          break;<br />        ...</code>
</pre><br />
      Could something like that be added? My own selfish reasons for asking, of course ;) but come to think of it, maybe it could pave the way to transfering some of the uninstaller code for copying to the temp directory etc to NSIS script?!!!<br />
