<code>
ExecShell "open" "***91;exename***93;" "***91;parameters***93;" SW_SHOWMINIMIZED

</pre>Where [exename] is the name of your .exe file and [parameters] are the parameters for it. If it doesn't work with "open", try something else (I'm not sure if "open" also works with executables).<br>

      <p class="post-content">This don't work either. Unfortunately ".exe" doesn't appear in the extension association in the explorer settings. Therefore i think it can only be "executed". But then there should be a way to change the status Maximized, normal or minimized like in shortcuts</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know. I didn't find it there eighter. But in Visual Basic, there is a very similar API command called ShellExecute. That does virtually the same and works the same.<br>
      <br>
      I found some more information about this function <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shellexecute.asp" target="_blank">here</a>, and it states that you can use the "open" action for documents, files and executables.<br>
      <br>
      Please post your code here, or at least the error you get, and where. Do you get the error when compiling the script, or when you run the script, or doesn't the exe start at all, without any messages?</p>

      <p class="post-content">mmh I didn't checked the state of errors yet but i can say that the script compiles without error but it seems that the exe wasn't executed but i will use the iferrors for testing purposes but i check for his later</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's because the writers of the docs are experienced C++, NSIS, Java, VB programmer's that forget things that are very normal and common for them, like knowing that you always have to fill in a parameter even when it's not used.<br>
      <br>
      I deal with it all the time myself. I help people with Windows computer problems via the phone or e-mail and forget that very basic things like knowing how to open the context menu of a file or browsing for a folder are not known with those users.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't know how to describe it any better. When the 5th parameter is required, obviously you can't pass it as the 4th parameter.</p>
