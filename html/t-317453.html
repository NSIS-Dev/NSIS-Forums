If it is, then allow the Install button to proceed. If it is not, then pop up a message box with instructions. After Okaying the button, stay on the page and let the user try again.<br><br>The way I do this is to have the function call itself. Recursion seems like the wrong approach but it works - almost. I have been unable to figure out a way to make the Back and Cancel buttons behave as expected.<br><br>Keeping track of the state of the DirRequest is not sufficient because these buttons should be able to do their actions regardless of its state. But I don't see how to work around this.<br><br>This seems like a fairly normal operation and I would have expected to find some info on it but I've come up empty.

I thought it may have had to to with the fact that my page didn't have a Next button but an Install button. I was verifying this condition as I was writing this and suddenly it began to work. I'm not usually in favor of Then a Miracle Occurs code but unless the problem re-manifests I'll just mush on.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
