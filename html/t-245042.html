      <p class="post-content"><strong>.jar File is being opened with Winrar and not with Java</strong><br />
      I made an installer for a Java Application , which works<br />
      wonderful, detects the JRE, if there is no JRE, installs<br />
      it and so on...<br />
      <br />
      I have only one Problem, in some computers the Executable<br />
      .jar file is being opened with WinRar and not with Java<br />
      which is what is supossed to happen, of course !<br />
      <br />
      ist there a way that I can programm the NSIS installer, to<br />
      tell the local computer to open the .jar files with Java and<br />
      not with Winrar.<br />
      <br />
      I would appreciate any help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's a bit complicated as it involves several registry entries under HKCR.<br />
      <br />
      Here's a MSDN article that might help get you started:<br />
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch11c.asp" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/de...html/ch11c.asp</a><br />
      <br />
      Unfortunatley, I don't have any idea of whether or not there is a plugin, external command, etc. that would make this easier to change. (The only other thought I had was perhaps re-installing the Java runtime.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just out of curiousity, why not call the appropriate java command directly?<br />
      <br />
      You of course change the registry key...I think its HK_CLASS_ROOT/jarfile/open/command...etc...</p>

      I am trying to make my installer execute a .jar file/application with a parameter. I am trying to use<br />
      MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN and MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_PARAMETERS but I cannot get it to work.<br />
      Can you explain how you are running your executable .jar file?
