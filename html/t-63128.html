      How does one become a mod for this forum? Since there are none, shouldn't the people who know a fair bit about NSIS be put in as mods?<br />
      <br />
      Suggestions:<br />
      <br />
      DuaneJeffers<br />
      liquidmotion<br />
      <br />
      and anyone else who has some good knowledge of the program, and is willing to help out.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">nsis is a tool mainly for software developers<br />
      <br />
      they usually don't flood the board with newbie questions<br />
      they usually don't post in the wrong forum<br />
      they usually don't crosspost<br />
      they usually don't post crap/offending or illegal stuff<br />
      <br />
      why need a moderator?<br />
      tech questions can be answered with member status, can't they?<br />
      <br />
      but if you want this job - you got my vote :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">There was a thread about this before, and the official response was (I Think) that they were told there would be no moderator for this forum, and that Justin was watching over it. Also the facts above I bet.</p>

      <p class="post-content">But there have been people who are just new people and they don't know to search the forums. Until recently, forum-goers to the NSIS Discussion forum, new to senior members, have not been doing that, and that is because of the new updates. Once Justin starts to settle down and likes the version he creates, as-is, we will be seeing new and, yes, Senior members asking for help without searching the forum. Then we will need some moderators who know what they are talking about. I believe also the moderators should be posters who take part of at least 90% of the discussions, who help new posters when after searching the for their problem, and I believe it should be some one who adds to the NSIS project.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I agree with Lion King to be honest, look through the last threads.. most questions have been answered quickly and efficiently..<br />
      <br />
      and literally reiterating what Lion King said,<br />
      <br />
      they usually don't flood the board with newbie questions // okay, perhaps there are a few obvious questions, but none that deserve deleting<br />
      <br />
      they usually don't post in the wrong forum // I can remember just one which was sorted by a moderator of another forum<br />
      <br />
      they usually don't crosspost // cant remember any<br />
      <br />
      they usually don't post crap/offending or illegal stuff // haven't seen one instance</p>

      <p class="post-content">if there was a forum mod, could they make an NSIS forum template. As stated before, most visitors to this board are developers who dont want to wait ages for pages to load... especially when some only have 56k.. a text only, ultra fast template would be really nice and anyone that could do that would have my vote any day.</p>

      </blockquote>Yeah - nice idea pjw :D :D :D<br />
      <br />
      I've got to agree with LK too tho - we seem to get along fairly well without mods here - if we did have a mod all the mods of other forums would get stupidly jealous 'cos the job here would be so simple :p<br />
      <br />
      Still, cheers for the plug Daune - if there ever is a mod here you've got my vote too<br />
      <br />
      ...someone else who's on a shoddy 56k
