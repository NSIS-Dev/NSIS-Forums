Know i have a ridiculously large log which contains the DetailPrint entries but not the other DetailsWindow data, along with other unnecessary data.<br><br>Logging has to work for the Silent installation too.<br><br>Since no clear answer to this Problem exists, i hope to find one here.<br>Is it even Possible to dumb the DetailsWindow-Content to a File in a Way which works in a Silent installation too?<br>If yes: Do i do it with LogSet?<br><br>I've checked all the Plugins but they don't seem to solve my Problem.

No-can-do on that front.<br>You'd have to write a macro that performs both DetailPrint and a file-write to a log file. But that won't automatically capture the automated entries for e.g. File operations.. so you'd have to write a macro for those, too.<br>The alternative is to take the log file you've got now, read it line-by-line, and write out the lines you're interested in to your actual log file.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Zinthose</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th September 2010 00:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I smell a feature request..<br><br><b>New Command</b></p><blockquote>DetailToLog [<i>&lt;FileName&gt;</i>|Enable|Disable]</blockquote></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Animaether</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th September 2010 06:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">well, technically, the logging build already logs just about everything.. the 'problem' is that it outputs too much... while a DetailPrint+Log outputs too little.
