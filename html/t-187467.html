      <p class="post-content"><strong>String Function Header: "WordFunc.nsh"</strong><br />
      Nullsoft Install System is the best. But when I had been writing<br />
      one script I could not do some string operations. I started to try<br />
      various functions, but unfortunately they were narrowly - directed and<br />
      some of them hanged during testing it I think inadmissible.<br />
      <br />
      For this reason I wanted to write universal function on which other<br />
      functions can be based and wrote "WordFind".<br />
      <br />
      Recently I have finished creation of a header file which includes<br />
      the following functions (with many examples):<br />
      <br />
      1. WordFind (un.WordFind)<br />
      2. WordReplace (un.WordReplace)<br />
      3. WordAdd (un.WordAdd)<br />
      4. WordFind2X (un.WordFind2X)<br />
      5. StrFilter (un.StrFilter)<br />
      6. CopyToClipboard (un.CopyToClipboard)<br />
      7. CopyFromClipboard (un.CopyFromClipboard)<br />
      <br />
      I shall be grateful if you will estimate the done job. :)</p>

      <br />
      1) They have uninstall.<br />
      2) Doesn't matter what you use the most. Sometimes neither I use it. It's only a selection of functions. I was thinking on your header file to make some changes to StrFunc.<br />

      <p class="post-content">It's giving a foreign language 404 html error...<br />
      <br />
      Now this is the time...:<br />
      <br />
      You did a great job on doing all that. I really should stop my vacation on the StrFunc development now.<br />
      <br />
      I see that you have some ideas on the header file itself:<br />
      <br />
      - !define _UN1 when using uninstaller functions.<br />
      <br />
      One thing to improve here is that you could make a smaller header file using this below as an example:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>!macro un.CommandCall Parameters<br />  !define _UN1<br />  !insertmacro CommandCall ${Parameters}<br />  !undef _UN1<br />!macroend<br /><br />!macro CommandCall Parameters<br /><br />  # A normal command call<br /><br />!macroend</code>
</pre>- It doesn't have a command to separate commands for install and uninstall functions. Makes more lines of code (inside header file), but makes easier for the user.<br />
      <br />
      And I did test your functions, they are in great shape, but we need to make sure that it doesn't have any bugs. Using that program of yours it will be much easier.<br />
      <br />
      Now a list of planned things for StrFunc.nsh 1.07:<br />
      <br />
      - I'll examinate your first 5 functions in your header file for bugs, if they have, I'll call you here. If not, they'll be included.<br />
      - Did you see my first suggestion here? StrFunc has a problem like it. I should fix it.<br />
      - An example program like yours (kichik told me before to do a different example program than just a simple test).<br />
      <br />
      Because I already promissed the InstallOptionsEx new version soon, I'll start working on StrFunc only after that plugin launchment.<br />
      <br />
      Ok, that's all for now. See you soon.

      <p class="post-content">I'd like to have some of your functions in the better shape as possible for the people (as I said before). You don't imagine how tested the functions that are included with StrFunc.nsh within NSIS are. As NSIS is in a stable version, we test everything we can...<br />
      <br />
      I know, you've done a good job, but we need it to be a "perfect" job. As I had to do before. So that's why I'm asking more favors from you now:<br />
      <br />
      - General:<br />
      <br />
      - Don't try to compress every option and, for example, words to add under one parameter, try to expand it into several parameters so makes the input more organized (for the user).<br />
      <br />
      - Try to make an error handler like NSIS do, it never outputs like a parameter, but it uses the command "SetErrors". Only in much complicated matters is used another return value for errors (like InstallOptions).<br />
      <br />
      - Try to make it accept the String without separators. That means "String" should have the minimum of 1 word (not 2 as now it is).<br />
      <br />
      - Make output parameters as the first, then the input ones.<br />
      <br />
      - As all the functions are ${WordFind} dependant, you could make them with more options, like the ${WordFind} itself.<br />
      <br />
      - Learn to use default values for the parameters, like in ${WordAdd} the "Delimiter" parameter could have a value when it is empty.<br />
      <br />
      Don't be mad at me just by that, when I started nor even English I did understand well, now after about two years using NSIS (I'm member here since Dec, 2002, but I used NSIS since Aug, 2002) I have two projects that I'm working right now, and other several functions, but most of them I kept abandoned.<br />
      <br />
      (Sometimes you can see me as a perfectionist, that's because I'm an user and a developer at the same time.)</p>

      </blockquote>It is simple to do. The offer: SetErrors for errorlevel 1-4.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        - Try to make it accept the String without separators.
      </blockquote>What sense? What tasks can be solved thus?<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        That means "String" should have the minimum of 1 word (not 2 as now it is).
      </blockquote>There is minimum = 1 word + delimiter ([Word][delimiter], but not [word])<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        - Make output parameters as the first, then the input ones.
      </blockquote>If it is critical that I can change it. Though it is more habitual for me by analogy to use of functions:<br />
      <pre>

</pre><br />

      <blockquote>
        - As all the functions are ${WordFind} dependant, you could make them with more options, like the ${WordFind} itself.
      </blockquote>The concrete example is necessary for me (What string is given? What it is necessary to make?).<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        - Learn to use default values for the parameters, like in ${WordAdd} the "Delimiter" parameter could have a value when it is empty.
      </blockquote>All values required I don't want to change it (There are no those parameters which it is possible to name by default).<br />
      <br />
      I in any case do not become angry. I am glad, that there are people which express the opinion. :)

      <br />
      I have thought that you have suggested to add besides errorlevel parameter also command SetErrors.<br />
      <br />
      I want to tell, that errorlevel serves for the greater concrete definition of mistakes (you are itself understand it) which it is possible and it is necessary to use (Examle.nsi).

      I asked all that because some of them are better to be changed in the function itself if you can do it. If you can't, no problems.

      You even can enter no words, but a delimiter should be found necessarily (accepted: string from one delimiters).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      If you are going to test functions, you can enter any parameters and strings - functions will not hang and will show result (at least so reflected).<br />
      <br />
      Pay attention on (WordFind):<br />
      --------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      Strings:<br />
      "[word+1][delimiter][word+2][delimiter][word+3]..."<br />
      "[delimiter][word+1][delimiter][word+2][delimiter]..."<br />
      "[delimiter][delimiter][word+1][delimiter][delimiter][delimiter]..."<br />
      "...[word-3][delimiter][word-2][delimiter][word-1]"<br />
      "...[delimiter][word-2][delimiter][word-1][delimiter]"<br />
      "...[delimiter][delimiter][word-1][delimiter][delimiter][delimiter]"<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Deguix. I obstinate, but attentive.<br />
      <br />
      1) Has reduced quantity of output variables in Word functions (with 2 up to 1).<br />
      "WordAdd" now accept one word.<br />
      New "WordReplace" option {}.<br />
      New function "WordInsert".<br />
      New example-program "RenameIt".<br />
      Add an example for WordFind "To accept one word in string if delimiter not found".<br />
      <br />
      2) Has processed StrFilter:<br />
      -Inclusion of the certain symbols (without the filter)<br />
      -Removal of the certain symbols<br />
      -Multilanguage support (at present English and Russian)<br />
      <br />
      If somebody can help with other languages I shall be grateful<br />
      English: A-Z (ACSII code: 65-90)<br />
      a-z (ACSII code: 97-122)<br />
      Russian: FirstSymbolInUpperCase-LastSymbolInUpperCase (ACSII code: 192-223)<br />
      FirstSymbolInLowerCase-LastSymbolInLowerCase (ACSII code: 224-255)<br />
