Please wait".<br><br>BUT - - when it reaches a certain component, the progressbar text stops refreshing, and is showing the text that pertained to the <i>former</i> section.<br><br>I know this is what happens, 'cause at this point my installer does what I want it to(works).<br><br>I have ten components; ten separate sections you can choose to install(and also uninstall when it comes to that).<br><br>Each component is a little different, because they manipulate a different number of files.<br><br>So I noticed that when one component which is only supposed to manipulate <b>two</b> files was executed(this is when I choose to install all the components), it "looked like" it was manipulating <b>a lot</b> of files. But what was <b>really</b> happening was that the progress bar text hadn't jumped to this section, but was "hanging" on the former section(which manipulates a lot of files), which was what confused me.<br><br>-If I choose to ONLY install the component that seemed to manipulate several files(and is only supposed to manipulate two files), it really <b>does</b> only manipulate the two files.
