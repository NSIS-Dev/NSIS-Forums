      <p class="post-content"><strong>Install Shield convert- Using NSIS for the first time</strong><br />
      &nbsp; After taking example1.nsi and attempting to make it work for my target application, NSIS prompted me with the Install Dir path that I had entered into the InstallDir variable.<br />
      <br />
      I don't want the user to be able to change the path, only the drive to which the application is installed.<br />
      <br />
      1. Where can I find an example to prevent NSIS from prompting<br />
      the user to change the installation path?<br />
      2. Where can I find an example that lets the use change the target destination drive ONLY?<br />
      <br />
      I didn't see anything that would do what I need in the examples directory<br />
      <br />
      thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">As far as I know this hasn't been asked before, however it shouldn't be too hard.<br />
      If you're using Modern UI you just don't need the !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY in your code.<br />
      <br />
      As for selecting a drive to install to, your best bet is to make an InstallOptions dialog. See InstallOptions examples in Examples\InstallOptions, Examples\Modern UI\InstallOptions.nsi and the readme under Docs\InstallOptions.<br />
      <br />
      There should be some functions or a plugin on the Wiki to get a list of hard drives on the computer.<br />

      &gt;&gt;If you're using Modern UI you just don't need the &gt;&gt;!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY in your code.<br />
      I'm not doing this at all. I'm merely used the example1.nsi in the examples directory, and set<br />
      <br />
      INSTALLDIR = "C:\MyPath"<br />
      <br />
      and I was prompted with a dialogue box to browse to e new path or type it in by hand.

      <p class="post-content">Use the NSIS page command.<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
Page license
<br />Page components
<br />Page Instfiles 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>Normally there would be a "Page directory" in between components and instfiles, but you can leave it out to omit the directory page.<br />
      <br />
      Will try to write an InstallOptions page in the next few minutes here...<br />

      </blockquote>I see. I 've removed the Page Directory, not it doesn't prompt the user.<br />
      <br />
      This program is really a bear to figure out.<br />
      I'm starting to think that Install Shield is a better way to go.
