      <p class="post-content"><strong>splash dll problem on Vista</strong><br />
      I ran into a problem when running the installer on a brand new copy of Vista. The installer would crash shortly after the splash screen, and the event logs would complain about splash.dll unloading. Here is a copy of the event log:<br />
      <br />
      Faulting application RUSetup.exe, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x46fe4a1d, faulting module Splash.dll_unloaded, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x46fe4a03, exception code 0xc0000005, fault offset 0x100012b3, process id 0x880, application start time 0x01c82c7d47530e3e.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone have any info? The installer was built with NSIS 2.3.<br />
      <br />
      More info: This happened several times in a row, and then all of a sudden stopped happening, and I still can't repeat it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There's no such version as NSIS 2.3. You probably got that version from the about dialog of MakeNSISw. On that dialog, look at the grayed text at the bottom. That's where NSIS version number is.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've also tested the default splash example on Vista and it works just file. I also see nothing in the code that'd have it execute anything in the message loop after the window has been destroyed as suggested by the message. Unless it's a very very very old splash version, I'd say there's some rouge program has subclassed the splash window for some weird reason. Is there a DLL list anywhere in that crash report?</p>
