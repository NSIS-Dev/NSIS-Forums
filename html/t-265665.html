      <p class="post-content"><strong>replace CANCEL button text on just one page?</strong><br />
      A how-to query from a brand-new NSIS user:<br />
      <br />
      I would like to replace the text of a CANCEL button in the Modern UI for <b>just one page</b>.<br />
      <br />
      I see how to accomplish this globally for all CANCEL buttons in the UI. I also see how to change the text of the ACCEPT/OK/AGREE button on a specific page.<br />
      <br />
      What I have not been able to figure out is if there is an easy way to change the text of the CANCEL button on just the LICENSE page. (Our legal folks are very picky, and would like the UI to present the options as "Agree" or "Do Not Agree" instead of "Agree" or "Cancel.")<br />
      <br />
      Can anyone suggest a solution?<br />
      <br />
      Many thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the answer! But being a newbie, I could use a little context for the code.<br />
      <br />
      Where do I put this? fsp.nsi?<br />
      And what in that code restricts the replacement to just the Cancel button on the License page?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Compile the example, execute it and you'll know where and what, all you need is this,<br />
      !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE dir_pre<br />
      just before your license page, and the function named dir_pre somewhere in your script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm working with andy on this project. Were both unfamiliar with the build process as we've been using the installer version built into Zinc. Within the zinc/nsis directory we've been editing the system.nsh with limited results to get btn changed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't know what is Zinc. If you're referring to NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\System.nsh, you shouldn't touch it unless you know exactly what you're doing, you may destroy the Modern ui by doing this.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, what's the problem and you can't implement just 5 lines of (provided above) code in your script to achieve the text on cancel button specifically for license page?<br />
      <br />
      If you don't know how to copy/paste text within a text editor, this isn't the right place to ask how to do it.<br />
      If you know, just copy/paste the line,<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE dir_pre</code>
</pre><br />
      just before the license page macro, and add the function,<br />
      <pre>
<code>Function dir_pre<br />GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 2<br />SendMessage $0 ${WM_SETTEXT} "0" "STR:Do Not Agree"<br />FunctionEnd</code>

      on the bottom of your script.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>got a new question related!</strong><br />
      Hi everybody!<br />
      <br />
      What I was wondering is how it would be if instead of trying to change cancel button text from licence page we try to change cancel button text on language dialog selection.<br />
      <br />
      I cannot figure out because in this case we have not any page defined...<br />
      <br />
      I found couple of tags like MUI_LANGDLL_WINDOWTITLE and MUI_LANGDLL_INFO, but still do not knok to to change buttons text on this dialog....<br />
      <br />
      I'd be really gratefull if someone answer me, but thanks anyway to everybody!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I realized that it did change cancel to next while it was installing, but then changed back to cancel when it was done.<br />
      <br />
      Another thing: I want to change the "close" button, not the cancel button, so is there a paramater I need to change to make this work?</p>
