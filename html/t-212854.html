      <p class="post-content"><strong>Release Notes</strong><br />
      We spend a lot of time trying to get our Release Notes in tip top shape. Except apparently no one reads them. While we have our share of clueless newbs, to their defense they aren't very prominent.<br />
      <br />
      Currently I do this:<br />
      <br />
      Function .onInstSuccess<br />
      MessageBox MB_YESNO $(Success) IDNO NoReadme<br />
      Execshell open "$INSTDIR\Release Notes.txt"<br />
      NoReadme:<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunatly for some reason Execshell opens up the default application (notepad.exe) sometimes in the background and it isn't very intuitive.<br />
      <br />
      Honestly what I would love is to simply have a "License" page displayed upon success. Something still inside the installer. I think this would result in maximum viewability.<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Llynix, I feel your pain. My customers seem to ignore all the documentation we put out like its the plague or something. Any how, if you want to display some information within the installer, what you need is a custom page. You can either make this page come up 100% of the time, or use a message box like you are now, and give the option to skip it (and set a variable). When you build the custom page, in the "display" function check that variable, and skip the actual display command for the function if needed, and the page will not be displayed, make sense? Hope this helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could work with page and pageEx commands and display your notes in a license screen.<br />
      <br />
      The page command gives you control in which order the pages are shown</p>

      </blockquote>Looks like I gotta learn how to do custom pages :)<br />
      <br />
      I'm just going to make it come up all the time. I figure it takes a user just as long to click no as it would take them to just completely ignore it.<br />
      <br />
      At least with it popping up 100% of the time I can chastize users a bit for not reading them. Currently I've been too kind to them :)

      <p class="post-content">LoboLunar's nsWeb plugin is also very good. It can display a web page either published on the web or as a file on the hard drive. Pretty easy to use without a lot of custom page functions.<br />
