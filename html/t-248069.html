      <p class="post-content"><strong>Package files extracted from a files' list ?</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      <br />
      I have just discovered NSIS yesterday, and since then, I have been working a lot with it, reading all the documentation, FAQ, etc... I have to confess that I love what you guys made of this tool ! It's great !<br />
      Only one thing that bothers me... and I have now been looking everywhere for a possible answer for that, without any success... :-(<br />
      Here is the thing: I have a text file in which all the files I would like to package are listed.<br />
      I would like to know if it is possible to read this text file and include these files to the package.<br />
      I have been trying to do that for hours... I would really appreciate any help.<br />
      Thanks !</p>

      <p class="post-content">Build a NSIS installer which you execute at compile time. It will read from your text file (using FileOpen, FileRead and FileClose) and generate NSIS code which you later !include in your main script...<br />
