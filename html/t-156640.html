      <p class="post-content"><strong>nsexec and custom messages in the progress bar</strong><br />
      hi!<br />
      I have already got a lot of help from u guys...<br />
      I have a question.<br />
      In the end of a section I use nsexec to run minimized 4 .bat files that create and format sqlserver databases.It takes a lot of time the operation to be completed so I want to ask u if there is a way to display a custom message above the progress bar to inform the user that e.g "database 1 is being created","database is being formatted" etc etc<br />
      <br />
      Thanx in advance (sorry for my poor English)</p>

      <p class="post-content">also there is a modified version of nsExec (need to search back a few pages) that shows a spinning text star whilst nsExec is working<br />
      <font size="1">i.e.</font><br />
      <b>/</b> -&gt; <b>-</b> -&gt; <b>\</b> -&gt; <b>|</b> -&gt; <b>/</b> etc.<br />
      <br />
      it should work fine for your needs (i really should look at finishing the code for a few other parts ;) )<br />

      I found some nsexec mods but none of them had any such feature listed...<br />
      It would be very helpful if u could give a link (if it is not a problem)</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanx a lot DrO.<br />
      how do I define the character that is going to spin?<br />
      Can u post an actual nsexec syntax example? (and maybe include it in the test.nsi when u put it in the official contrib folder)<br />
      <br />
      Also does anyone know how I can change the cursor indicator from arrow to hourglass?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thanx in advance!!!!</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>that's not possible with that version (was tempted to make it customisable).<br />
      <br />
      just use it as you would normally use nsExec. best thing is to alter the dll name so you still have the original version e.g. nsexecmod.dll.<br />
      <br />
      then you would use it as nsexecmod:ExecToLog ... (check the nsExec example on how to use it - haven't looked at it for a while so i'm not too sure on the syntax)<br />
      <br />
      with the cursor thing i think you need to use the system plugin and you will want to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Resources/Cursors/CursorReference/CursorFunctions/SetCursor.asp" target="_blank">SetCursor</a> function in it (someone else may be able to help you better on that).<br />
      <br />
      [ may make sense to add that into the modified nsexec to do the cursor thing automatically as an option ;) ]<br />
      <br />
      (will have to work on this tonight while i remember)<br />

      <p class="post-content">here's a later version of the modified dll (have had to disable a few parts quickly on the way out the door so it's usable).<br />
      <br />
      there's a few additions to the readme file on usage of the modifications. will have a finalised version in a week or so (i hope ;) to handle a few extra bits i've been working on with it)<br />

      <p class="post-content">it all depends on the program, some can and the version i was developing was able to handle most cases of those programs.<br />
      <br />
      unfortunately most don't seem to and the code can't access the screen data until the program finishes (in the thread further up i think i posted the relevant comment from microsoft about the issue).<br />
      <br />
      because of that the spinning star was the best way i could think of to indicate processing is happening (the dll attached fixed the display issues that were in the first version i put out). i need to fix the code for those programs that do handle real output (so it doesn't lose a few characters or repeat parts slightly) but is hard with only a few examples to work with :(<br />

      </blockquote>I tried with one exe that does live output but your nsExec only prints it at the end. Do you want it?
