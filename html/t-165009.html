      <p class="post-content"><strong>File /oname usage</strong><br />
      I am having trouble using File to write one file to $SYSDIR. When I hard code a file name, no problem; the errors occur when I use variables.<br />
      <br />
      A usage that I found in the NSIS directory is:<br />
      /Contrib/AdvSplash/Example.nsi:10: File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\splash.bmp "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Makensisw\logo.bmp".<br />
      <br />
      The manual states "...When using the /oname= switch, only one file can be specified, and the file name can contain variables..."<br />
      <br />
      So my usage is:<br />
      1. File /oname=$0 "SysDLLs\$0"<br />
      OR<br />
      2. StrCpy ${MISSING_DLL} $0<br />
      File /oname=$0 "SysDLLs\${MISSING_DLL}"<br />
      <br />
      and on both compiler error is:<br />
      "File: "SysDLLs\$R5" -&gt; no files found.<br />
      Usage: File [/nonfatal] [/a] ([/r] filespec [...]|/oname=outfile one_file_only)"<br />
      ($R5 for MISSING_DLL; usage #2 or substitute $0 in message for usage #1)<br />

      <p class="post-content">your fault is, that the /oname switch must be set on compile-time. but $0 isnt set on compile-time. therefore the error occurs. the filename can only contain constant variables, set by !define or by nsis on compile-time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That seems kind of silly...let me understand you:<br />
      I can use a variable, but only one that is set at compile time and not<br />
      !define VAR_NAME $R5<br />
      so I can set it later...hmmm:(<br />
      <br />
      I am verifying 18 different systemdll files in $SYSDIR. Any suggestions on alternatives to:<br />
      IfFileExists $SYSDIR\$0 present absent<br />
      present:<br />
      DetailPrint "$0 present in $SYSDIR$\n"<br />
      goto exit<br />
      absent: #start comparing with all 18 file names:<br />
      StrCmp $0 "file_1.dll" 0 file1<br />
      ....<br />
      StrCmp $0 "file_18.dll" 0 file18<br />
      goto exit<br />
      file1:<br />
      File /oname="file_1.dll" "file_1.dll"<br />
      goto exit<br />
      ....<br />
      file18:<br />
      File /oname="file_18.dll" "file_18.dll"<br />
      goto exit<br />

      <p class="post-content">That is incorrect Comm@nder21. Of cource /oname is a run-time setting, otherwise it would be quite useless.<br />
      <br />
      The fault you are making is that the file location is a compile-time setting.<br />
      <br />
      The compiler has to know the location of the file on the compiler system, otherwise it can't include anything.<br />
      <br />
      Example of correct usage:<br />
      <br />
      File /oname=$0 "file.dll"</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, that is the usage. It is unfortunate that I can't use variables for both arguments. Any further suggestions would be welcome also!<br />

      <p class="post-content">You don't seem to get the difference between compile-time and run-time.<br />
      <br />
      How could it allow you to use run-time variables when it has to include a file on the compiler system? You can use compile-time defined symbols.<br />
      <br />
      If you have 18 different compile-time files you will have to include 18 file commands. However you can crete a macro that does all the checks.</p>

      i've confounded the two parameters '/oname=targetfilename' and 'originalfilename'<br />

      </blockquote>this post mentions using !defines instead of variables, which I finally get (I think..) and I just wanted to clarify the last part.<br />
      So, if I'm using !defines like so:<br />
      <br />
      !define FILE1 "D:\stuff\myfile.txt"<br />
      !define FILE2 "D:\stuff\nxtOne.txt"<br />
      <br />
      The only way I've been able to use these defines with the File command is like this:<br />
      <br />
      File ${FILE1}<br />
      File ${FILE2}<br />
      <br />
      So what would the macro Joost is talking about do? Check to see if a file needs to be backed up or whatever else you wanted to do before installing the file?<br />
      <br />
      Or is there some way you could call the File command using defines inside a macro? So you could have a loop to go through all 18 of your defines?<br />
      <br />
      I tried to do some nested stuff where I was creating the string "${FILE1}" but that's failing because I'm still storing that string in a variable, which the File command can't see...<br />
      <br />
      So, if you've got 18 Files to install - you need to use 18 File commands, even if you are using defines? End of Story right?<br />
      <br />
      thanks for the clarification, I've been going around and around on this trying to get some sort of trickery that I thought I'd seen somewhere on these boards, but I've just ended up confusing myself..<br />

      <p class="post-content">You cannot loop through defines unfortunately as they are around on compile-time not run-time.<br />
      So yes you have to insert X File commands.<br />
