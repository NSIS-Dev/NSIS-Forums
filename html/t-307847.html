I forgot to mention that I am already using a RUN function as I am using the UAC plugin and therefor the application should be started by the user who originated the setup.<br><br>Currently my function looks as follows:<br></p><pre>
<code>
ExecAppFile    
<br>   !insertmacro UAC_AsUser_ExecShell 'open' '$INSTDIR\opencpn.exe' '' '$INSTDIR' ''
<br>   FindWindow $0 '#32770' '' 0
<br>    System</code>::Call "user32::SetForegroundWindow(i r0) i."
<br>&gt;FunctionEnd 
<br>&gt;

</pre>So in "normal" cases you only need the UAC_AsUser_ExecShell macro and the application gets automatically the focus.<br>
      <br>
      But in some cases my application starts with a message box before the application window exists. The window title is localized (by the application) so I don't know it. And as there is also no window parent I cannot use it, too.<br>
      <br>
      The only thing I know for sure in this case is the name of the process.<br>
      Is there any way to bring the message box to the front?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks,<br>

      I could have come to this conclusion myself as actually adding a sleep command seems to be the "universal" solution for all my problems .... ;)<br></p>

      <blockquote>
        <small>Originally posted by Anders</small><br>
        Try using just "Sleep 3000" no findwindow etc
      </blockquote>I tried it with 2000 and it worked.<br>
      <br>
      But all these ugly sleep commands are a bit unpleasent, especially as e.g. the time needed by the application to launch may differ from user/ system to user/ system.<br>
      <br>
      Do you think that a loop checking for the process being started could be an alternative?<br>
      <br>
