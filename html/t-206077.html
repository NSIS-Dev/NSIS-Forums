      <p class="post-content"><strong>connecting variables ???</strong><br />
      since i am working on my latest project i need an array for seperate languages which differs from NSIS-system for language<br />
      <br />
      i do it like this:<br />
      <br />
      !define g_active "bla"<br />
      !define e_active "blubb"<br />
      !define f_active "nonsense"<br />
      <br />
      g e f are standing for the 3 languages and handle in this var $LANGSHORT<br />
      <br />
      so the message goes like this:<br />
      messagebox mb_ok "${$LANGSHORT_active}"<br />
      <br />
      but i only get "${g_active}" :cry:<br />
      <br />
      is it possible or not ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure I understand exactly what you are asking. To my knowlege, NSIS does not support arrays.<br />
      <br />
      But, the way I'm reading your question, it sounds like you simply want to concatenate all g, e, and f variables. If that the case, then use this:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />strCpy $LANGSHORT_active "${g_active}${e_active}${f_active}"<br /></code>
</pre>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS dont support arrays - that i found out a longer time ago<br />
      some1 has written another solution for that...<br />
      search for "array" here...<br />
      <br />
      but that was not my purpose...<br />
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; strCpy $LANGSHORT_active "${g_active}${e_active}${f_active}"<br />
      <br />
      $LANGSHORT is a standalone variable<br />
      it is possible to combine it with fixed values eg.<br />
      $LANGSHORTmenu01.ini (for IO)<br />
      but i didnt match it for 2 variables in a box<br />
      <br />
      <font color="green">${</font><font color="red">$LANGSHORT_active</font><font color="green">}</font><br />
      <br />
      red is the inner name and green the outer name<br />
      <font color="green">${</font><font color="red">g_active</font><font color="green">}</font><br />
      <br />
      This is the result -&gt; ${g_active}<br />
      but it is not handled as a variable any longer, just plain text.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, hopefully I've got this all sorted out. Let's see how I did...<br />
      <br />
      You have a variable called $LANGSHORT, which can be either 'g', 'e', or 'f'. You want to take this value and append '_active' to come up with a variable name and then from that return the value of that variable?<br />
      <br />
      Based on your example above, it sounds like $LANGSHORT has a value of 'g'. Therefore, you want to return the value of the variable $g_active, (which is 'bla'). But instead of getting 'bla', you are geting the text '${g_active}'. (Right so far?)<br />
      <br />
      While I haven't been able to work out a formula quite on your line of thinking, I did manage to find an alternative that should acomplish the task. It uses a 5th variable and a string of StrCmp functions to return the proper variable by using a function. It's goes something like this:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Function GetValue<br />    StrCmp $LANGSHORT "g" returnG findE<br />  returnG:<br />    StrCpy $0 ${g_active}<br />    Return<br />  findE:<br />    StrCmp $LANGSHORT "e" returnE findF<br />  returnE:<br />    StrCpy $0 ${e_active}<br />    Return<br />  findF:<br />    StrCmp $LANGSHORT "f" returnF findNothing<br />  returnF:<br />    StrCpy $0 ${f_active}<br />        Return<br />  findNothing:<br />    strCopy $0 ""<br />FunctionEnd     <br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      (This is just a quick example--in practice, you might need to clean this code up a bit.)<br />
      <br />
      If this doesn't give you want you want, perhaps there's a brighter bulb out there that might be able to offer some other advice.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!

      <p class="post-content">&gt;&gt; It's goes something like this:<br />
      <br />
      That is what i already had and i want away from.<br />
      It blows up my code and theses fragments are thrown all over my code.<br />
      <br />
      I have to think about an (ini-) array :/</p>
