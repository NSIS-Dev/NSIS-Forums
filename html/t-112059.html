In my computer for example the clock is showing now 14:29, now the NSISdt show normal (we are between feb/8 and mar/7), but after mar/7 will show +1 hour of original time (the time here will not to be in the summer time!), after oct/20 will show the original time, and after oct/28 will show -1 hour (when the time here will be in the summer time).

      In fact I've found a small bug in this code example - $CMDLINE may return for installer.exe name in double quotes, or with some parameters, so I've changed scripts a bit (Could Kichik or some one else update CVS version please ;).
