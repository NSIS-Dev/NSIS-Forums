      I have also tested your test script and faced the same problem.<br>
      <br>
      Then I have used the Process Monitor to watch the process but did not find any obstacles (but this may be due to my limited knowledge in that area). I have attached the Process Monitor recording, may be one of you can recognise any problem.<br>
      <br>
      My test script looks like the following:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>
outfile test.exe 
<br>requestexecutionlevel user 
<br>page instfiles 
<br>Section 
<br>initpluginsdir 
<br>SetOutPath $pluginsdir 
<br>File "RunAsDll\RunAs.dll" 
<br>&gt;StrCpy $1 "xxx" 
<br>&gt;StrCpy $2 "yyy" 
<br>&gt;StrCpy $3 "C:\WINDOWS\NOTEPAD.EXE" 
<br>&gt;MessageBox MB_OK "1:$1 2:$2 3:$3 4:$4"
<br>&gt;System::Call 'RunAs::RunAsW(w r1,w r2,w r3,*w .r4) i .r0 ? u' 
<br>&gt;MessageBox MB_OK "RunAs Message: $4 ($0)" 
<br>&gt;SetOutPath $temp 
<br>SectionEnd 
<br>&gt;
</code>
</pre>The Process Monitor recording was done between the first and the second message box.

      <p class="post-content">I have tested it with another machine and recognised that it worked before some patches have been applied, but after the wsus installed some XP and Office updates the error occured. Unfortunatly I was not able to identify the patch, which causes the problem.<br>
      <br>
      Anyhow, part of the RunAs plugin does anybody know another method with NSIS to call a process with another user? Is there maybe a system call that I could use?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the quick answer.<br>
      @ Afrow UK, I have used your plug-in under XP before, but unfortunatly it did not run under Windows 7.<br>
      <br>
      @ Anders, I have looked at them as well, but as I am not a very good programmer I had some problems to find the right syntax.<br>
      <br>
      However, I think I have found another solution. I am using a freeware tool called runasspc and starting it with an ExecWait command.<br>
      <br>
      This is my new test script:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code>
outfile test_runasspc.exe 
<br>requestexecutionlevel user 
<br>ShowInstDetails show
<br>Page instfiles
<br><br>Section 
<br>SetShellVarContext all
<br>SetOutPath $APPDATANSIS_Temp
<br>File "runasspc\runasspc.exe"
<br>&gt;File "7_admin.exe" ;the file performs the elevation for Windows 7 and some system changes
<br><br>StrCpy$1 "AdminUser"
<br>&gt;StrCpy $2 "Password"
<br>&gt;StrCpy $3 "Domain" 
<br>&gt;StrCpy $4 '"$APPDATA\NSIS_Temp\7_admin.exe"'
<br>&gt;SetDetailsPrint none ; in order to hide the password
<br>ExecWait'"$APPDATA\NSIS_Temp\runasspc.exe" /user:$1 /password:$2 /domain:$3 /program:$4 /quiet' $0
<br>SetDetailsPrint both
<br><br>DetailPrint "Exec Message: $0" 
<br>&gt;messagebox mb_ok "Exec Message: $0" 
<br><br>&gt;SetOutPath $APPDATA
<br>RMDir/r /REBOOTOK "$APPDATA\NSIS_Temp"
<br><br><br>&gt;SectionEnd 
<br>&gt;
