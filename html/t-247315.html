      <p class="post-content"><strong>Trojan in NSIS 2.14 !?</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      <br />
      We've been doing some tests lately with NSIS and this morning I downloaded the 2.14 release from<br />
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22049&amp;package_id=15374" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showf...ckage_id=15374</a><br />
      for my computer.<br />
      What was my surprise, after installing it, when I found out that the file 'zilb' in 'stubs' was infected by Win32/SillyDL.1gl!Trojan .<br />
      I also found out that ALL setup made with this version are also infected...<br />
      I'm using Etrust Anti-virus and for so long it's quite accurate.<br />
      Could someone tell me I'm wrong and that a bunch of app out there are not infected :(<br />
      <br />
      I also checked the lastest release (2.17) a it seems fine...for now.<br />
      Also note that we've been using release 2.14 since 2 monthes now and the trojan has been detected only since this week-end. I guess it might be a mistake but.... :)<br />
      <br />
      thank you</p>

      </blockquote>Thanks, that's what I though too. I'll send them the 'infected' file and ask them to double check it...

      <p class="post-content">Ok, got an answer from Etrust, the file is no longer seen as a trojan and everything is working fine now :)<br />
