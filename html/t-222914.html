Debugger for installers to see what exactly its doing on my computer. The previous topic asked if you could extract a source installer file but I'm not asking this. What I'm asking is if theres a sort of exe shell that can launch a program and create a fake mounted drive of an operating system and hook all commands and log them.<br><br>I know its possible but, I have never seen any such software so far. Not all installers make log files saying exactly what action they took to install the program or set of programs. I see tons of program packs, freeware packed together that installs just like the seperate installers but in one foul swoop.<br><br>This question kinda works with nsis and any installer program. I ask this for multiple reasons, I like want to make a custom codec pack and multiple other things. I do not want to load each installer from a main installer and go through tons of differant screens to install a pack of codecs or other things. So I wanted to install them all at once by installing it finding out the installer installed them all and copy that as well as add in more to it.<br><br>I may be off base asking, it may not be possible or insanely easy but... I have not been able to find a way and was hoping someone here could help me out.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th July 2005 11:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx" target="_blank">Virtual PC</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank">VMWare</a> or <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Bochs</a> along with <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Filemon.html" target="_blank">FileMon</a>.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th July 2005 11:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Many thanks to that hastey reply, I'll check them out.

BSOD'ed me and screwed up my network settings... I had to fix my PC for a bit...It BsoD'ed on installation of the VPC 2004 trial. I have a Mirror Raid which probably is the reason why it crashed... Stupid windows and its stupid stupidness :(.<br><br>Got any other suggestions for debugging installers besides full OS emulators...? No person has every thought of the concept of making a debugger that just reads that exe's commands that its set to watch through windows and file calls?<br><br>Bochs looks useable besides the fact that its a hell of a lot of work to do something so simple...or at least a simple need.<br><br>Bochs works but fails to boot even though i followed the config description... Is there possibly any tutorial sites, or an alternate help site besides his main one? I didn't find anything helpful. It seems that program was made for masters, or maybe I'm just slow, lol.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
