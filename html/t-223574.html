      <p class="post-content">OK, I got it working now, thanks for all your help.<br>
      The solution, however, is kind of strange.<br>
      I defined the InstallDir like this (straigh after all the !include pages)<br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br> ; MUI end ------<br> <br> Name "${PRODUCT_NAME}"<br> InstallDir "$TEMP"<br> OutFile "Setup.exe"<br> ShowInstDetails show<br> ShowUnInstDetails show<br> SetCompress off<br> CRCCheck force<br> </code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Now, in .onInit I wrote the check for prior versions and did the uninstall if neccessary. I checked with a MB_OK that the path for $INSTDIR was correctly set (which it was). That didn't help as I stated above.<br>
      Now thanks to the last script-example of Stu I got the missing point: StrCpy $INSTDIR "$TEMP" straight before doing the check and the uninstalling does the trick.<br>
      <br>
      So this is what my solution looks like:<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>ClearErrors<br>  StrCpy $INSTDIR "$TEMP"<br>  ReadRegStr $R1 ${PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY} "${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY}" "UninstallString"<br>  IfErrors +8 0<br>    MessageBox MB_YESNO|MB_ICONQUESTION|MB_DefButton1 "$(OldInstFound)" IDYES 0 IDNO +7<br>    ClearErrors<br>    CopyFiles /SILENT "$R1" "$TEMP\uninst123.exe"<br>    ExecWait '"$TEMP\uninst123.exe" _?=$INSTDIR'<br>    IfErrors 0 +2<br>      MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION "$(OldInstNotRemoved)"<br>    Delete "$TEMP\uninst123.exe"<br>  ClearErrors<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      If I messagebox $INSTDIR before the StrCpy and after, it's the exact same string (due to InstallDir "$TEMP" above) but without the StrCpy I cannot leave out the quotes on the _?XXX section.<br>
      Let me make that clear: quotes on the _?XXX section of ExecWait will result in ExecWait failing. (Insert a MB_OK in Stu's script after the ExecWait and play with the quotes - MB will pop in the backgroung with quotes but won't without)<br>
      Notice that in neither ways of defining $INSTDIR the variable itself contains quotes, but without doing a StrCpy the _?XXX part without quotes is failing to execute the uninstaller and with quotes it's failing to wait for the uninstaller.<br>
      Hope this can help someone in the future and thanks again for all your advice<br>
      <br>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, the solution is not to use quotes around the _=? parameter. See <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter3.html#3.2" target="_blank">chapter 3</a> of the documentation for more information.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So Afro in your example, you suggest having another script purely for the uninstaller, you can't bundle it in with the original install script? I don't see how that example won't just uninstall anything immediately after it's installed otherwise.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The compiled installer which should be used as the uninstaller would indeed uninstall everything, if you execute it. But the idea is not the execute it and instead extract it from the installer as the uninstaller.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Right, I guess I was hoping I could create both installer and uninstaller in the same script as I had been doing before, but it's not the end of the world if I have to use two files.</p>
