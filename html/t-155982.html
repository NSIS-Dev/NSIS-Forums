I think it is possible, and it would save you a lot of trouble. You could use Saxon to parse the xml and xslt-files to html files. And it would create the possibility to change the looks of the output html-file without diving into computer code. Another thing is that people with Xml and Xslt-enabled browsers may assign a different stylesheet to the Xml-files, which results in the look-and-feel they desire, which may very well differ from the default look-and-feel.<br><br>Just a suggestion, but I think that you should take a look here: <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=916000#post916000" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....000#post916000</a>.

      </blockquote>The File instruction seemed the most complex one to me. So if the File instruction can be described, then with no doubt the others can too.<br>

      </blockquote>I agree. I think that an XSL schema would be complicated, but highly modifiable on the other hand. A source code parser would be fast, but wouldn't allow much modification.<br>
      <br>
      I tought that a combined work of the two might be nice. What about a program which parses the 'xml-file for applications' to an 'xml-file which looks like a webpage', which then can be combined with an xsl-file. This would allow users to modify the look of the documentation, and save us a lot of touble getting the stylesheet right. We could use a modified version of the format and stylesheet I made before: <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=916000#post916000" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....000#post916000</a>.

      <p class="post-content">1) Ok for me the xml description of functions can be that one; maybe we should also wait for kichik to see if he has suggestions.<br>
      <br>
      2) What I mean is: do we need a more rich desciption language? So it can include other possibilities?<br>
      <br>
      3) I dont like very much the idea that the browser should parse itself the xsl file to format the page, bacause I think we will be limited to IExplorer6 and we should check for the browser version.<br>
      <br>
      Instead it would be cool that the new software will parse the xsl and generate html from the xml formatted as xsl said.<br>
      <br>
      Rememeber also that additional text must be added to those xml documents to produce the final docs.<br>
      <br>
      Lets take an example:<br>
      halibut2xml file: basic.but.xml<br>
      xml NSIS function reference: functions.xml<br>
      xsl formatting stylesheet: functions.xsl<br>
      output file: Chapter1.html<br>
      <br>
      So the process should be:<br>
      an xml parser parse the basic.but.xml for preprocessor directives; it finds a tag that tells the parser to include file "functions.xml" and format it as "functions.xsl".<br>
      The inclusion converts the file in a complete xml file.<br>
      This xml file is then rendered to html to produce output.<br>
      <br>
      Dont know if it is simple to parse xsl and generate html, or if some libraries do the job for me.</p>

      </blockquote>Do you mean that your program, or any other program, would generate functions.xml from basic.but.xml? Or are the two (functions.xml and basic.but.xml) combined to form the document. I go for the first.<br>

Doing like this you could have 2 people working on docs at the same moment, a technician and a documenter. I think this is the cleaner solution, but maybe it is not the simplest; anyway, also the first is also a good one (we don't have much time)... maybe let's ask also to NSIS guys!

      <p class="post-content">virtlink: do you have time to make an xslt schema to transalate the xml that you posted previously and compile tha xml file of all instructions?<br>
      <br>
      I'll tell you the steps which I want to use make the new docs:<br>
      1) [Human step - but I will get them from halibut files] Make docs pages in pseudo-xml (pseudo because it must not have a top level tag).<br>
      <br>
      2) Divide these files into Chapters and Appendixes, creating Chapter1.xml, Chapter2.xml etc.<br>
      <br>
      2) [Human step] Make standalone-xml-data files (functions, instructions etc.)<br>
      <br>
      3) Apply stylesheet to transform standalone-xml-data files to xml-data (for example: apply instructions.xsl to instructions.xml).<br>
      <br>
      4) Include the transformed xml-data in the previously generated xml docs (Chapter1.xml, Chapter2.xml etc.).<br>
      <br>
      5) Process xml docs and replace reference and links.<br>
      <br>
      6) Apply formatting stylesheet to the whole project to produce html pages.<br>
      <br>
      7) Add header and footer to pages with chapter index.<br>
      <br>
      We should have 1 stylesheet for each data category (instructions, attributes, commands)? Or 1 for all?<br>
      <br>
      Then we need another formatting xslt to translate to html, but this is simpler.<br>
      <br>
      Tell me what do you think!<br>

      This zip file must be unzipped in a dir (if it is the root of a drive is better, because you will need to change a couple of paths to make it works in a directory different from "E:".<br>
      <br>
      There is a "_README" directory that contains:<br>
      - Architecture design (NSISDocsArchitecture.tif)<br>
      - Important infos (readme.txt)<br>
      <br>
      The architecture is made up of 5 layers:<br>
      - Pseudo-xml layer<br>
      - Data layer<br>
      - Business layer<br>
      - Presentation layer<br>
      - HTML layer<br>
      <br>
      1) Pseudo-xml is the markup language which I defined taking some rules from Halibut:<br>
      C = chapter<br>
      A = appendix<br>
      T# = paragraph<br>
      R = internal reference<br>
      L = link<br>
      W = web link<br>
      etc.<br>
      This files are clled psudo-xml because the xml top level element is missing.<br>
      <br>
      2) Data layer is like a database and contains the standalone xml files which must contain instructions, attributes, commands etc.<br>
      Data layer is converted in pseudo-xml with appropriate xsl transforms.<br>
      <br>
      3) Business layer is the conversion of pseudo-xml to real xml with the inclusion of files generated from data layer.<br>
      <br>
      4) Presentation layer is the conversion of business layer replacing all reference and internal links.<br>
      <br>
      5) HTML layer is the conversion of presentation layer into html with another xsl Transform.<br>
      <br>
      Tell me if it works on your machine!<br>
      On my machine this is a working example (from halibut files to html documentation). Conversion from halibut to pseudo-xml is separated from the process because it must be done only once. Don't do it, because I added some lines to pseudo-xml converted from Halibut to test the include feature.<br>

      I think that I understand it now, but please correct me if I'm wrong:<br>
      There are source files. These are combined with the 'pseudo-xml' files. The 'pseudo-xml' files contain how the data in the source files is layouted (one instruction per page, or all instructions per chapter, etc..). Then you have files which can be converted to Html easely.<br>
      <br>
      I left out some steps (link supstitution, data rendering, etc..) but I am aware of that, and I think that my description above gives a more general point of view (yours is very detailed).<br>

      I left them only to have the current situation.<br>
      When the data files will be ready, we will strip out repetitions.<br>
      <br>
      What you call "source files" I prefer to call "data files", but it's ok; they are "combined" (xsl transformed and included) in 'pseudo-xml' files; the 'pseudo-xml' files contain how the data in the 'source files' is layouted (processed and xsl transformed).<br>
      BUT the first xsl-transform to source-files (i.e. instructions.xsl) contains the description of layout of "source files" in our pseudo-xml markup language. Infact to every &lt;i&gt; tag is added a &lt;T2&gt; tag to define a new paragraph.<br>

        <p class="post-content">Your program works, but I have a suggestion.<br>
        Maybe it would be a little bit easier to build a program which converts the files in the dl-folder to their rendered equalivents.<br>
        Creating a stylesheet for them seems a little bit unnescessary IMHO, since (if we do it correctly), the syntax should never change.<br>
        And in case the syntax changes (added functionality), then much more has to change anyway. A little bit digging in the C++ program would be a lot easier than learning Xslt from the beginning. And I think that there are more people on these forums who know C++ than Xslt-stylesheets.<br>
        <br>
        I will try to write a small Console program for it in C#, but then should you translate it to C++.</p>

        More: think about this software as a generic documentation software, not only for NSIS; so the "dl" files can change quickly and doing a new C++ code for each would be a useless mess.<br>
        <br>
        I was thinking that the "instructions.xsl" file should transform the "instructions.xml" file in a near-html fashion, with tables and layout, but still our markup language tag for defining paragraphs and links.<br>
