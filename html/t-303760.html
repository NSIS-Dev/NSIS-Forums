      <p class="post-content"><strong>Managing Sections depending on License Feature</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      i have a Setup that is supposed to react to features that are extracted out of a license file.<br />
      <br />
      I will get back a string like "Feature1,Feature2,Feature4,Feature5" for all valid features.<br />
      <br />
      I disable all(!) Sections and SectionGroups using SectionSetFlags.<br />
      <br />
      Now i check for the single Features using ${Wordfind} and if a feature exists i (re)enable certain sections.<br />
      <br />
      There are quite a few sections (roughly 30) and i am looking for an easier way to manage that stuff since i have to enable some sections twice (e.g. once for Feature1 and once for Feature3)<br />
      <br />
      Has anyone done something like that before and would like to share knowledge?<br />
      <br />
      I have attached the part of the script that i am talking about.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">could you loop over the sections, grab their text, and compare the text to a featureset variable that is based on the features enabled?<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Function Test<br />        StrCpy $0 0<br />        _loop:<br />                ClearErrors<br />                SectionGetText $0 $1<br />                ${If} ${Errors}<br />                    goto _done<br />                ${Else}<br />                    MessageBox MB_OK "[$1]"<br />                ${EndIf}<br />                IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br />                goto _loop<br />        _done:<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      ( you might be able to abuse the section flags as well as there's quite a few bits unused )<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Alternatively, perhaps you could use InstTypes with SectionIn? ( though I think that adds an installation type drop-down above the components which you would subsequently have to hide from the user )<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Mind you, limiting installation features based on a 'license' like this is pretty poor protection unless used in conjunction with other functionality to prevent the user from e.g. simply extracting the files (if only file extraction would be needed).

      </blockquote>I know, but it was (luckily) not my decision to do it that way, sadly i have to implement it :(

      <p class="post-content">well, I hope the method above might be of use, then - it would provided fully automated handling of section enabled/disabled states, without having to adjust a separate section of code each time you add/remove a section to the list/etc.</p>
