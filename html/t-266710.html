Therefore it would be timeconsuming and error-proned to do a rebuild of this state or trying to reconstruct the build out of existing files for recompiling the script.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th February 2007 17:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I see, however developers who want to distribute software safely, should never disable the CRCCheck (which is enabled by default) so even if 7zip or another tool would offer abilities to add/replace files within the package, would be useless as they would alter the CRC causing the installer to pop up a warning about potential danger.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">BFuture_BM</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th February 2007 17:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">indeed, i have crccheck disabled, because the installer can only be transfered within a client-server-application, which is caring about the issue of devective transmissions.<br>additionally, the file i want to be replaced has the same size as the original one (to the last bit), because i only changed a string-content.<br>so, do you think there is any possibility to replace this file?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th February 2007 18:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">As far as I know the only tool that is able to open a NSIS package is 7zip but you already know that they haven't implement yet the add/replace feature.<br>I'm afraid you're going to recompile the whole script or create a patch which updates the current installation with the new file.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">BFuture_BM</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th February 2007 18:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">that was the answer i was afraid of, but thank you very much for your aid!</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
