      also works, but thats a one time thing only when started from your installer

      <p class="post-content">not knowing further details of what's going on, etc but it's possible to disable a process from DEP as shown <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2008/01/29/new-nx-apis-added-to-windows-vista-sp1-windows-xp-sp3-and-windows-server-2008.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> though that is mainly aimed at coders but it may be off some help (or more likely not but mentioning it whilst i remember).<br>

      <p class="post-content">ah, yes, I had forgotten about those API's (it also exists on XP SP2, but with a different name, and it's undocumented, IIRC google chrome uses it, check its source)<br>
      <br>
      But these API's have the same problem as setting the registry option, if DEP is always on, they have no effect.<br>
      <br>
      So why can you not switch to a different packer? UPX?</p>

      <p class="post-content">wasn't sure if it'd work if it's been forced on. but yeah would make more sense to switch to a different packer (if that really is something that is needed to be done).<br>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for your suggestions, the registry method doesn't work, even when using full path. There must be an additional step.<br>
      <br>
      Switching to a different packer will be the last resort as my whole registration system, which includes an online component, is built on asprotect.<br>
      <br>
      Someone gave me a link - blogs.msdn.com/gauravb/archive/2008/09/23/disable-dep-on-applications.aspx<br>
      <br>
      But i'm not sure how i can use it since asprotect runs before my application does.</p>
