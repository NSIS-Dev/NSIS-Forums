      I recommend you not to rely on external applications to copy files.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, that's what i would also do, if i would only konw how to copy whole directory including every unknown subdirectory in parent directory to somewhere else. It would be great, if i could exclude some defined filetypes, or even better include only defined filetypes.<br />
      CopyFiles /SILENT '$From\*.doc' '$To' ;&lt;- not good enough<br />
      if you know something for it, let me know, if not, maybe someone can still give me some information about xcopy.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, he ment, that you should call xcopy in the console with the parameter '/?'.<br />
      usually the programm now gives out it's syntax.<br />
      but why don't you just launch the programm without any parameters?<br />
      or search in the internet for "xcopy syntax" or something like that?</p>
