      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS equivalent of merge modules</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hi,<br />
      <br />
      We have some sub projects (which typically install a small tool) which we use in other larger projects. I would like to create NSIS installers for the smaller projects that I can then reuse in the larger projects (which typically take a selection of the small tools and package them together). Is there a good way to do this?<br />
      <br />
      Steve.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can include .NSI scripts in a main .NSI project. So, what I've done is separate certain sections of my installer into sub parts and then have thin main projects that include many of the sub-components or sections. It prevents duplication of work, it doesn't have the overhead of a whole MSM, it's easy to track in versioning software. I prefer this method to MSMs myself.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks,<br />
      <br />
      This sounds like exactly what I want to do - are there any examples of this way of doing things around?</p>

      <p class="post-content">There won't be examples of this because as most examples are typically quite small we do not need to split them up.<br />
      <br />
      It's quite simple. When you use !include File.ext you are effectively copying the contents of that file into the current script where you have put the include statement.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The basic idea is something like this:<br />
      <br />
      This is sharedtool.nsi<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
Section "-Hidden Shared Tool"
<br /> File "blah"
<br /> ; Set registry settings or whatever
<br />SectionEnd 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>Installer that uses shared tool:<br />
      <pre>
<code>
Section "Component 1"
<br /> ; Files
<br />SectionEnd
<br /><br />&gt;; This line would be in every installer that you would
<br />&gt;; want to have use the shared code
<br />&gt;!include "sharedtool.nsi"
<br /><br />&gt;Section "-Post"
<br /> ; Settings
<br />SectionEnd 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>Keep in mind this is just the most *basic* example. For all of this to work it needs to have some forethought. Do you want to share sections? lists of files? It's all up to you. I keep track of all the installs myself so my system is a little... sloppier, for lack of a better word, but it's quick and easy. If you have multiple developers for the same setup, you may need to think it out a bit more.<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps.
