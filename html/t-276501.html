Instead of requiring every website visitor that wants to download our work knowing about BT and stuff we thought it would be cool to be able to deliver the files in a self contained BT download app. As in you just click the download link and it will load an installer with will download the torrent for you into a defined dir.<br><br>&lt;some help&gt;<br><br>Like i said I am a artist not a programmer and totally confused about this installer... I can make a simple installer that will install a file into a defined dir and even worked out some ways of making the installer look a bit more pretty... BUT I can not figure out how to get the torrent side of it to work at all.<br><br>&lt;What I have done&gt;<br><br>I have a tracker set up and working<br>I have the torrent seeded<br><br>&lt;The Question I came here for&gt;<br><br>Dose anyone have any working code they wish to share that will allow me to make the torrent installer?<br><br>or<br><br>Dose anyone knowa complete nub guide to making a torrent installer...<br><br><br>&lt;final thought&gt;<br><br>Any help would be very appreciated (this is a hobby project between mates and non profit btw) Though we are willing to paypal donate if somone will help us get this downlaoder off the ground.<br><br><br>Thanks for reading.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Oddsodz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st August 2008 18:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">This maybe an old thread.<br><br>But I can not find anywhere on the site a nice guide to making this work.<br><br>I have been looking at the Battle-Torrent system.
