      I'm trying to modify one page in Modern UI. I have added an extra control to the required dialog. I just need a hint of how to modify the contents of it from the installer itself.<br />
      <br />
      Any help will be greatly appreaciated.<br />

      <p class="post-content">First use command:<br />
      ReserveFile "my_page.ini"<br />
      then in .onInit function use :<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_EXTRACT "my_page.ini"<br />
      then from your script modify "my_page.ini" before call your custom page, like this:<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE "my_page.ini" "Field #" "Value Name" "Value"</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think that you misunderstood me. I am trying to add an image control below the progress bar in the install page. I used a resource hacker to add the control however I cannot seem to be able to specify the image file for the control. I have tried the 'SetBrandingImage' command but it does not seem to function as I expected.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I tried this code but there seems to be some error as it does not work :cry:</p>
      <pre>
<code>  StrCpy $1 "C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Graphics\Header\modern-header.bmp"<br />  FindWindow $0 "#32770" "" $HWNDPARENT<br />  GetDlgItem $0 $0 "1028"<br />  System::Call "user32::LoadImage(i 0, t r1, i ${IMAGE_BITMAP}, i 0, i 0, i ${LR_LOADFROMFILE}) i .r5"<br />  dumpstate::debug<br />  SendMessage $0 ${STM_SETIMAGE} ${IMAGE_BITMAP} $5</code>
</pre>It's probably somethink extremely simple that I just overlooked but I just can't seem to be able to figgure this out.<br />
      <br />
      NOTE: dumpstate shows that $0 contains the required info but $5 is always '0'<br />

      <p class="post-content">Add the ?e switch to System::Call to find out what the error is. For example:<br />
      <br />
      System::Call "user32::SetWindowText(i 0, i 0) ?e"<br />
      Pop $0<br />
      DetailPrint $0<br />
      <br />
      should print out 1400 which is the error code ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE. You can get the description for the error code from WinError.h or using <a href="http://www.gregorybraun.com/MSWinErr.html" target="_blank">this program</a>. There is also the program that comes with VC.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks although my installer generates error 2. Which was because I did not check to see if the file was there. After fixing that problem the error code is 0, but the image still won't display.<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, so it seems that its not getting the right HWND. How do I fix that? I used a couple of resource editors and they both say that the bitmap control is there. I have changed the control ID and tried the script again. Then the script used a different ID that the one in the exe file $0 was '0' but when I changed the script to match the ID it showed up a normal value.<br />
      <br />
      Are you sure that one can change the background color of an image control?<br />

      <br />
      kickik what is the best way to modify the UI exe file. I noticed that some of the Modern UI mods are only for that particular page and they do not seem to modify the main UI file. How do I do that?<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, just spotted a little problem with this approach. It appears that the image get wiped out if the installer loses focus, e.g. get minimised and restored or another windows dragged over the top of it.<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas on how to fix this?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">You can modify just certain dialogs and then load them in using ChangeUI IDD_LICENSE | IDD_DIR | IDD_SELCOM | etc. instead of loading all of them.<br />
      <br />
      The image is probably wiped because you delete the image object before its usage has finished. Delete it after you replace it, not after you set it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, the MUI has some defines to change the UI, but none change only the instfiles page. I think it would be best if you tell the user to put ChangeUI IDD_INSTFILES at the end of the script, or at least after the page macros.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry to revisit an old thread, but I was wondering if there was a similar command that allowed to specify a JPEG rather than a BMP file.<br />
      <br />
      Bitmaps are rather large and it seems a waste of space when it could be smaller as a JPEG. Unless i'm way off track JPEGs have better compression than BMPs compressed with normal compression algorithms like BZIP2 or LZMA.<br />
