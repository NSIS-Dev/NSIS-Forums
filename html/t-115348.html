I know that ms installer will check if there is .net installed and if not it will run dotnetfx.exe, but I would like any way to detect if .net is installed and if not it will run this app. So when I compile .nsi I would include the dotnetfx.exe. I just have no clue on how to do this and would appreciate any help.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th November 2002 17:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">This page should help you with .NET:<br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetdep/html/dotnetfxref.asp" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/de...otnetfxref.asp</a><br><br>I don't quite understand what files exactly you want for OpenGL... AFAIK every graphics card has different OpenGL drivers, and you can't just driver that will handle them all. There is a program that comes with Q3A that is supposed to install the latest OpenGL drivers for you. It's called GLSetup, but it's pretty much dead now, last news item on their website is from September 17th, 2001...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaszbo</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th November 2002 21:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">your right most will have opengl already, but in case they don't.
