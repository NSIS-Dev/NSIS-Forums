      <p class="post-content"><strong>Control Panel uninstall wont CallAs Guest user</strong><br />
      This problem is Windows Vista-related. I have an application that writes to its own directory (usually in Program Files\whatever), so the written file ends up in VirtualStore. I cannot change this behaviour, as the application is not mine.<br />
      <br />
      When uninstalling this app in Windows Vista through Control Panel / Programs and Features, I am unable to get CallFunctionAsUser to reach the guest user. Instead, the function is called as the (admin-)user that the uninstaller was elevated to.<br />
      <br />
      I have attached an example script. The installer manually creates a file in the Guest User's VirtualStore, and the uninstaller tries to delete it.<br />
      1) I login as guest user and run install.<br />
      2) It asks for an Admin login, so I log in as my standard account, "Maarten".<br />
      3) Installation completes successfully.<br />
      4) I go to Control Panel / Programs and Features, and start uninstall.<br />
      5) It asks for an Admin login, so I log in as my standard account, "Maarten".<br />
      6) The output of the MessageBox call is: C:\Users\Maarten\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\UAC Test\test.dat<br />
      <br />
      In other words, un.UserFunction was called as Maarten, not as Guest User. However, if I start the uninstaller manually through Explorer, the function DOES get called as Guest User.<br />
      My question is now, is this a bug in the UAC plugin, a 'feature' in Windows, or am I doing something wrong?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

      <br />
      So, the UAC plugin is not the real solution here, if you are admin, you can enumerate all the users anyway, so use <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/EnumUsersReg" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/EnumUsersReg</a> , figure out the path to the virtual store and delete your folder</p>
