      <p class="post-content"><strong>zlib on x64 issue</strong><br />
      Situation: MS Windows 2003 Server Enterprise x64 Edition Service Pack 1, Dual Core AMD Opteron 280, 2.4 GHz, 2 GB, NSIS 2.22, default compression (zlib). Just created package with 64 bit binaries (about 18 MB). When launched displays message box "Error decompressing data! Corrupted installer?". If I make small changes in script (comment lines) new package may be correct (seldom) or may not (often). Particular package behaiviour repeatable.<br />
      This never happened if: 1) "SetCompressor lzma" both simple and /solid; 2) if package includes 32-bit binaries (sounds weird, but it is so, may be because package size is less, about 15 MB); 3) on x86 comps.<br />
      I could not reproduce the situation using a short NSIS script samples - packages started correct (and unfortunatelly had not time for long tests with my big script). Simple patch - I switched to lzma and happy with it (package is smaller, 10 and 13 MB, may be not good for marketing department ;) With /solid 7 MB). But if somebody knows good zlib test - I can run it there (using Remote Desktop).</p>

      <p class="post-content">It sounds to me like a size problem as well. Did you try adding more data to the lzma installer to see if it happens there as well? It'd also be a good idea, even without this problem, to add tests for the compression and decompression modules in Source\Tests. I thought I added those already, but apparently I didn't. Are you up for adding those for testing your problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've started writing one. Currently, it tests only zlib and bzip2. I've attached both a test to the source tree and a compiled tester. It tests compression of up to 32mb files. Works fine for me on x86. Let me know how it goes on x64.<br />
      <br />
      Another good test would be opening the installer with 7-zip and seeing what it has to say about it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What about opening the installer with 7-zip? Try compiling another version of test.exe with an even larger compression buffer. Maybe that'd help...</p>

      <p class="post-content">With new program release I cannot reproduce situation :( If I'll have time later I'll take previous version from archive and build distribution, but I cannot promise this..</p>
