      Hey all,<br />
      <br />
      I'm hoping some of you have maybe run into this before. I'm trying to package up an application I've written, and it has a dependency on another package which is being distributed solely in the MSM format. I think other installers (like the VB and Visual Studio ones) just natively know what to do with an MSM file. Well... I didn't see anything in the documentation regarding MSM files. Or maybe I'm just being dim, and the file just needs to be 'executed' somehow or aomething. Any thoughts?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">What an Earth is an MSM file? A search on Google didn't tell me anything helpful. You don't perchance mean MSI do you? (wotsit.org didn't know what it is either)<br />
      <br />
      [edit]okay they are MSI merge modules, now I know what they are I'll have a look see if I can help...[/edit]<br />
      <br />
      [edit]Well I found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/msi/merg_2rhv.asp" target="_blank">this</a> but it's not particularly useful... good luck, I've got too much to do to chase this any further I'm afraid[/edit]</p>

      <p class="post-content">From what I understand after reading some docs at MSDN an MSM file is like an include file for MS installer projects.<br />
      NSIS doesn't work with MSI, as you have might already noticed :)<br />
      I would suggest you build a simple, quite, MSI file that just includes your MSM file and launch it (just use ExecWait) from within your NSIS installer.</p>

      </blockquote>The whole reason I'm using NSIS in the first place is because I don't have access to the VB or Visual dev studio to get access to their installer programs. And because I'd rather not support M$ given choice, which NSIS happily gives me.:cool:<br />
      <br />
      Anyways .... I'm going to try to contact the .... hmm ... I just had a thought. I *do* have access to an MSI file for that program. Excellent idea. Well... thanks all!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, you can install an MSM by using msiexec like this<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>ExecWait 'msiexec /i blah.msm /qn'</code>
</pre><br />
      That'll silently installit. Of course this'll only work on systems that have msiexec installed ;)
