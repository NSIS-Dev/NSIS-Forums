      <p class="post-content"><strong>CAB/LZX compression support?</strong><br />
      why NSIS not support CAB/LZX compression?<br />
      exellent compression ratio, better than *zip, rar, etc., free library from Microsoft ...<br />
      for example Ghost Installer use it.</p>

      3) NSIS doesn't want to be a Ghost Installer clone. Just because they have it, doesn't mean that NSIS needs to have it. The bzip2 compression would help create smaller installers.<br />

      sure, NSIS doesn't want to be GIns clone, NSIS already InnoSetup(or many other installers) clone, because both use zlib compression :D<br />
      you have exellent logic :D - because all other installers use GUI, NSIS dont want to have it. NSIS must have work under b&amp;w txtmode command prompt :p ...<br />
      <br />
      and sorry for my ugly english ...

      <p class="post-content">Using the same compression algorithm doesn't mean it's a clone (though you would say if you look at all the Winzip-like programs out there). NSIS has much lower footprint (smaller) and supports more complex instructions AFAIK. :)</p>
