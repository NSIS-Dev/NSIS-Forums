Are you trying to replace IR41_32.AX too?<br><br>Try adding /NOUNLOAD to the RegDLL command that registers IR41_32.AX. It looks like it loads itself again and waits for someone to unload it using CoFreeUnusedLibraries and not FreeLibrary as NSIS frees it.<br><br>I think calling CoFreeUnusedLibraries after unregitering and before registering the new DLLs should help.

<code>System::Call "ole32::CoFreeUnusedLibraries()"</code>
