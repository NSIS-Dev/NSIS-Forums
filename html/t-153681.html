      <p class="post-content"><strong>UpgradeDLL macro : fails to get version info for VB6 files</strong><br />
      Hi:<br />
      I'm new to NSIS. Have installed MakeNSIS v2.0b3 &amp; have included the code from Appendix C in the Modern UI example to distribute a VB6 program. Have installed the latest UpgradeDLL macro &amp; modified the App. C example to use the temp directory accordingly. The compiler fails with the msg "GetDLLVersionLocal: error reading version info from ..." on whichever DLL file I put first in the list (file exists for program to reach GetDLLVersionLocal). The files I'm checking are newly loaded from MS VB6SP5 &amp; I'm compiling on a W2K system. Can't find any info on GetDLLVersionLocal in the NSIS files or a search of the forum. Any info or comment appreciated.<br />
      Cheers,<br />
      JimG</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, probelm was that the files were in a different directory &amp; then I needed to use GetDllVersion, not GetDLLversionLocal. There is still an incompatibility with UpgradeDLL &amp; the version of NSIS because GetTempFile fails, with an error of "too many parameters". I suspect that this is also easily fixed &amp; will check the source code tomorrow. Learning, learning ...<br />

      <p class="post-content">The online GetTempFile is for the latest CVS version, in which GetTempFile does support more parameters. The new UpgradeDLL that uses this new GetTempFile prevents a possible faliure on Windows 9x where rename on reboot doesn't work across different drives.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think that all you need to do is update your copy of NSIS to the latest version.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The first parameter is the location of the VB files on your system. Make sure that is correct.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sound advice guys.<br />
      <br />
      I found I was confusing when I could use things like $SYSDIR and when not - or rather - when I was describing the location of a file on my machine and when I was describing where it should go on the target machine. Running before I could walk.<br />
      <br />
      If anyone has a fight with a VB style installation in the future I am happy to share any scripts I have up and running - albeit they might as yet be imperfect.</p>

      <p class="post-content">With respect,<br />
      <br />
      The example only covers (albeit expertly) the simplest case. Adding DAO (for instance) adds to the number and type of DLL's to be added - with the DAO dll not being placed in the system directory. There are OCX files to consider as well...<br />
      <br />
      I have seen the ActiveE.exe sample script but have yet to combine that with the rest of a VB distribution.<br />
      <br />
      Lots to try.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm talking about the VB6 runtimes, which are required for every application.<br />
      <br />
      If you need other components or libraries you will also have to install them, but that is different for every application.</p>
