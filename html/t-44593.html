      <p class="post-content">Currently NSIS allows only to delete empty directories (which is good). But in some rare cases it would be needed to delete a whole directory anyway. I propose to introduce a -f(orce) option that wipes the whole thing.<br />
      <br />
      The problem case I have is that I have a "data" subdirectory which contains an arbitrary directory whose name depends on the used portnumber. So I'd like to be able to wipe the "data" directory brutally not caring what's in there.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I see your problem (and proposed solution), but I think that the danger of this is that potentially some evil developer/terrorist/"1337 h4x0r"-wannabe will program the installer to delete the Windows directory, etc. in the instruction set. It would be like a new class of virus or something.<br />
      <br />
      Basically, I think that your proposed patch has a valid purpose, but the potential misuse of the function could have disasterous results. We also wouldn't want NSIS to get the reputation of being a "virus package" or something.<br />
      <br />
      Just my 2 cents. :D<br />

      <p class="post-content">Jupp, I know it is dangerous, but nearly every other installer offers this functionality and if I want to destroy somebodies computer, it can conveniently be done with a<br />
      !system "format c: /yes" (or similar) anyway. I used to use deltree, but that isn't provided with W2K anymore (and some other versions), so I can delete c:\Windows on Win9x easily.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, it's a good thing to have.<br />
      <a href="http://firehose.net/free/nsis/" target="_blank">http://firehose.net/free/nsis/</a><br />
      has v1.1p, which adds that functionality.<br />
      I made it a nice recursive thing with<br />
      pretty minimal overhead.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Thx</strong><br />
      Thanks Justin, you rock!<br />
      <br />
      Until now I just popped up a Messagebox on Uninstall telling the user to delete their f...reaking directories themselves :-)</p>

      <p class="post-content">spaetz, I stand corrected :D<br />
      My bad. You know, the more I think about it, the more useful that feature wuodl be (especially with the stuff I'm making right now).<br />
      Thanks for the new version, Justin!<br />
