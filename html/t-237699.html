      <p class="post-content"><strong>Win64 and WinCE</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      1) Can one create with NSIS installers that run on Windows 64 bits?<br />
      2) What about Windows CE?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Windows x64 supports 32-bit executables, so any installer you create will run on Windows x64. Windows CE is a different story. There are pages in the Wiki explaining how to install files to a PDA. For example:<br />

      <p class="post-content">For your first question, I will elaborate on what kichik said...<br />
      First off, Windows XP x64 does support using 32-bit installers, however, is unable to use NSIS to install 64-bit programs because the NSIS program itself must be 64-bit in order to identify correctly with Windows XP x64.... That can definitely be a problem, since programs that are 32-bit are redirected to "C:\Program Files (x86)" and 64-bit ones are directed to "C:\Program Files"... This means that if the installer is not 64-bit, it will identify the program wrong and install it in the wrong location. At the moment, NSIS is safe with very few people actually using x64. We need to be ready for Vista, which will start the x64 boom. If there are developers with Windows XP x64 machines, they need to start compiling 64-bit versions of NSIS and packaging them for distribution, or at least experimenting with it...<br />
      For your second question, all I can tell you is that you would have to be very careful, since the subset of Win32 can really hurt many different programs trying to port to WinCE or run toward WinCE.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't believe this to be true. There are quite a few 32bit installers, that correctly install x64 applications. The installer does itself not need to be 64bit.<br />
      <br />
      Infact, there are major DISADVANTAGES to making NSIS 64bit.<br />
      <br />
      If you make a 64bit NSIS install, it will only install on x64, wheras a 32bit NSIS can detect x64, and install the appropiate binaries, so you can have a single EXE that distributes x86 and x64 binaries.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could build a single wrapper binary that is 32-bit that detects whether you are using a 32-bit or 64-bit OS, then extract the appropriate one (32-bit installer or 64-bit installer) and run it... Then when it completes installation, the wrapper deletes the install file... I believe this is better, because you will not require code to override Windows XP x64's capability to detect 32-bit/64-bit installers and redirect to appropriate install points.... I am not quite sure, but if you compile the compiler and the NSIS system to x64, then it will produce 64-bit installers.... I am not sure though....</p>

      I have a 32-bit program but would like to test it in a 64-bit environment. However, the installer won't let me get that far. How can I install this in 64-bit. I rather not go to InstallShield route.</p>
