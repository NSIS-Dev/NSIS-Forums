but it's all i need<br><br>im wondering if there is a way to make an auto updater that will check a server for a new version or if there is a way to make it download a list of sections from a server every time the installer runs it gets a new list of options to choose from (if the list was updated)<br><br>i'd be happy enough if there were something like the uninstall generator that made an update checker where you give it a url and it checks if the file is updated by viewing a text file or something then has the user download it<br><br>i've seen SOMETHING about downloading used in the

      WinInet detach caused up to 60 sec delay on plug-in unload, but I was sure that I solved this problem in July' version.

      <p class="post-content">I was installing trial-ware that uses InstallShield, and was interested to see that its auto-update checker was based on InstallShield (see attachment).<br>
      <br>
      I was getting ready to put in a <i>feature request</i> that nsis implement this capability, but fortunately did a "Search" (BTW: perhaps the Search field could be at the top of the page to make it more likely to be used).<br>
      <br>
      I hadn't realized that nsis is capable of accomplishing this. I'm a participant on several open-source projects, and have had it on the respective to-do lists of several of them to implement AutoUpdateCheck, but wasn't clear how to go about that. Also, this valuable capability seems to be more or less invisible in the documentation.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe I'm the only one, but I had never heard of nsis' AutoUpdateCheck capabiliy (or perhaps I need to get my <i>alertness pill</i> medication upped in dosage :igor: ). To me, this is a <b>VERY</b> valuable feature ... almost up there with generating an uninstaller.<br>
      <br>
      Seems like the NsisInstaller itself could/should have this capability (nsis-#.##.exe from sourceforge) ... that would give the feature much greater visibility. Also, perhaps the <i>cleaned-up</i> bigtest.nsi example could show how to do this (or another example)?<br>
      <br>
      My impression is that the AutoUpdateCheck capability isn't particularly integrated into nsis ... fwiw, my <i>vote</i> would be to have it directly available, as a selectable default (unless it adds greatly to the size of the installer??).<br>
      <br>
      (I suppose I would even be willing to offer to help out if this capability is a <i>work-in-progress</i>)</p>

      <p class="post-content">It might not be difficult for the setup to check an update site for a newer version of the setup, download it, run it and then exit. If no newer version is found, the setup continues as normal.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can tell you how I do it in my plugins.<br>
      <br>
      I update the compile NSIS script with the newest engine version, then the installer does the following:<br>
      <br>
      It tries to find and load the VS Engine, if that fails it downloads it from the web server.<br>
      If it did load, it gets the version number from the engine DLL with a custom NSIS plugin/extension I made that reads the version # and compares it with the latest version. If the one on your system is older then the newest it updates it.</p>
