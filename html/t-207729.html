      Your last install Section needs to be like this now:<br>
      Section "My last section" LastSection<br>
      ...<br>
      SectionEnd<br>
      This'll end the range of your main install sections.<br>
      <br>
      Now, you need another section under the last one. This'll be unselected at first...<br>
      Section /o "" SpecialSection<br>
      ...<br>
      SectionEnd<br>
      In here, you want the code that DetailPrint's your configuration details.<br>
      <br>
      That should do it. There's one problem though. The details printed in your first InstFiles page will not be in your second one. The second one will start off empty.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the code snippet! I will try it soon - Removing the sections after the first Page instfiles should certainly give me what I'm after!!<br>
      <br>
      The reason this cannot be done in a Section is because the Section will execute on the first instfiles. Stu's suggestion circumvents this behavior.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks, Stu!</p>

      HELP!<br>
      I was not successful in implementing your UncheckAll function. I added a "Call Uncheckall" to my leave_function and it goes into an infinite loop (apparently there is no access to sections within my custom page leave_function). I'm not sure where to place the function call. I added the second "Page instfiles" command after my "Page custom". It still installs all the sections over again, since the Uncheckall function never worked. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was able to get the whole issue resolved by not using the UncheckAll function and instead manually unchceking sections:<br>
      !insertmacro UnselectSection ${g2o1}<br>
      !insertmacro UnselectSection ${g2o2}<br>
      !insertmacro UnselectSection ${g2o3}<br>
      <br>
      It would be nice to use Uncheckall for maintenance purposes. It seems like Uncheckall should be calling an api to get a list of all functions before looping through them. My lack of knowledge, I suppose. Stu, should you resolve the section looping issue, all would benefit from a working function.<br>
      Thanks for the usage tips on the macros. Where are these documented?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Uhm yes I see the problem...<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>!include Sections.nsh<br>Function UncheckAll<br> Push $R0<br>  StrCpy $R0 0<br>  Loop: !insertmacro UnselectSection $R0<br>  IntOp $R0 $R0 +1<br>  StrCmp $R0 ${LastSection} 0 Loop<br>  !insertmacro SelectSection "${SpecialSection}"<br> Pop $R0<br>FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Needed to increment $R0 by one every time.<br>
      Each section in an installer has an index; ie the first section is at index 0, the second is at 1 and so on.<br>
      When you use<br>
      Section "my section" SecID<br>
      SectionEnd<br>
      ${SecID} will be defined as (or rather, it will contain) the section index of that section.<br>
      <br>
      So the function loops from 0 till it reaches ${LastSection} unselecting each one.<br>
      Then I've put in<br>
      !insertmacro SelectSection "${SpecialSection}"<br>
      to re-select your special section for the 2nd install files page, because it is unselected as default (using the /o switch)<br>
