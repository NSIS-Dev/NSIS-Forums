On the systems of a few other users everything is working fine, too. But on the system of two users (so far), nothing is fine. And I have no idea why. :(<br><br>It seems so, that NSIS wont load the plugin, because every attempt to use it, ends with.. nothing. Only the given parameters are in the stack, of course.<br><br>I have tried it with the standard way (nsPython::exec "some code") and with the CallInstDLL-Function linked to the nsPython.dll within the exe-directory. I have tried the possible solutions (without success) mentioned in this thread: <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=214088&amp;highlight=nspython" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....light=nspython</a><br><br>Now, I am completely lost. The source code of this plugin has been shipped within the downloadable archive, but that wont help me, since I do not understand c.<br><br>The only thing which I recognized, is that the two users where it wont work, are using "Windows 7 Enterprise x64" and "Windows 7 Ultimate x64." All other users are using something between "Windows XP Home" and "Windows 7 Professional x64" and there it will work.<br><br>Has anyone any idea what could be so special with Win7 Enterprise and Ultimate?<br>Has anyone noticed a similar problem with nsPython or another plugin?<br>Has anyone any idea how to fix it?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2010 12:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Did you search the forum?
