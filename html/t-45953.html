There <b>is</b> an .exe file but you'll need that one to compile your .nsi scripts. To understand that, you'd better read the ducuments and examples that come with it.<br><br>About your second project, that will depend of your capability. And how you want to make it will depend on yourself. Afterall <b>your</b> the programmer. :)<br><br>But since your a newbie I personally think that you're not (yet) capable to create these programs.

Because you would have to have to take control of alot of Winamp's Interface to do this, so this plugin would disable all of Winamp's functions. Either that or just build this to work along side of it.<br><br>All that said, you will definately have to read up on it, this is a very complex idea, but it can be done.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Swat Leader</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2001 22:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well, I think I will begin with the EQ!:D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Swat Leader</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd April 2001 22:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">For who's that interest, here's my little baby.I talk about my EQ!<a href="http://www.yamaha.com/menuitems/panelviews/proaudio/GQ2015A/GQ2015A.htm" target="_blank">http://www.yamaha.com/menuitems/pane...5A/GQ2015A.htm</a>:)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
