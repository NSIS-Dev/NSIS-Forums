I am most likely doing something dumb, but I can't find any documentation on how the progress-bar gets updated, so I don't know where to begin.<br><br>Could someone enlighten me about how and when the progress bar changes its %-done?<br><br>btw: we are using ModernUI with modern2.exe, if that makes a difference.<br><br>If you want to see the .nsi, it is located at:<br><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/sc2/sc2/build/win32_install/" target="_blank">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/v...win32_install/</a><br>but it requires a dynamically generated .nsh file too.<br><br>Thanks!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st February 2003 11:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">145MB from CVS and some good moments to get it to compile just to find out that you are using Return in a section :D<br><br>When using Return in a section it won't advance the progress bar to the right position because it won't skip the instructions that come after that return statement. What you need to do is put a done label at the end of the section and jump to it.<br><br>BTW, you should put a !echo "Adding content removal..." message when including content.nsh. I was sure it got stuck somehow because it took so long on my busy computer :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PhracturedBlue</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st February 2003 16:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for the help. You didn't actually need to download the whole CVS repository, i would have been happy to provide my content.nsh file, had I known you'd need it. In any case, thanks again, I have fixed the problems, and added the echo as you suggested. I'd just like to reiterate how pleased I am with NSIS, and the people on these Forums have been extremely helpful.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
