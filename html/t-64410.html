      <p class="post-content"><strong>zip2nsi ???</strong><br />
      hi everyone... i`ve played with zip2exe, it`s very useful, but i think it needs something. zip2exe creates from *.zip file a nsis installer. but what if user want to add some license text there or something else... it`ll be very good when zip2exe generates the installer source too. it'll be very helpful for people who needs to install 2,2+e129 files. it`s shity* to write in 1st section 2000-times "File somefile.fck" in the 2nd section 30000-times "File somefile.fck" atc... you just zip some folder with files, put it in <b>zip2nsi</b>:) then you write some license text there, you make some sections ...bla-bla-bla... and a perfect installer is ready co compile. isn`t it a good idea???<br />
      <br />
      * is it a swear-word, when i add to "shit" an "y"? = shity.<br />
      if yes can i do also: fucky or bitchy, atc...?<br />
      (i`m asking just to make my english better :D)</p>

      <p class="post-content">It could be done, but the point of zip2exe is just to create a self-extracting file. It does it by extracting contents to a temp directory and creating a temporary nsi file. If you need something more complicated, I would think you would need to extract the file yourself to create the installer.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can use<br />
      File *.*<br />
      So you can select all files. That'll save you some typing :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">But if you have multiple files, then the *.* wouldn't work. It would copy all of the files in the first folder that you put the *.* on (if that made any sense). But I do see your point. I would have it if I had to make a huge installer and I didn't want to write the code. But most of the GUIs being developed in the forums could help you the most. They have syntax highlighting and other things that can help you develop the perfect installer. Now, I would love to see the Zip2Exe program create a nsi file so that I may have a template to see what is it that he did, but I would also like to see the Zip2Exe program do other additional functions. Things like adding a licence and BrandingText and other items that we could use to create an Exe from an Zip. But then that would take away from the point that the installer had in the first place. Create a great installer from a small text file.<br />

      </blockquote>Shitty is spelt with 2 't's, and is a word (meaning 'very bad' as you used it). Bitchy is also a word, but fucky isn't.<br />

      hope that helps :D<br />

      </blockquote>*.* is not recursive. However if you say:<br />
      <br />
      File /r C:\somedir\anotherdir<br />
      <br />
      Then the files can be added recursively. See the docs for the difference between that and<br />
      <br />
      File /r C:\somedir\anotherdir\*.*<br />

      <p class="post-content">ZIP2EXE simply extracts the ZIP file to a temporary folder, and writes a short script the includes this line to do all the work:<br />
