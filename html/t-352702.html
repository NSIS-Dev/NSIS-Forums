      <p class="post-content"><strong>Complex installer with restart option</strong><br />
      Hi to all,<br />
      ** I would like to ask you if I'm structuring my project properly.<br />
      <br />
      Here's what to do the project:<br />
      - You choose which components to install<br />
      - The selected components are written in INI files<br />
      - As the components are installed correctly, the ini file is updated<br />
      - If some components require a restart, after restarting the installer knows which components have yet to be installed and proceed with the rest.<br />
      <br />
      I'm complicating my life? There is an easier way to achieve the same result?<br />
      If not, you have any suggestions on how to implement it in practice (examples, functions, ...)?<br />
      <br />
      Regards<br />

      <p class="post-content">The method is fine, assuming the installer is run properly after each reboot. You could probably just put your installer, with some command line parameters, in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run , and then delete it again after reboot/rerun. This will make sure your installer is always executed at boot, until such time you're confident your installation was successful and you remove the Run entry.<br />
      <br />
      Question though: Are you sure you need to reboot inbetween components? It would make your life much easier if you'd just install all components first, and THEN reboot.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you very much for your reply.<br />
      <br />
      I honestly don't know. Is there a way to determine it?<br />
      <br />
      I need to install the AS400 client and after its service pack.<br />
      Classical installation require a reboot.<br />
      <br />
      One more thing. Do you know a way to fill in the ini file based on the components selected?<br />
