      <p class="post-content"><strong>GroupBox Text Question</strong><br />
      Hello all.<br />
      <br />
      I have an installer where I am editing the stock Finish Page's iospecial.ini before it is diplayed in order to add some colored text. That is working just fine.<br />
      <br />
      However I also added a GroupBox to the Finish Page, and it too looks good, but I noticed that the GroupBox Text (Final Update Status) is always displaying in a dark blue (see below). I tested this on another installer that begins with a custom page, and there again, the text is blue.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/orum/05.jpg" target="_blank">http://webpages.charter.net/orum/05.jpg</a><br />
      <br />
      I tried to change this using:</p>
      <pre>
<code>GetDlgItem $MUI_TEMP1 $MUI_HWND 1202   ;3rd control<br />SetCtlColors $MUI_TEMP1 "000000" "${MUI_BGCOLOR}"</code>
</pre>But no luck. The iospecial.ini code is:
      <pre>
<code>[Field 3]<br />Type=GroupBox<br />Left=120<br />Right=315<br />Top=45<br />Bottom=90<br />Text=Final Update Status</code>
</pre>Any ideas? Thanks.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">This is probably your XP theme doing its thing.<br />
      I think that XP themes will override any colors you try to set, unless you subclass the control and override the XP theme.<br />
      Did you try turning XPStyle off?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Modifying IntallOptions' test.nsi InstallOptions call did the trick and change the background color of the text.</p>
      <pre>
<code>InstallOptions::initDialog /NOUNLOAD "$PLUGINSDIR\test.ini"<br />Pop ${TEMP1}<br />ReadINIStr ${TEMP1} "$PLUGINSDIR\test.ini" "Field 1" "HWND" # 2.11 feature<br />SetCtlColors ${TEMP1} 0x00FF00 0xFF<br />InstallOptions::show</code>
</pre>Are you sure the HWND is correct? Try hiding the window using ShowWindow. This way you can't be wrong about the window handle you got.<br />
      <br />
      [edit] Turning XPStyle on indeed changed my text color. That might be the problem.

      <br />
      kichik, I believe I have the HWND correct when I added the last line of code below, the GroupBox disappeared.</p>
      <pre>
<code>GetDlgItem $MUI_TEMP1 $MUI_HWND 1202  ;Set to 3rd control<br />SetCtlColors $MUI_TEMP1 "000000" "${MUI_BGCOLOR}"<br />ShowWindow $MUI_TEMP1 Hide</code>
</pre><br />
      I have these commands in the Finish Page SHOW function, along with the other commands to change the color of other Finish Page controls. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks.<br />

      </blockquote>Nope, it seems correct. And if the control hides with ShowWindow, it most probably is. Try a transparent background, that might work.

      <p class="post-content">kichik, thanks for looking at this. I tried setting the background to Transparent, and no change. Then just to see if it was working, I did this:</p>
      <pre>
<code>GetDlgItem $MUI_TEMP1 $MUI_HWND 1202  ;Set to 3rd control<br />SetCtlColors $MUI_TEMP1 "000000" "000000"</code>

      So part of the command is working (backgrond), but not the font color part.<br />

      </blockquote>Like I said before, as long as you have XPStyle on, I don't think you can do anything about the Groupbox text color.<br />
      One hack would be to place a label on top of the Groupbox which lies on top of the Groupbox label. Then set the label text color.<br />
      If you are hellbent on using XPStyle then consider creating a plugin which subclasses the Groupbox control.<br />
      The <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/w2k/xpvisualstyle.asp?df=100&amp;forumid=3066&amp;exp=0&amp;select=674316" target="_blank">VisualStylesXP</a> wrapper might be of help there.<br />
      (I am using it in EclipseNSIS to circumvent a bug in the Microsoft implementation of WM_PRINT for certain XP themed controls).

      </blockquote>Since the above command is not working for me, I took your suggestion iceman, and put a label control directly on top of the groupbox label. It works/looks good on my PC.<br />
      <br />
      My question is this, will have any display or stability problems on my customers' PCs, with varying operating systems and/or video cards? I just want to double check that I'm not taking any risks or making a buggy installer by intentionally programming a label control on top of another control. Thanks all for your help.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Is there a particular reason why you want the groupbox color in black?<br />
      Why don't you leave it as it is?<br />
      That way the installer UI look &amp; feel will be consistent with the end-user's desktop look &amp; feel.<br />
      IMHO, that is better than forcing it to be black.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi iceman_k, I know I'm being picky, however because I am using multiple colors (see below) within the groupbox, I feel that the blue text clashes with the rest of the colored text, and also draws some attention away from the inner text as well. Again, I know I am being picky, but as along as there are no issues putting the a control on top of another, I would like the text to be black. Sorry to be a pain, and thanks again for your help.<br />

      I know, it is subtle, but I think it looks better with the black. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just to make sure that no underlying text is shown for the GroupBox, set its Text value to blank.<br />
      I don't anticipate any issues on other versions of Windows O/S or different video cards.</p>
