      <p class="post-content"><strong>Files Fail After Packaging</strong><br />
      I am developing an installer for a .NET 2.0 application and I am having a very peculiar problem. I can run the application using the same set of files I later package into the installer and the application runs fine. After I package it into the installer and install it on a machine I get mysterious problems, including an unloadable DLL error (for a DLL that is up to date and is in the install directory). Is there anything that anyone can think of that might be causing this? Am I even right to think that the problem could be coming from NSIS?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Nik</p>

      <p class="post-content">Does this happen on a different machine or on the same where you can run your app before packaging?<br />
      <br />
      Is the $INSTDIR created correctly and all files copied intact?<br />
      <br />
      Did you try to turn off the compression?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It happens on the machine I build it on and on a different machine.<br />
      <br />
      All files seem to be copied intact and correctly.<br />
      <br />
      I didn't know I could turn off compression.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I suppose the problem persists even if you attempt to run the installed application by clicking on the executable instead of clicking on the created shortcuts.<br />
      <br />
      If it isn't big trouble give it a try without compression, use SetCompress off on top of your script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd guess it's related to the registration of the files. If you're packaging .NET assemblies, you need to register them using gacutil or <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Register_a_managed_.NET_DLL_in_the_GAC" target="_blank">another method</a>.</p>
