      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to get Saved Games folder</strong><br />
      Is there a way to get a user's Saved Games folder on Vista or Win7? I could use "$PROFILE\Saved Games\", but this does not take into account the possibility of a user that has renamed or moved this folder. The Registry uses a GUID string to store the value in addition to a string named "!Do not use this registry key" inside the key where the shell folders are located. I thought of the System Plugin's Get Special Folders, but it does not seem to take into account this directory.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i understand that you'd like to make your installer as conventient to use as possible, but i also think that a user who has removed/renamed such a folder has to deal with the consequences on his own.<br />
      <br />
      however, as "saved games" might be localized, i wouldn't rely on "$PROFILE\Saved Games".</p>

      <p class="post-content">As I said, I could use "$PROFILE\Saved Games", but it is a system folder on Vista/Win7 and as such, it seems like if it is not one of the NSIS built-in variables (i.e. $STARTMENU or $DOCUMENTS) it would be a good idea to have it added to the System Plugin's Shell Folder functions, however, I am afraid that writing or modifying plugins is beyond my abilities. I am able to write some decent NSIS scripts, but I am not a programmer.<br />

      The Registry string I mentioned, named "!Do not use this registry key" has a value of</p>
      <pre>
<code>Use the SHGetFolderPath or SHGetKnownFolderPath function instead</code>
</pre>Is there anyway to call either of these functions using the System Plugin?

      </blockquote>There is. If you search the NSIS forum for 'shgetfolderpath', you'll find some examples really quick: <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?p=2462946#4" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?p=2462946#4</a><br />

      Then, a quick google for "saved games csidl" found this: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378457%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/libr...=vs.85%29.aspx</a><br />
      Next up, a google for "!define FOLDERID_SavedGames" to find the numerical value of the constant. And goody goody, Christmas came early: <a href="http://portableapps.com/node/11936" target="_blank">http://portableapps.com/node/11936</a><br />

      This took exactly 3 minutes of work. Why didn't you try it yourself?
