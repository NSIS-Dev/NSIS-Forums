      I tried to use the InstallOptions in the CVS but playing with back and next buttons I see that the window loses options. That is, the first time you see that page there are 4 fields, but after using next and back there's only one.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Results on Win98 SE</strong><br />
      Tried it under Win98 SE and I can confirm that there is a problem.<br />
      <br />
      Results:<br />
      <br />
      When the page "Install Option Test Setup: Testing Installer Options" first appears, it shows three options:<br />
      <br />
      Install support for X<br />
      Install support for Y<br />
      Install support for Z<br />
      <br />
      Only Y is ticked.<br />
      <br />
      (Below this is some other stuff)<br />
      If you click Next then Back, or:<br />
      Back (to the licence) then "I Agree",<br />
      you see only one option (X) listed.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>More Info</strong><br />
      Now this is interesting.<br />
      The above results were from running the .exe posted here by nOOn3. When I tried compiling ${NSISDIR\Contrib\InstallOptions\test.nsi myself (NSIS 2.0b,CVS 2002-11-09) the resulting .exe seems to work OK. At least it doesn't exhibit the behaviour described above. It's either a bug that has crept in subsequent to the build I'm using, or it's something on your system.<br />
      <br />
      I'm attaching the .exe and the sources (from \InstallOptions dir only)so you can compare yours with mine. See if the sources are the same, then do a file compare of your .exe with mine. (Have you made any changes to Test.nsi?)</p>

      well, I have CVS 2002-11-09 and it has the same bug.<br />
      <br />
      I attach both versions.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Is that it?</strong><br />
      Ahaaa! yes, I forgot to say that I later fixed the line-breaks on some of the text-files manually. Or, more to the point, I didn't think it was relevant. Has that fixed your problem nOOn3? (I read somewhere here today that the line-break bug has just been fixed.)<br />
      <br />
      Edit:<br />
      Yup, that was definitely it! Just recompiled Test.nsi with the original Test.ini from CVS 2002-11-09 (with the missing \r's) and nOOns problem reappeared! I guess those line-breaks are more important than I thought.<br />

      </blockquote>yes, that was the problem. I use a notepad replacement called Metapad that can read unix format and didn't realize.<br />
      <br />
      btw, it can change file format with a click (it supports dos, unix and unicode).<br />
