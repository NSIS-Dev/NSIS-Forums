      <br />
      Made build_write_output check for errors on fwrite()<br />
      Fixed bug in WriteRegBin<br />
      Added IfErrors and ClearErrors, and made other instructions set the error flag.<br />
      Added user variables ($0-$9)<br />
      Added StrCpy, StrCmp, ReadRegStr, and ReadINIStr.<br />
      Added /NOCUSTOM switch for InstType<br />
      Cleaned up replace_data/find_data/get_data_offset code a bit (made it find offsets at startup, and update in place - should be more reliable).<br />
      Up to 34k now (ick) - will address soon :)<br />
      Made compiler extract appropriate icon resource from icon files (yay!)<br />
      Made compiler load bmp files for the enabled/disabled bitmaps so that it can resize/decompress if necessary. Files must still be 16 colors, though. Thanks to Ryan Geiss.<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Yet another new version</strong><br />
      I was about to upload a new version of my program with v1.2f. Now I'll have to repackage :)<br />
      Then again, it says this version is more reliable... OK, I'll repackage.<br />
      <br />
      Justin, some suggestions for future versions:<br />
      - DLL version checking. My VB project shows the api calls, but I bet you know how to do it (and won't have to use other people's code like me).<br />
      - Patch technology? It shouldn't have to be very advanced, just that it can recognize a version of a file (CRC), and patch it to a new file by moving large similar blocks around. I made something like this once, but it's in VB (and it's not very advanced - the creator is slow and inefficient, but the patcher itself is very small). It's not really needed, but it could be a nice addon in the future.<br />
      <br />
      Keep up the good work, NSIS rules!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Seriously. NSIS is now starting to give most commercial installers a run for their money (if it didn't in the first place :D ). Not to mention the fact that it gets updates every few days that make it better and better. And it's free. Can't forget that.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Patching would be a great addition.<br />
      <br />
      I know I'll be using NSIS for a LONG time. I'm really glad I found it and more glad that Nullsoft is so F-ING COOL.</p>
