      I dont know if you've heard of Desert Combat but it's a mod for BF1942 and I am a tester for it. I've nearly convinced the Developers to change the installer to NSIS but a bug with 2b3 (error copying block ### to ###) forced an update to v2b4. Unfortunately it seems most of the syntax is different now.<br />
      <br />
      Here's all the gear<br />
      <a href="http://myne.customer.netspace.net.au/Installer/" target="_blank">Here</a><br />
      The gif's are what it used to look like in 2b3, the exe is a baby demo of it(compiled with v2b3), DC2.zip contains the script and the other zip is the picture files.<br />
      I spent some time trying to figure out the changes but I cant seem to make it work. I'd appreciate any pointers or help you can give me - all I want is for it to work the same as it did in v2b3.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance</p>

      <p class="post-content">I had a look at your script and it is a fairly simple. All you really need to change is the page definitions to suit the new style and read the ModernUI Readme to find the right order to define all other parameters, like where you define the special bitmaps, etc.<br />
