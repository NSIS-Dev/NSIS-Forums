      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS Update</strong><br />
      &nbsp; The NSIS Update displays almost everytimes I call it the following error:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
Initializing CVS Update...
<br />&gt;cvs95 update: Empty password used - try 'cvs login' with a real password
<br />cvs95***91;update aborted***93;: Error reading from server cvs.sourceforge.net: 0 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>I use the latest CVS package (yes, sometimes the update works!).<br />
      Is this a bug?<br />

      <p class="post-content">But normally you need a password for the CVS access to sourceforge (i think it's guest).<br />
      And i didn't have any problems accessing other CVS sources from sourceforge via WinCVS.<br />
      <br />
      I think you should at least do not display the following status line<br />
      cvs95 update: Empty password used - try 'cvs login' with a real password<br />
      What about a notice, that Sourceforge is busy and that the user should try later?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's a guest account, and it's limited on SourceForge. It fails with WinCVS and TortoiseCVS too sometimes. It's not limited for your own projects when you supply a login name.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have never ever been able to download the CVS trough NSIS Update. But if <i>it's not limited for your own projects when you supply a login name</i>, wouldn't it be nice if you could just give the updater a username and password? Since I, among others, do have a sourceforge account.<br />
      And, if so, the username and password must be kept when the CVS is downloaded and installed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">B.T.W. What's the difference between the nightly-build-zip and the CVS version?<br />
      <br />
      So why not downloading the zip-version when the CVS refuses after some tries?</p>

      <p class="post-content">CVS just gives you the most updated version. The nightly ZIP is updated about 3 times a day so it's not always the most updated version.</p>

      </blockquote>We'd need a user that had read-only permissions and I don't think we can assign that to a user name on sf.net and so I think we'd need the help of sf to do something like that. However I'm pretty sure they'd deny that request for the very reason that CVS access is restricted in the first place, in order to lessen the load on the sf servers.

      <p class="post-content">virtlink, if you have never been able to get a CVS version, you might have used a snapshot and not an official release. The snapshots contain an internal server name that doesn't work on the internet.<br />
      <br />
      However, the latest NSIS Update version automatically fixes this issue, so it should work now.</p>
