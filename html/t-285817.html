      <p class="post-content"><strong>Confirmation for Download Abort</strong><br />
      Hey guys!<br />
      <br />
      I hope one of you can help me with a little problem I have with my installer.<br />
      <br />
      When running the installer, it checks the users system, if a specific software that is required is installed. If it's not, a pop-up asks the user, whether he wants to download it now.<br />
      For the download I use the InetLoad plug-in, and everything seems to work fine.<br />
      <br />
      But when the user cancels the download, I would like to have another pop-up first, that asks him, if he really wants to quit that download, and he gets to choose Yes or No.<br />
      <br />
      Right now I only managed to prevent him from cancelling, or give the pop-up after the download has been cancelled, telling the user that he has to try again.<br />
      These solutions both are better than the default behaviour, but still not what I would like to see.<br />
      <br />
      Where could I find a solution or tips to solve this problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Your need at least VS6. Find "case IDCANCEL:" in code and add add after first "break"</p>
      <pre>
<code>case IDCANCEL:<br />if(nocancel) break;<br />MessageBox(hDlg, "Are u sure u want to terminate download?", szCaption, MB_YESNO);<br />status = ST_CANCELLED;<br /></code>
</pre>and rebuild plug-in. May be later I'll add this option, looks usefull. And <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in" target="_blank">Inetc</a> looks more stable for me (check parameters - small differences in CLI).

      <p class="post-content">Thank you Takhir for your help!<br />
      <br />
      It took me a while to figure out all the compile errors I got with VS C++ 2008 Express, but finally I managed to rebuild the plug-in, with this nice little extra Messagebox popping up, when someone wants to cancel the DL.<br />
      <br />
      Yet I'm still a bit clueless, how I can than react onto the user input. Right now, it doesn't make a difference, what the user selects. The Download will be aborted after he answers the popup.<br />
      <br />
      I would greatly appreciate if you could tell me, where I can find an answer to this problem, or maybe even some code snippet.<br />
      <br />
      P.S.: Forgive these stupid questions, but I'm fairly new to NSIS</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry, I not tested this code :) Just check value MsgBox returns (replace line):<br />
      if(MessageBox(...) == IDNO) break;</p>

      Now I've got everything working the way I want it to.<br />
