      <p class="post-content"><strong>Write Install Program for $</strong><br />
      I have some software that is installed using Java Web Start. I'd like a .exe install program that I could use to accomplish the install, so I can submit the software to shareware sites. It looks like NSIS can do this. I am also willing to pay a couple bucks (say $20US - yeah, not much, but maybe a quick buck for someone who's already knows NSIS).<br />
      <br />
      I need the following install process:<br />
      1) Has user agree to license.<br />
      2) Checks for JRE and if not installed, prompts user to install (should auto-install 1.4+ as simply as possible, but download should _NOT_ include the JRE since its too big).<br />
      3) Creates shortcut(s) to launch software (an URL)<br />
      4) Launch now option / Exits gracefully.<br />
      <br />
      I see the JRE check is already written:<br />

      <br />
      If you could do this let me know. The software that needs this install program is at:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Did I not say that already?<br />
      <br />
      You're technically correct in saying that shareware is "commercial software", but it's hardly "commercial software" in the sense I'm not charging $500+ a copy.<br />
      <br />
      I did not mean to offend. I've had implementations as responses to posts in the past for free. I just don't mind adding a token reward this time.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The difficult task in this case is the JRE detection and downloading.<br />
      <br />
      To create a really good JRE check, some research about JRE locations and configuration files is necessary. Then, script code has to be created that handles these checks.<br />
      <br />
      A nice dialog would have to be designed to inform the user about the JRE installation status and download options.<br />
      <br />
      And of course the downloading should be handled, include error checks, maybe some download mirrors etc.<br />
      <br />
      When this has finished, the JRE should be installed silently in the background and the return codes or results of the installation should be checked.<br />
      <br />
      And then you still need to test the installer in different situation to make sure it works fine.<br />
      <br />
      Altogether, it will take a few hours, so I think you really can't find someone to do it for just 20 bucks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The JRE check script in the Nullsoft archive is sufficient for my purposes.<br />
      <br />
      A message stating that the JRE download will be downloaded and internet connection needed (with a browser install from javasoft.com) would be fine (it would be the best install anyway). I suppose the install should do a recheck to make sure it was installed. Then shortcut creation is all that's needed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hi<br />
      <br />
      i think the problem is not the money instead JRE itself or someone who has both and some time. u only have 2 find him... (not me)<br />
      <br />
      since i know nsis i did a lot for others including shareware - 4 nothing.<br />
      conclusion now is that i had to suspend work due to some mixes between real and virtual life.<br />
      but if someone asks me i wont deny if i can see light at the end of tunnel.<br />
      <br />
      good luck..</p>

      <p class="post-content">to answer your questions:<br />
      <br />
      <b>1) Has user agree to license.</b><br />
      -&gt; that's a default function of NSIS. just include a license-page. there are 3 possibilities to accept or decline the license:<br />
      radio-buttons, a checkbox, or simply a "accept"-button instead of "next" (all those possibilities are implemented).<br />
      <br />
      <b>2) Checks for JRE and if not installed, prompts user to install (should auto-install 1.4+ as simply as possible, but download should _NOT_ include the JRE since its too big).</b><br />
      -&gt; this is the realy interesting part. the others already said enough, i think.<br />
      <br />
      <b>3) Creates shortcut(s) to launch software (an URL)</b><br />
      -&gt; realy easy.<br />
      a normal with the "CreateShortcut" or an internet shortcut by the "CreateInternetShortcut"-macro from the archive-page (look at my signature).<br />
      <br />
      <b>4) Launch now option / Exits gracefully.</b><br />
      -&gt; available with the modern ui, only few lines of code.<br />
      and this function is also very good documented.<br />
      <br />
      i think, u should at least code #1, #3 and #4 yourself.<br />
      i'm sure u'll get very good help about #2 here in the forums.</p>
