      <p class="post-content"><strong>Executing an executable file</strong><br />
      I want to run the executable file, automatically when the installation is going on. So I used Exec and ExecWait but both are not working. Could some one help me in figuring out this??<br />
      <br />
      It doesn't show any error, but doesn't the files to folder "c".<br />
      <br />
      FYI : The executable file is working fine, I tested it and the executable file is placed in the same folder as this file, so it isn't giving any error information like "File open failed/no such file".<br />
      <br />
      Section "deploy_0.zip"<br />
      SetOutPath "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\c"<br />
      <br />
      ;File sji.exe //If I am uncommenting this, it is jus copying this file to the folder "c" that's it.<br />
      ExecWait ' "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\sji.exe" '<br />
      WriteUninstaller "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Uninstall.exe"<br />
      SectionEnd</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sure, command <b>File sji.exe</b> does nothing but <i>extract</i> "sji.exe" (to the current $OUTDIR).<br />
      <br />
      Also command <b>ExecWait '"C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\sji.exe"'</b> is highly prone to fail! Hardcoded path "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop" will not exist on user's computer with probability of 99.9% ;)<br />
      <br />
      Try this:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>InitPluginsDir<br />File "oname=$PLUGINSDIR\sji.exe" "sji.exe"<br />ExecWait '"$PLUGINSDIR\sji.exe"'<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      This will extract "sij.exe" to a unique sub-folder (will be auto-generated) inside %TEMP% and run it from there. Will also be cleaned-up when the installer exits.

      <p class="post-content">I tried the below code :<br />
      <br />
      Section "deploy.zip"<br />
      InitPluginsDir<br />
      SetOutPath "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\"<br />
      File "oname =${PLUGINSDIR}\sji.exe" "sji.exe"<br />
      ExecWait '"${PLUGINSDIR}\sji.exe"'<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      But I get the following error :<br />
      <br />
      File: "oname =${PLUGINSDIR}\sji.exe" -&gt; no files found.<br />
      Usage: File [/nonfatal] [/a] ([/r] [/x filespec [...]] filespec [...] |<br />
      /oname=outfile one_file_only)<br />
      Error in script "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\wrk\AnalyzingBasic (2).nsi" on line 27 -- aborting creation process<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      But I have sji.exe in the same folder where I have this script, so is it that the code is nt being copied to temp folder??<br />
      And one more question is what exactly does PLUGINSDIR mean? And the TEMP folder you mentioned does it exist or a virtual one??<br />
      <br />
      Sorry for asking so many questions, but I am newbie for NSIS Script :(</p>

      <br />
      $PLUGINSDIR is an internal variable.. so you don't have to define it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thank you for the replies both of you.<br />
      <br />
      I tried with /oname also earlier, but didn't work.<br />
      <br />
      Now why do I need to use the copyFiles option, I don't want to just copy the executable files.<br />
      <br />
      The need the executable file to be executed automatically, because it's like nested executable files.<br />
      <br />
      The below command is working :<br />
      <br />
      ZipDLL::extractall "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\wrk\client_9_6_0_0.zip" "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\c"<br />
      <br />
      Here we are passing the zip file and using this command it is extracting the zip files to "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\c" folder which is what I want exactly.<br />
      <br />
      Previously, what I had done is sji.exe will have all the files in the zip, once extracted it should copy to the folder.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a lot guys for the help.</p>

      Be aware: If the NestedInstaller.exe installer actually extracts+runs yet another EXE file, the <i>ExecWait</i> would wait for the NestedInstaller.exe but <b>not</b> for the child process that NestedInstaller.exe has created.<br />

      </blockquote>So do I get this right? You now package a ZIP file in your NSIS installer? If so, you would have to (1) make your installer extract the ZIP file and (2) extract the actual files from the previously extracted ZIP file using ZipDLL.<br />
      <br />
      <b>BUT:</b> Is there really a good reason why you package a ZIP file (it means you actually have <i>two</i> layers of compression!) instead of just packing the "client" files in your NSIS installer ???<br />
      <br />
      You can do:<br />
      <pre>
<code>;Set path where to extract the "client" files<br />SetOutPath "$DESKTOP\Client"<br /><br />;Now extract those files<br />File /r "client\*.*"</code>
</pre><br />
      This code assumes that the "client" files are located in the sub-folder "client" within the folder where your .nsi file located <i>when the installer is built</i>. With that code there will be no ZIP file needed.<br />
      <br />
      <b><font color="red">Also:</font></b> Get rid of those hardcoded paths like "C:\Users\Niharika\Downloads\Desktop\Tryng\wrk" from your installer! On the users computer "C:\Users\Niharika" won't exist and your installer will fail horribly !!!

      </blockquote>You can extract the ZIP file <i>right at the moment when your installer is being built</i> and then only include the files extracted from the ZIP file.<br />
      <br />
      This could even be automated using the <b>!system</b> built-time command...<br />

      I thought about it later and came to know that it isn't possible. I missed the most silly think that to extract the file it must be present in the executable file and adding all the files increases its size.<br />
