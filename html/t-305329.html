      <p class="post-content">Awesome! I really appreciate you taking time to help with this. But, of course, whenever you say "one last thing" it never is...<br>
      <br>
      I've got the screen working and I can check and uncheck the boxes, and you can no longer go back on the last page. Great! Now, though, I've realised that the code to actually create the shortcuts isn't called for some reason, and they're never created. I'm not sure why, though.<br>
      On a side note, my new page uses the same title and subtext as the previous one. This wouldn't be an issue, except that the previous page is for the Start Menu, and I don't know how to edit the title for that. So I'd like to know if there's a way of changing that title, or fixing the original problem.<br>
      Also, there is a section of code which should mean that the installer waits for the uninstaller to run if the program is already found to exist (using ExecWait). However, both run simultaneously. I think I'm doing something wrong here.<br>
      <br>
      So, I'd like to post my script, but I don't want to use up a lot of screen space. Are there spoiler tags or something similar I can put it in?</p>

      <p class="post-content">you can always attach the script as a file instead (not sure if that is currently available to you or whether you're in some probation period); otherwise, try pastebin.ca (you can put a password and time limit on it, if you want).<br>
      <br>
      all of those problems should be able to be resolved; just a matter of knowing exactly what things you're referring to.. the title bits are probably just the MUI defines/macros you need to insert :)</p>
