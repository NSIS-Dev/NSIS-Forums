      <p class="post-content"><strong>ExecDos and cancel/close (x) buttons</strong><br />
      Hello everyone,<br />
      <br />
      Is it somehow possible to terminate the thread created by ExecDos::exec when the user clicks on the cancel button?<br />
      <br />
      I am using ExecDos::exec to run a perl script that installs some packages from CPAN and displays the progress from console in a multi-line text window. Since the installation can take several minutes, I would like to give the user the opportunity to stop the installation.<br />
      <br />
      I can disable next, back and cancel buttons, but weird things happen also when I use the 'x' in the corner of the installer to close it (and I think that some users might try that if all the other buttons are disabled).<br />
      <br />
      I was also thinking about creating a separate installer for the CPAN packages installation, is there any other function that respects the cancel button? (I've looked at nsExec documentation but haven't found anything useful yet)<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for any suggestions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Stopping in the middle of a Perl script? Is that a good idea? Also why isn't the X button disabled? You're not running your script in a section? This is generally bad practice - the machine should not be touched in any way until the sections are executed. If that is unavoidable the X button can also be disabled (<a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=322433" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=322433</a>).<br />

      <p class="post-content">But to answer your question regarding the Cancel button telling ExecDos to kill its thread; will that even work assuming you could (you can't)? Your Perl script will carry on regardless. You could have some UI for your Perl script with a cancel button on it but I realise that isn't pretty. There isn't really any other way.<br />
