As you can see from the example jpg (first screen of MultiLanguage.nsi), most of the text is in German except:<br><br>"Check the component that you wish to install and uncheck the components that you don't want to install. Click Next to continue"<br><br>This is similar on other pages.<br><br>This text seems to be represented in $NSISDIR\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\German.nsh as MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_TOP:<br><br>"Wählen Sie die Komponenten aus, die Sie installieren möchten und wählen Sie diejenigen ab, die Sie nicht installieren wollen."<br><br>But this text never shows up in the installer. Strangely there is no MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_TOP in the English.nsh.<br><br>This text (or something similar) does appear in $NSISDIR\Contrib\Language files\English.nlf on line 87 under # ^ComponentsText, but editing this doesn't cause any change in the install, so I am assuming that it's not being read from there. I assume it is being written directly from lang.cpp.<br><br>Can someone tell me if this is a known bug? Is it being worked on? Or has the MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_TOP simply changed to something else?<br><br>Part of my confusion may be because I don't really understand the relationshop between German.nsh and German.nlf when using Modern UI.<br><br>Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>Zilch.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th September 2003 14:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">All language files have to be updated for the new language system.

It doesn't mean the contents or the version was updated.
