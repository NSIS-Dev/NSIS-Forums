      <p class="post-content"><strong>"Getting Started?"</strong><br />
      I've just searched this forum and all my help files for NSIS. I've read the entire help file, the supporting web pages, and now I have ... total confusion!<br />
      <br />
      Is there a "getting started" document anywhere?</p>

      Already read it. Twice.<br />

      "NSIS is a module that utilizes a customized scripting language for the purpose of putting together an executable program that will "install" a program package on a PC. The scripting language is really cool because it comes with its own free compiler!<br />
      <br />
      The script files are regular text files that have specific commands and syntax (much like a batch file or a vbscript or javascript program). If the line is too long, you can use a back-slash at the end of the line to control line flow. Also, like several other languages, the scripting language has an INCLUDE feature to include other scripts.<br />
      <br />
      The powerful scripting language has a good, solid structure which includes pages, sections, and functions. There is also a robust macro language to go with it and it will accept *.dll plug-ins."<br />
      <br />
      It really is a nice, pleasant-to-read help file and it really does not even come close to tell me how to get started. :tinfoil:</p>

      <p class="post-content">To get started, just start compiling some code. To compile a script, you can drag and drop a script file to makensisw.exe main window or use an editor like <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/HM_NIS_Edit" target="_blank">HM NIS Edit</a>. There are examples at NSIS\Examples folder to experiment. You might want to have the NSIS documentation open if you want to verify what each instruction does as you change a script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well...I'm going to give you an example.<br />
      You can open the example1.nsi, than open the documentation and start adding stuff to it, such as Icons, DetailPrint, MessageBox, IfFileExists, etc..<br />

      Hey Joel, thanks! When your website is up I'll grab your tutorial and run it through Babelfish... it will probably get me close enough for what I'm looking for.</p>

      </blockquote>Where did you get that quotes from? I can't find it anywhere in the documentation. The <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter2.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a> tells you everything you need to know to get started. It starts with the basics of the scripting language, continues to compiling scripts, and then on to more complex stuff like Modern UI and plug-ins.

      <p class="post-content">The tutorial <i>is</i> a tutorial. It's simply not of the step-by-step-do-this-and-you're-done variety. The "putting it all together" section that you seem to want isn't missing--it's in the form of example scripts!<br />
      <br />
      In answer to your previous question of "To get started, just get started?" the answer is yes. Joel's already told you: the example1.nsi file in the Examples directory will get you started. The tutorial describes what's going on inside that example. And if one of the instructions <i>isn't</i> described in the tutorial, there'll be a section about it elsewhere in the help file. The Index and Search functions are your friend. :)<br />
      <br />
      You aren't being left to your own devices on this. We're perfectly willing to help. But have a little faith in yourself! It's just like swimming: hold your nose and close your eyes (or don't, if you're really daring :cool: ), and jump right in...just make sure you jump in at the shallow end first. :D</p>
