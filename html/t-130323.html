      <p class="post-content"><strong>Automatic NO command to dialog</strong><br />
      I have a modern installer where a .ax file has to registred. I'm doing that with the command:<br />
      <br />
      RegDLL "$SYSDIR\something.ax"<br />
      <br />
      During installation a little dialog appears when the .ax file is registred. I have a choice of choosing YES or NO. But I want the installer to choose for me, so the user wont be interupted with this choice. Is that possible?</p>

      <p class="post-content">So the DLL displays a messagebox? Is it no error message?<br />
      <br />
      A possibility would be to use the System plugin to send a keypress. You would have to check which API call to use.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It is not an error message, but a choice that can be made to config the final AX file or registry (Where ever the changes might be stored)<br />
      <br />
      The thing you mentioned sounds a bit difficult. Do not even know what keypress or API call is, but did not know that is was complicated.<br />
      <br />
      Just thought that there was a commando like the message boxes have when you have a choice of choosing YES or NO.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to RegDLL this file without messagebox</strong><br />
      I have a file that has to be registered within my modern NSIS installer. I use the command RegDLL, and everything goes fine.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">RegDLL "$SYSDIR\DivXdec4.ax"</font><br />
      <br />
      But this .ax file gives a messagebox when registrering, where the user has a choice of YES or NO. (Its not an error box) I want to make a installer where the choice is being made by the installer and not the user, since this will cause confution when different language is included.<br />
      <br />
      The .ax file can be downloaded here: <a href="http://home.no/matricened2/DivXdec4.ax" target="_blank">http://home.no/matricened2/DivXdec4.ax</a> - so you can see what happens. Hope that somebody can help me out.</p>

      <br />
      To your question:<br />
      <br />
      The automatic selection of No solution is far more complicated than I believe you are looking for. I think the best solution for you would be just to consult the creators of this file on a way to registry it silently.</p>

      - not a bad idea, but lets just say...the last! I have seen it in another NSIS installer, so I know that it is possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">AFAIK, on a version that's not 2.* they'd have to use an external program. I suggest you just ask them for this program. I don't currently have the time to explain to you how to write this.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>What to do</strong><br />
      I still trying to solve this problem, but havent found a solution for it yet. So I was wondering if there is a NSIS command that can close the dialog window that appears upon installation (RegDLL).<br />
      <br />
      The dialog contains a question between YES or NO as written before. I does not matter if I cant choose, just as long as the dialog window closes by itself or does not appear at all.<br />
      <br />
      Hope that a solution can be found :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a little plug-in that doesn't let any dialogs to be created (a message box is a dialog). The message box still beeps, but I'm a bit short on time so I went on the easy solution instead of removing the beep too.<br />
      <br />
      Attached with an example. Put the DLL in your plugins directory, do whatever you want with the source.<br />
      <br />
      Make sure you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do not remove the /NOUNLOAD switch</li>

        <li><b>Always</b> call stop</li>

        <li>Do not start the plug-in before you really need it and stop it as fast as you can</li>
      </ul>
