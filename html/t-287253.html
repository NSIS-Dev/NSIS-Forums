      <p class="post-content"><strong>Riched20.dll missing on Target machine</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      I am deploying several NSIS installers successfully since more than two years, but now I encountered a "new", never seen before, error:<br />
      <br />
      After the welcome page, when changing to the license page, the installer suddenly skips, and disappears.<br />
      <br />
      The behaviour only occured on machines that did not have a copy of riched20.dll available.<br />
      <br />
      Is there any way how to make sure this problem cannot occur?<br />
      I mean, either extract the file before it is needed (I don't know how to do this), or make NSIS link the produced exe-setup statically against the missing dll.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for your help in advance,<br />
      <br />
      best regards,<br />
      thegrinch</p>

      </blockquote>I guess you could search/extract for a file within function .onInit.

      <p class="post-content">If riched20.dll is not available NSIS trys to use riched32.dll Which should be available on any "virgin" system from Windows 95 to Vista...<br />
      <br />
      So it should still work if the system has riched32.dll... Unless there's a bug in NSIS or something.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm,<br />
      I unfortunately cannot look into that pc that brought the error. But the guy definitely said, the riched20.dll was mentioned in the message box.<br />
      <br />
      Concerning this .oninit thing, I never had to use this function. Could you give an example, please?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Was it Windows x64? Did you disable redirection in .onInit?<br />
      <br />
      Could be the same as:<br />

      <p class="post-content">no, I did not. I actually don't even use the onInit function. Would installing (or: making sure, it is installed) in .onInit be possible? I mean, it's a question at which time the riched20.dll is loaded.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Better description of the error message would help a lot...<br />
      <br />
      To me it seems that the the system isn't missing riched20.dll, but the riched20.dll is corrupted or something. Googling quickly reveals that corrupted riched20.dll file isn't that far-fetched that it may sound.</p>
