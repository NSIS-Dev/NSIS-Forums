With some effort, you can create two tiny installers for the different languages that will be started by a main (silent) installer. Then these custom installers only record settings to the registry (including a setting for finishing the installer or pressing cancel). After "ExecWait" read all necessary regsettings and perform the task.<br><br>If your program is small, the actual install (extract, copy) will not take so much time. A progressbar is not really needed then. The main installer could just have a background and display a message afterwards. If your program is big, show some message (using an external exe or dll), that the installer is busy.<br><br>Other solutions could well exist, but this was my first idea...<br><br>[edit]<br>Or create an installer of only custom pages using InstallOptions. You can control which version (French/English) of each (small!) ini will be extracted and you display the proper one. Using radionbuttons, checkboxes and dirrequest, you can build an installer!<br>[/edit]<br><br>Good luck,<br>-Hendri.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">posttitle</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th July 2002 12:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">This solutions sound better.. but I really though there was an easiest way to just display diferent sentences on the install windows.<br><br>For exemple, is it possible to make 2 licences windows?<br>If so, can I directly go to the one I want and skip the other, depending of the systeme language?<br><br>Thanks a lot for your help!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Smile2Me</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th July 2002 12:39 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by posttitle</i><br><b>For exemple, is it possible to make 2 licences windows?<br></b></blockquote>No, you could display the different languages in the one lisense window redirecting French people to the lower part of the lisense window at the top. If it is only the LisenseText that you want to have in two languages you can also think of loading the proper text document into Notepad and continue when ExecWait returns.<br><br>But if you also want to have all buttons/strings/etc in two languages, you should create two separate installers / use InstOpts.<br><br>I can remember Justin had the idea to create multilingual support for NSIS, but he is not working on NSIS right now.<br><br>-Hendri.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
