I could use my own command line parameter and just check for it, but then all my message boxes would have to be wrapped in ${If}-${Else} to check for my custom status.<br><br>I want to do this so my users don't try to run the app during the install, know when it's done, and also there are some third party exe's that display a progress bar in their own window. I just don't want the user to have any ability to cancel or change the components if an admin runs it remotely as a silent install.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd April 2008 18:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can't both have it silent and display a progress bar. If you want, the best you can get is to use only the instfiles page and therefore not giving the user any choice.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">AaronLS</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd April 2008 18:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks. That is what I've kind of tested out. I was thinking I could tell my administrators some custom command line switch they could use, and check for that in the prepage functions and hide all but instfiles. Hiding the message boxes were really the only problem with that, so I will just write some macros to wrap around my message boxes that will handle that.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
