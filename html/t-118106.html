      Yes : I searched the forum for this topic, but didn't find anything that fit my problem.<br />
      <br />
      Ok. Ive been using NSIS for some time, but I've never tried to delete files specified by a variable...<br />
      This is what I do in my uninstaller :<br />
      <br />
      Delete $2<br />
      ;where $2 is a filename like C:\crap\myfile.bla<br />
      <br />
      ;I also tried to do :<br />
      Delete "$2"<br />
      <br />
      ;and to envelop the filename in ""'s like :<br />
      ;$2 = "C:\crap\myfile.bla"<br />
      <br />
      but still the file doesn't get deleted...<br />
      The files are not beeing used/open/whatever in any way!!!<br />
      They're not hidden/system files...<br />
      When I specify files directly, or using "$INSTDIR\myfile.bla" it works just fine...<br />
      <br />
      Im used NSIS version 1.98 and then downloaded the new version v2.0b0<br />
      which does the same thing.<br />
      I'm using the old GUI and Windows2000<br />
      <br />
      Help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
      <br />
      KIM</p>

      I can tell you that the variable contains the right file name, as i made some debug output!<br />
      <br />
      I'll state the sections that have to do with deleting the file :<br />
      <br />
      Function un.delete_file<br />
      push $R0<br />
      StrCpy $R0 $2 3 -3 ;get file extension<br />
      StrCmp $R0 "dll" unreg delfile<br />
      StrCmp $R0 "ocx" unreg delfile<br />
      unreg:<br />
      UnRegDLL $2<br />
      delfile:<br />
      Delete "/REBOOTOK" $2<br />
      pop $R0<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      The variable $2 is read from a logfile i create myself, and I am sure the filename is right!!!<br />
      I also tried :<br />
      Delete $2<br />
      Delete "$2"<br />
      and to add " to the filename at the front + back...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry, you edited your post while I was typing ;-)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think the file reading goes wrong. Use StrCpy and check wheather it works.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you, the problem was that I read the "lines" from a file and the $\r$\n didn't get cut correctly, so the files didn't get deleted... Now it works.<br />
      The filenames seemed to be correct, and I didn't notice that the CRLF shouldn't be there.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry for bothering...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Unrelated, but just spotted a bug in your function (might have just been a typo when you wrote the message):<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />   ...<br />   StrCmp $R0 "dll" unreg delfile<br />   StrCmp $R0 "ocx" unreg delfile<br />   ...<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      The second StrCmp will never be executed because the first one branches off somewhere else in all cases.<br />
