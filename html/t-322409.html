      <br>
      Sadly, I don't think I can share the DLL as it is a part of the server installation for the client software I'm managing. I'm pretty sure McAfee's lawyers might grunt in disapproval.<br>
      <br>
      I've ran the DLL through a assembler decompiler in hope I might gleam some insight. I didn't find anything gleamingly obvious but I did get these...<br>
      The Undecorated function name is: "?SBADM_execute@@YAPAGPBGP6AHKPAX@Z@Z"<br>
      The Address is: 0x0001eab0<br>
      The Ordinal is: 0x1<br>
      <br>
      I have no basis except for intuition, but it feels like the issue is with the function name lookup. <s>Can the System plugin call dll functions by the ordinal or address values?</s><i>Looking at the documentation I'll give GetModuleHandle a try and see if it will work.</i><br>
      <br>
      For the time being, I'm using the command-line utility in addition to the DLL. I seams stupid that I'm forced to add an exe wrapper to call an added dll that I would call directly if I knew how. :(<br>
      <br>
      I'm hoping McAfee will provide me with some actual C usage examples so I can get this properly implemented.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Thank you soo much for your assistance.. this one it turning into a problem I'm going to have to solve on my own but your encouraging nudges do help :D<br>
      <br>
      Here is an interesting quip I conjured I feel is partially relevant, "Bugs are only introduced when you implement someone else's code." It's not actually true but I thought it funny.

      <p class="post-content">You should probably call SBADM_free_string to free the returned string (If you only call it once, its probably ok just to leak that memory, but if you call it a lot you might want to free the strings) (But when doing that, the return needs to be i to preserve the pointer, then convert the returned string to a "nsis string" with the system plugin struct syntax)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think I know the answer but I'll ask to verify.<br>
      <br>
      The SBADM_free_string function needed to free the memory doesn't have a return value so I'm uncertain if it succeeded.</p>
      <pre>
<code>void __cdecl SBADM_free_string(unsigned short *}</code>
</pre>I tried reading the memory value again so see if it was cleared, gives me an error, or is different. But the value is exactly the same as it was before the call to release the memory.
      <pre>
<code>
System::Call `*$3(&amp;w${NSIS_MAX_STRLEN} .r4)` 
</code>
</pre>I have two possible conclusions....

      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>The API call to free the memory is failing.</li>

        <li>The API call succeeded but the value was left intact at the address.</li>
      </ol><br>
      #2 worries me as it implies that the DLL developers are leaving potentially private data as plain text in the memory space to be easily scanned.<br>
      <br>
      I'm going to try and create a controlled memory and compare the results of the program to see if it is indeed freeing the memory.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <u><b>UPDATE:</b></u> I see that the FreeLibrary function is freeing the memory but I think the api call is failing as the memory increases about the same with and without the free_string api call. I'm using....
      <pre>
<code>System</code>::Call 'kernel32::GetProcAddress(i r0,i 2)i.r2' ;ordinal 2<br>System::Call '::$2(i $3) ?c' 
</pre><br>
      <u><b>UPDATE:</b></u> I fixed a typo in my code and ran the loops again... The API is indeed releasing the memory as I'm seeing almost a 1MB memory size difference when looping 1000 times with and without the free string function. It looks like the memory is indeed left intact. That sucks.. I suppose I could let McAfee know but is it really an issue or is this common practice?
