So just thnaks you for that.<br>So my question, I generate the setup with Linux version of<br>nsis compiler. In the future I will need to have to make Linux setup too. And I don't want to be dependent of a package system, so no deb or rpm file.<br>For the moment the only tool I found is makeself (the archive in compressed and save under a script shell.<br>we launch this script shell and the data save inside is installed...<br>... but it's not as fun as nsis... So do you have plan to make<br>an Total linux nsis version ?<br>And if not. do you think I should be an hard work to add this support on the linux nsis compiler ?<br><br>Thanks.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Comm@nder21</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd November 2006 16:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">it IS hard, because nsis makes heavy use of winapi and thus the creation of a linux version would need a lot of work, you would basically need to rewrite 'bout 50% of the code i guess.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd November 2006 19:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Besides that, the scripting language is very Windows oriented. What would you have $PROGRAMFILES replaced for? What would you do with registry manipulations? I don't see how a script would be compilable on both Linux and Windows.<br><br>A new version for Linux with other constants and commands would be nice, but I don't want to get into that. It'd take a lot of work and many other solutions already exist.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
