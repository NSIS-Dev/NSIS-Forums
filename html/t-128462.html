      I'm finally getting around to adding this to our installers. Your sample didn't take into account whether or not the section is selected... thought I'd post it in case anyone else finds it of use.<br>
      <br>
      FYI... the registry entry below is basically ignored by Microsoft, at least in my copy of W2K. &lt;sigh&gt; So far as I can tell, Microsoft doesn't have a way to get the size correct in the add/remove programs control panel applet. If anyone has found a way, please let me know!<br>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1159867,00.asp" target="_blank">this article</a> (PCMag.com) covers where the (A)dd and (R)emove (P)rograms (ARP) "EstimatedSize" information is set in the registry and it's under:<br>
      <font color="seagreen">Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Management\ARPCache\&lt;same uninstall key&gt;"</font> under <font color="seagreen">"SlowInfoCache"</font><br>
      (As an aside, doesn't that key make more sense if it was spelt "ShowInfoCache" :weird: )<br>
      <br>
      I modified the code listed by Andrew above, but I ran into a problem I couldn't find a solution to, even reading the NSIS forums and manuals.<br>
      <br>
      The code I came up with is:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code><font color="orangered"><font size="3"><br>; Convert the result to Hex for the ARP cache<br>; It has a format of:<br>; Len  - HasName           - EstimatedSize<br>; 2802 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - &lt;etc&gt;<br>IntFmt $0 "2802000000000000%08X" $2<br>; Then write it to ARP cache<br>WriteRegBin HKLM \<br>"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Management\ARPCache\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}" "SlowInfoCache" $0<br></font></font></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Looks right, no? But the compiler complains and it's because of the "$0" variable. If I just hard code a value instead of $0, it works. I also tried putting quotations around the variable, tried different variables like $R0, etc, but no luck :eek: .<br>
      <br>
      What is wrong? Do I have to define the variable as a hex type? Bug?

      <p class="post-content">No, but after your post, I got the latest release build (Feb 7th, 2004), and alas, the same error. I then got the latest development build (July 21st, 2004) and same thing.<br>

      I tried the code just by itself:<br></p>
      <pre>

      That should work right? But the same error occurs:<br>
      <pre>
<code><font size="3"><br>Usage: WriteRegBin rootkey subkey entry_name hex_string_like_12848412AB<br>    root_key=(HKCR|HKLM|HKCU|HKU|HKCC|HKDD|HKPD)<br>Error in script "C:\MyScripts\test.nsi" on line 8 -- aborting creation process<br></font></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      I thought one factor might be the that I am compiling in HM NIS edit 2.0rc2, but I tried MakenSISW and same thing. Any compile settings, etc. that I should check?<br>

      It would also be cool to get the current time in the "FileTime" format to replace the "FFFFFFFF" which just clear that field.<br>
