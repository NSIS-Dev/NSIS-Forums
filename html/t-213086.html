      <p class="post-content"><strong>MUI - question about grouping</strong><br />
      This seems like it would be very simple, but I can't seem to get it to work:<br />
      <br />
      I have a custom InstallOptions page that has 2 groups of 2 radio buttons (4 radio buttons total). Each group is placed within it's own GroupBox control.<br />
      <br />
      I'm trying to get the 2 groups to work independently--in other words, allow the user to pick one radio button from Group 1 and 1 radio button from group 2.<br />
      <br />
      I know that I probably just need to use the GROUP flag in the InstallOptions INI but I can't seem to get it to work. The InstallOptions help seems a little vague and I've been unable to find any good examples.<br />
      <br />
      Does someone out there perhaps have a small example of how to properly format the install options INI file?<br />
      Thanks! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmmm... that's what I thought, but so some reason, it's not working...<br />
      <br />
      Could this be a problem:<br />
      Currently, I don't have both groups next to each other chonogoically. For example, each set has 3 fields: a groupbox and 2 radio buttons. But I have each group in different places in the ini file. (For example, group 1 is entered as fields 4-6 and group 2 is entered as fields 9-11. I would assume that they don't need to be all together--am I wrong?<br />
      <br />
      Since I've got so much underlying code, it's hard to change the fields without breaking the main script. Therefore, I'll try to create a "scaled down" example to see where it's actually breaking.<br />
      <br />
      In the meantime, I'm open for any other suggestions!<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!</p>

      </blockquote>InstallOptions is a little bit limited when talkin' about groups. The "GROUP" flag should only be used near the end of the INI file. Why? It groups all controls after the control where it's used and the control itself.<br />
      <br />
      InstallOptions uses the simplest way from the developer side to group controls. Maybe I'll have a look on it in future releases of InstallOptionsEx, when I start implementing Tab controls.

      <p class="post-content">I've done some quick tests with a dummy install/installoptions.ini and of course it works! :mad:<br />
      <br />
      I'll start on tweaking my install to move the 2 groups near the end as you suggested.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks to both for the help!:D</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, I found my problem. (and a bonehead problem at that!)<br />
      <br />
      I was using a default installoptions.ini which I then modified using a special function inside my install. I initially had the 2nd group disabled and then only enable it if I find user has option XYZ on their computer.<br />
      <br />
      The problem was that when toggling the enabled flag, I failed to include the GROUP flag!<br />
      (D'OH!)</p>
