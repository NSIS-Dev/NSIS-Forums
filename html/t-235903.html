      <p class="post-content"><strong>Installing a DLL based on date instead of version</strong><br />
      I've been using InstallLib quite successfully to copy over DLLs. I'm using a common directory where multiple installers will update a set of common DLLs.<br />
      <br />
      It has become necessary (or at the very least desireable) to have the DLLs upgraded by DATE instead of relying purely on VERSION as I have in the past.<br />
      <br />
      I've done a search of the forums for a way to go about handling this, but I have not found a commonly used way. Perhaps it's unusual to do this or I'm missing something glaringly obvious.<br />
      <br />
      Could someone please point me in the right direction?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Kris</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can use SetOverwrite ifnewer. If you want to have it check both the version and the date, you'd have to make some changes to the Library macros.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks kichik! Unfortunately, that's exactly what I wanted to do. I was hoping that it would be just another option with InstallLib like it is in InstallShield.<br />
      <br />
      I guess I'll have to roll up my sleeves and dive into the Library macros afterall.<br />
      <br />
      Are there any plans for adding this in the future or is it still to niche?</p>

      </blockquote>No, but if you submit a patch, I'll consider including it.
