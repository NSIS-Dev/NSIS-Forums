I then do what Afrow UK suggested on some other miscellaneous files that QA complained about. All else I use the /REBOOTOK flag when removing. Then from the installer, I check the install directory against any strings located in the remove-on-reboot registry key located at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager, key is PendingFileRenameOperations, and remove them from here so that on reboot they won't be deleted if the end-user re-installs the application without a reboot.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
