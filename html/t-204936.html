      <p class="post-content"><strong>Globalization of install files</strong><br />
      Our application has many international users. I've got the installer working for multiple languages and have included them all in the installer. But I would like to know how to define the messages I have for the message boxes etc in other languages.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I do believe I figured out the answer to my own question.<br />
      <br />
      LangString VAR_NAME ${LANG_ENGLISH} "text goes here."<br />
      <br />
      Now what kind of bugged me. Was the multiple language install example script didn't use this AT ALL. It makes a vague reference to it while setting up a description, but doesn't utilize it.<br />
      <br />
      It wasn't until I gave up on my language question and went to look up what the description thing was all about when I found the LangString reference.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try to switch system language preferenses to every included language before launching uninstaller (or installer) - and you will see, that all messages will be in right language.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Take a look at Exampes\languages.nsi. Almost all of the first 100 lines of it is for defining language strings.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Perhaps you guys missed it:<br />
      <br />
      <i>I've got the installer working for multiple languages and have included them all in the installer.</i><br />
      <br />
      That was all from MultiLanguage.nsi which was helpful in that respect. My problem was that certain messages were defined by me in message boxes etc.. These messages show up in English regardless of the language used.<br />
      <br />
      There is no reference in MultiLanguage.nsi on how to use LangString to provide your own translated strings.<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps I'm not looking at the right file.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Perhaps I'm not looking at the right file.
      </blockquote>Look at the languages.nsi script in the Examples folder. This script displays some message boxes using "translated" strings.<br />
      <br />
      Here are some fragments from that script:
      <pre>
<code>LangString Message ${LANG_ENGLISH} "English message"<br />LangString Message ${LANG_DUTCH} "Dutch message"<br />LangString Message ${LANG_FRENCH} "French message"<br />..<br />..<br />MessageBox MB_OK $(Message)</code>
</pre>
