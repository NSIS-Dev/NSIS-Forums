      <p class="post-content"><strong>Resize nsDialogs window</strong><br />
      Hi!<br />
      <br />
      I've been looking for it a lot in this forum and in Google and didn't find the exact answer I was looking for...<br />
      <br />
      I created an installer using nsDialogs after reading that InstallOptions got deprecated. Everything went well so far but now I'd like to resize the window. I did modify dialog 105 in modern.exe with ResHacker, but it doesn't change anything in nsDialogs.<br />
      <br />
      So, is it possible to modify the size of the window in any way for nsDialogs? Where does nsDialogs gets its dimensions from?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">IIRC nsDialogs gets its size from the child control id you pass when you create the dialog, normally 1018</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for your replies.<br />
      <br />
      I do know how to use ResHacker, but I didn't find the file I need to hack. In NSIS\Contrib\UIs, I tried every executable and only found 1033 controls.<br />
      <br />
      It looks like there are no such things as 1018 or 1044 controls in modern.exe or standard.exe or even nsDialogs.dll...<br />
      <br />
      Could you please tell me where I find these controls?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I found it now. So I modify the dimensions from ResHacker, only for 1018 and 1044 in C:\%ProgFiles%\NSIS\Contrib\UIs\modern.exe, dialog 105.<br />
      <br />
      But when I launch my NSIS script (which uses nsDialogs::Create 1018), nothing changes. It looks like it doesn't take into account any changes in modern.exe because even if I delete it, it doesn't say anything and opens always with the same dimensions.<br />
      <br />
      Anders and ZmAn3, are you talking about nsDialogs or MUI?<br />
      Do I have to do something more to indicate to NSIS to take new changes into account?<br />
      Do I have to modify other values than just 1018 and 1044 width and height?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you! Your help is much appreciated!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Adding MUI2 and an instFiles page resolved my problem!</strong><br />
      Thank you very much ZmAn3! Your script helped me a lot! :up:<br />
      <br />
      I wasn't using an InstFiles page, so NSIS didn't execute the install section. I did it on purpose since I didn't want any instFiles page, but I didn't know it wouldn't accept to show a custom UI in this case. So I added some lines to add an InstFiles page with MUI and it did the trick :<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>!include "MUI2.nsh"<br /><br />!define MUI_UI "myCustomUI.exe"<br /><br />!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Then, to go back to where I was before (no instFiles page), I added a code which makes my installer quit before loading instFiles page, just as it was doing before :<br />
      <pre>
<code>!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE instFilesPre     <font color="DimGray">; Just before "!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES"</font><br /><br />Function instFilesPre<br />    Quit<br />FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      All my code is executed in the leave function of my previous custom page, not in install section.<br />
      So now I can resize the UI with ResHacker or ResEdit the way I want it and NSIS takes it into account when compiling! :D<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again!<br />
      <br />
      Bye<br />
