Windows asks what program you'd like to open the file with instead (this is with the latest beta/pre-release version).<br><br><br>As for the scripting:<br><br>Converting my old MUI script automatically by using <b>!include "XPUI.nsh"</b> instead of <b>!include "MUI.nsh"</b> didn't work fully.<br>I got a lot of error messages about defines that were alrady defined. This was because of the different ways the install and uninstall macros/defines look and can be placed/named in the script between MUI and XPUI. No biggie though. I've been reading your Documentation, and found the solutions to those errors.<br><br>Now I'm stuck at the very end of my script, because I have Section Descriptions even in the uninstaller. If I put <b>XPUI_UNFUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN</b>, I get the error on compile that this macro doesn't exist. If I then remove the <b>UN</b> part, so it says XPUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN, then I get the error below:<br><br></p><pre>
<code><br>!insertmacro: XPUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN (Start Description Function) (macro:XPUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN:4)<br>Error: Function named ".onMouseOverSection" already exists.<br>Error in macro XPUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN on macroline 7<br>Error in script "K:\Blah blah\blurb\Hello\Installers\MYINSTALLER\ExUI_setup_19.nsi" on line 4897 -- aborting creation process</code>
</pre><br>
      (name/path changed)<br>
      <br>
      I have used the XPUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_END macro after the install Section Descriptions (and also these uninstall descriptions). I do not have a custom .onMouseOverSection function.<br>
      <br>
      -So how do I put UNinstaller Section Descriptions in there?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks. :)
