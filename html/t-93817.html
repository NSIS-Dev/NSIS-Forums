Recompile the source and then you can use the commands LogSet and LogText. These options are not installed by default since not so many people use them and they increase the size of the exehead when turned on.<br><br>-Hendri.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JWB</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2002 09:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">:eek:<br>is there a place to download a binary where the flag is set?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2002 10:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Not that I'm aware of. If you really can't do it yourself I could build you a version with that flag set, I'll need to know which version of NSIS you would want a build of.

It did give me some trouble though, it didn't create the file sometimes and I don't know why. However at the time I was changing so much so fast in my installer that I was probably just doing something stupid 'cause it definitely worked at least once.<br><br>One caveat - I used 2.0a0 when I tried the logging, I've no idea if maybe some problem with it was fixed since 1.98 - anyone who knows more care to venture an opinion?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">treaz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2003 23:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hi,<br>To make it simple, can anyone tell me how to Recompile the source so that I can use the commands LogSet and LogText.<br>Thanks.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2003 23:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You need Microsoft Visual Studio 6, preferably with the service packs installed. It *might* work with VC7 but I wouldn't bet on it.

I figured it would not really be worth the effort to do the re-compilation.
