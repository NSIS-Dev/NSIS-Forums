      <p class="post-content">I'd do this myself but (1) I'm not a very good C programmer, and (2) I don't have 3 billion dollars for M$es damn C compiler :)<br />
      <br />
      1) When doing an install in NT/2K, it would be nice to be able to say "install to ALL users" - by default the installer only does the logged in user. Not real sure how to implement this one tho. I'd assume a new <i>$variable</i>, but you'd also need to be able to differentiate the install in the script.<br />
      <br />
      2) I need to install some font files. I think I can just drop them to the fonts directory, but that isn't necessarily easy, since a user can remap the fonts folder using the shell namespace. I wanted to add a <i>$FONTDIR</i> variable, but here I get stopped by my lack of a compiler. The <b>BETTER</b> solution here was be a pseudo-variable that can reference the shell folders. There's already a helper function in util.c to do the lookup, but you'd need a variable like this to do the callout:<br />
      <br />
      <i>$SHELLFOLDER(Fonts)</i><br />
      <br />
      It would just pass "Fonts" to the queryShellFolders helper function and return that as the result. Naturally, this would suck if it blew up, but that could maybe just dump the value of <i>$TEMP</i> into a failed request.<br />
      <br />
      Any thoughts?</p>

      <p class="post-content">These are both things that I've wanted to do at one time or another, and ended up using batch files, and other convoluted ways of getting around the problem!<br />
      <br />
      So I think they're both excellent ideas!</p>
