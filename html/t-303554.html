It's impossible the macro is infected. What is possible and even likely is that they have a signature for an installer with the license page in it. When you don't use the license macro, the license page is removed from the installer and therefore modifies the installer's signature.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">skiyaladerer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th March 2009 22:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Ok, thanks kichik.<br><br>On another note.
