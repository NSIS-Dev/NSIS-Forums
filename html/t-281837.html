      <p class="post-content"><strong>installer crash when launching Windows Explorer when MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES is displayed</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I'm displaying MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES as the last page of my installer. Before I click the "Close" button, if I *manually* launch Windows Explorer (e.g. via the start menu or Windows-e), the installer executable crashes.<br />
      <br />
      The error message is a typical program crash dialog, "setup.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close." If I click for more info it doesn't tell me much (ModName: unknown).<br />
      <br />
      After upgrading to NSIS 2.33, I still see the problem. When I create a simple default installer with MUI dialogs, I don't see this problem. With an older version of my setup I don't see this problem either, and I'm pretty sure I didn't change anything in the NSIS script since then (I was on NSIS 2.31 but wasn't able to repro with a simple script either). I was able to repro this problem on several machines.<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas / suggestions before I start stripping out lines from my 2000+ line script?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">It's probably a plug-in which is loaded in .onInit or .onGUIInit and isn't properly disabled before the installer exits. Start by striping those lines to see who's at fault.</p>

      <p class="post-content">After quite a bit of scrambling I got lucky and found that a DLL I'm registering during the install process is causing the NSIS installer to crash.<br />
      <br />
      This particular DLL is (statically, I think) loading gdiplus.dll during registration. I used a dependency tool (depends.exe) to monitor the installer process and saw that GDIPLUS.DLL is unloaded after registration.<br />
      <br />
      Later, when I move the installer window around after it has completed the install, it crashes. I believe this is because NSIS is using gdiplus.dll. Now, my opinion is that I'm doing something wrong in the self-registration code of the DLL where I'm unloading gdipluss.dll while it is still being used by the installer (when I say 'I' I mean my developer).<br />
      <br />
      Can anyone more experienced with self registering DLLs give me some advice?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Also, my current workaround that works is to use regsvr32 instead of UnRegDLL / InstallLib.</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS isn't using gdiplus.dll. Registration is nothing but calling DllRegisterServer. What makes you think gdiplus.dll is the culprit?</p>

      <p class="post-content">While in some ways I am shooting in the dark here, here are a few things in particular I've noticed that seem to hint at gdiplus:<br />
      <br />
      - Between a Friday build where we didn't see the problem and a Monday build where we did see the crash, very little has changed in our application except adding of the gdiplus depedency.<br />
      - Once when I saw the crash, there was an error message pointing to "GDI Plus Window".<br />
      - If I just wait on the final installer page there is no crash until either A) I start moving the installer window around or B) open up another window of a different app while the installer is running. This makes me think it's a UI related problem since nothing in the script is running at this point.<br />
      <br />
      Take these bullets in combination with there being no crash when using regsvr32.exe and the fact that the installer code has not changed.<br />
      <br />
      Of course, at this point this is still basically speculation.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Also, you're right, NSIS doesn't use gdiplus.dll... I did some investigation and when I don't register our DLL, gdiplus.dll is never loaded by the installer. user32.dll (which NSIS does use) does point to gdiplus.dll but as a delay-load module that never is referenced, which shouldn't cause a problem.<br />
      <br />
      So it is a mystery to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd start by getting a stack trace of the crash using windbg and some symbols.</p>
