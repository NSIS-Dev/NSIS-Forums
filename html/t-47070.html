      <p class="post-content">I have compiled an installation that uses the DLLRegisterServer function, and it works fine with Windows 2000 SP1 machines (Mfc42.dll 6.0.8665.0), but when a client runs it on an NT 4.0 SP4 machine (Mfc42.dll 4.2.xxxx) they receive the following error when the install program tries to register a DLL:<br />
      <br />
      Olemainthreadwndname:<br />
      Ordinal 6663 could not be located in the DLL Mfc42.dll<br />
      <br />
      Is this because the Mfc42.dll is too old on the client's machine? I did not think this installer had a reference to the MFC, but mabye I'm wrong. Can anybody help? Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Saw this was posted two years ago. I've actually run into now. Is it from out of date MFC42 DLL?</p>

      <p class="post-content">If I remember correctly, the problem was an out of date Mfc42.dll. I was able to rename the old version, then copy the newer version from a Win2k box, then reboot the NT4 machine, and then it worked (I think). That was a while ago so I can't remember exactly how I resolved the issue.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No I don't use RegDLL anywhere in my script. At least not to my knowledge. Could be it's hidden away in a macro or something but I doubt it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Correction, I used to call RegDLL to register a DLL but I no longer use that. I now only have a call to UnRegDLL to get rid of the DLL I was formerly registering. Could that cause the problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">When installing an MFC application you should make sure the computer you're installing to has the right MFC version. IIRC Microsoft provide pre-built installers for MFC, so you can get one from MSDN and install it if the MFC dll version doesn't match your plug-in expectations.</p>
