      <p class="post-content"><strong>Graphical Installer problem with custom buttons</strong><br />
      &nbsp; I just shifted to include the Graphical Installer plugin in my installer, but I have a problem regarding buttons. I made a test with my code, and everything worked fine, except for a couple of warning messages.<br />
      <br />
      "SkinnedControls error: T."<br />
      and<br />
      "Color of button text has wrong format, check the GRAPHICAL_INSTALLER_BUTTONS_TEXT_COLOR and GRAPHICAL_INSTALLER_BUTTONS_TEXT_COLOR_DOWN defines."<br />
      <br />
      I have already checked those defines, and they seem fine. The custom .bmp for my buttons skin is size 47x45 px according to instructions, and I left the default text color for them (0xFFFFFF), but I still get those 2 error windows while running the installer.<br />
      <br />
      Also, I checked and tried the included examples, but they have the same problem. Has anybody had this same problem?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi.<br />
      Solution is simple:<br />
      If you use standard NSIS use Standard SkinnedControls plugin<br />
      If you use UNICODE NSIS use Unicode SkinnedControls plugin.<br />
      <br />
      These plugins are available to download here from forum, but I also sent you a link.<br />
      <br />
      There are some problems related to Unicode NSIS - <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=326288" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=326288</a> and thus SkinnedControls plugin has two versions: Unicode and NonUnicode.<br />
      Mixing them with NSIS may result in this error.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have another problem related to SkinendControls and I hope someone can help me.<br />
      When I pop-up a messagebox, the buttons on the UI become un-skinned again, so I have this ugly effect of unskinned buttons on a nice UMUI interface...<br />
      I tried rerunning the plugin after the messagebox but apparently you can only run it on guiInit<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas?</p>

      </blockquote>This problem is related to SkinnedControls, UMUI or Graphical Installer does not affect it.<br />
      I suppose that calling skinning method from plugin might work, but the plugin lacks of method for skinning single control.<br />
      I will have a look on it.

      SkinnedControls.dll and source is attached (non Unicode, converted to VS 2008)<br />
      <br />
      All you need is to call <b>exactly</b> this message always you want to redraw buttons.<br />
      <pre>
<code>
    SendMessage $HWNDPARENT ${WM_MENUDRAG} 0 0 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>e.g.:<br />
      <pre>
<code>MessageBox MB_OK "This message causes SkinnedControls bug..." ; ; After clicking OK the buttons lost their skin<br />SendMessage $HWNDPARENT ${WM_MENUDRAG} 0 0 ; Force reskin</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      I used WM_MENUDRAG message [which is normally unused] to notify window to put another refresh message into queue -&gt; to force redrawing. See the source code how it works.
