      <p class="post-content"><strong>WriteINIStr creates new files, but won't update existing</strong><br />
      I'm creating a desktop shortcut to distribute to our applications users but I've noticed it only creates a new file if you change the filename you are passing to a filename not yet used. When its a new .URL filename, it creates a new .URL file with the current data. If I keep using the old .URL filename, it doesn't update the file that already exists. Even if I delete the old .URL file manually and even clear my recycle bin and then I run the script again, if I'm re-using a file name, it manages to create the old file with old url again. I've tried this in XP and Windows 7. Do I need to do something with temp files? I haven't seen that in anyone elses code. Thanks! I've been trying to figure out this final detail for hours. Here's the excerpt of the code:<br />
      <br />
      Section "" ;No components page, name is not important<br />
      !macro CreateInternetShortcut FILENAME URL ICONFILE ICONINDEX<br />
      nsislog::log "c:\logfile.txt" "Creating Internet shortcut."<br />
      WriteINIStr "${FILENAME}.url" "InternetShortcut" "URL" "${URL}"<br />
      WriteINIStr "${FILENAME}.url" "InternetShortcut" "IconFile" "${ICONFILE}"<br />
      WriteINIStr "${FILENAME}.url" "InternetShortcut" "IconIndex" "${ICONINDEX}"<br />
      !macroend<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro CreateInternetShortcut \<br />
      "$DESKTOP\Econ 3" \<br />
      "http://mysite" \<br />
      "$SYSDIR\favicon.ico" "0"<br />
      <br />
      SectionEnd ; end the section</p>

      <p class="post-content">Is it possible that you are encountering a problem with quotation marks? What happens if you change the filename parameter from "$DESKTOP\Econ 3" to "$DESKTOP\Econ3" ?<br />
      <br />
      What about changing the quotation marks in the macro from " (quotation marks) to ` (Grave Accent) ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the input! I'm actually using Windows XP and 7, not 98, but I ran with your ideas and tried putting flushini before, then after, and a delete. I also changed it to no spaces in the file name and tried single quotes and ` in the macro. No luck :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">nevermind, I figured it out! If i delete the exe before I recompile, it will update the .url file I'm creating/modifying :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i figured something else out, although its not a solution. In both XP and Windows 7, if I delete the .URL file AND reboot, when I run the .exe if creates a new .URL file. So i figured out a way to make it work, but thats not user friendly. If I only delete the .URL file, or only reboot, then run the .exe, the .URL file is still what it was before the delete or reboot.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try creating the URL file in your install directory and creating a shortcut to that instead. Perhaps because it is on the desktop it is cached in some way.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, I tried a different directory to install the URL shortcut to. That didn't resolve it either. I think this is solved though. I noticed that the file is actually being updated with the right http path each time, because theres a file preview in Windows 7. I had been testing by right clicking and looking at properties, which isn't updating for some reason, but I guess thats just life.</p>
