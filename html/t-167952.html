He mentions that Winamp 2.9 - which was distributed in a package built by NSIS 1 - exhibits this problem and there is nothing that can be done about it (this is all according to him, btw).<br><br>Even if this case, I don't see why he is using an older version of NSIS. But my opinion remains that this is too stupid of a bug to have slipped through without a workaround.<br><br>Was this really an issue in NSIS 1? Looking at the uninstall regkey for the application in question, it simply seems to be a matter of renaming the uninstaller file. The actual uninstaller is called "uninstall.exe", but the regkey (created during the installation done by NSIS) points to a file called "uninst.exe". Would this not be solvable by simply correcting the filename in the installation script?<br><br>Any help would be appreciated!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2004 22:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">There has never been such an issue.<br><br>The Add/Remove programs entry it not even related the the NSIS executable itself, it's just a simple registry key.<br><br>So you are right, it's the filename in the script that is wrong.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">xiceburnx</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2004 22:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">As always, thanks for your prompt reply.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
