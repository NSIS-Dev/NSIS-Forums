Is this normal behaviour, or am I missing something?<br><br>Although this works, another problem pops up, and that is that it takes about 30 seconds for the page to load after clicking on next in the previous page! I immediately see the header text, but the rest of the dialog keeps displaying the data from the previous dialog for about 30 seconds. When the dialog should not be displayed, the next page is displayed half for 30 seconds before being displayed correctly.<br><br>Does anyone know what the problem is or have suggestion on how to solve it?

      <p class="post-content">That is much cleaner code. Thanks a lot.<br>
      <br>
      But ... I just found out that the 30 seconds delay is still present but now at the end after I press finish. The page goes white, it looks like it 'hangs' and then after about 30 seconds it closes. While I prefer to wait 30 seconds at the end instead of somewhere in the middle, I would rather not wait at all :-)\<br>
      The delay is also present when I don't select any components.<br>
      <br>
      I do ReserveFile now, as you suggested, although the purpose of that was to speed up page loading and I guess it has nothing to do with closing the installer.<br>
      <br>
      Any thoughts?<br>

      <p class="post-content">I emptied all sections and the installer closes quickly. After putting the code back into 4 of the 7 sections, I again get a delay, but now only about 5 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      So, apparently the more sections (or the more I do in them?), the bigger the delay gets. I don't select any components, so the sections are not executed.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, I find out which line causes the delay and I think also why but not how to get around it.<br>
      I have the following line inside a section:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>    File /r /x *.svn .\target\distribution.dir\distribution\*.*<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Without this line, the installer builds much faster and the delay upon closing is gone. With this line included the delay is back. When the component is selected, then the delay at the end is also gone.<br>
      <br>
      So, what happens is that the installer unpacks all these files and that causes the delay. When the component/section is selected, then the delay is ok, because it is just part of the installation of that component.<br>
      <br>
      However, when the component is not selected and the section is therefore not executed, the installer apparently still unpacks all the files after pressing the finish button, hence the delay.<br>
      The question is why? And how do I solve this? Is there a better way than what I'm doing now?<br>

          The installer executable gets somewhat bigger, but the delay is gone, and that is much more important. The question still remains why the files get extracted, even when the installer does not need them because the section that copies them is not selected.<br>

          <p class="post-content">I'm no expert on the matter but if the installer needs to access a file which has been compressed last, it needs to decompress the entire block that contains that file to access it. You should probably try and contact kichik if you want to know the real details (but he's not around much now). Maybe just avoid /SOLID then but this is not really a solution.

          My company does not allow me to put our own files on the internet, but I don't think you will need my files. I think any file of 20 MB or so will do, just copy it ten times, and then you will have a similar situation. The more files, the bigger the delay will be obviously. (The installer includes jre-win32.exe and apache-activemq.zip, 16 and 32 MB in size respectively, so you could download and use them).<br>

              <br>
              Stu Moving the page functions back doesn't work. It turns out that both problems are not related. I just hadn't noticed the delay before because I never tested what happened when no component was selected.<br>
              <br>
              In the pluginsdir only the system.dll is present, and reserving it does not help.<br>
              <br>
              I can reserve all big .exe/.zip/.jar/.war files in the distribution that are copied with before mentioned "FILE /r ..." command, but that does just move the delay from the end of the installer to the beginning. When I then start the installer it takes 30 seconds before the first installer page is shown, so that is even worse. I found a similar topic (<a href="http://forums.winamp.com/archive/index.php/t-202654.html" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/archive/ind.../t-202654.html</a>), but the main question there remains also unanswered.<br>
              <br>
              So, no matter what I do, I can not prevent the extracting of files, even when the code that actually copies them is inside an unselected section and is not executed.<br>
              <br>
              This behaviour seems very strange to me and I cannot believe that there is no solution for it. But unfortunately I cannot find it.<br>
