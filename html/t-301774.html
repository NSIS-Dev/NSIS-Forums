      It works with NSIS Unicode 2.38-1 but not with NSIS Unicode 2.42<br>

      It also works with the regular NSIS 2.42 (non Unicode)<br>

      <p class="post-content">Ok i have looked into it some more, i am building the same script with NSIS 2.42 (Unicode and not)<br>
      <br>
      NSIS 2.42 will recognize XP, Windows 2003 Server and Windows 2008 Server<br>
      <br>
      NSIS 2.42 Unicode will only recognize XP but not 2003 or 2008<br>
      <br>
      Funny enough the WinVer of the 2.42 Unicode Version will recognize a W2K3 Server as Windows XP .....<br>
      <br>
      I have now replaced the 2.42 WinVer with the one from 2.38 and it works for my purposes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hrm, I'm not sure why you are getting an error. I just did a few sample tests myself and it works fine. There has been quite a bit of changes in how include files are used from 2.38 to 2.42. Could that be the problem? Can you try writing a very simple NSI script that reproduces the problem? And this may be a dumb question but "how about completely uninstalling 2.38?" Are all the files gone? Are you including the right WinVer.nsh and not a copy?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It might work, but the current WinVer is pretty new, 2.38 would be the old one where as you said, 2003 = XP and 2008 = Vista SP1<br>
      <br>
      Unless you need to specify GetVersionExW in the unicode version, I could see no problems with the one from 2.42</p>

      WinVer.nsh Version 2.38 DOES NOT WORK<br>

      I have also build on a machine that has never had any NSIS installed on it.<br>

      @Anders<br>
      At this moment i only need to recognize if the machine ist a 2003 Server and that works fine... the 2003 = XP happens with the 2.42 WinVer.nsh

      So you cannot distinguish a R2 from a non R2 using Version and Build number :(<br>

      should display "FooB" but only displays "Fo" (&amp;w is also broken) so I'm guessing you end up with wrong offsets in the OSVERSIONINFO struct, so it can't check the product type and so Win2003 is converted to XP (XPx64=5.2 workstation)

      <p class="post-content">Well, on second thought, the documentation for System does say that the special character '&amp;' should be used to describe BYTES of things. So &amp;tN = N bytes of text. &amp;wN = N bytes of Unicode text. &amp;gN = N bytes of GUID. Should this be changed for the case of &amp;wN and &amp;tN so that it is a count of characters? That's sort of what we assume all the time.</p>

      You were completely right Jim, almost everything works except finding the difference between 2003 and 2003 R2 i have tested this on a 2003 Standard and a 2003 R2 X64 server these are the only two i have at hand right now.<br>
