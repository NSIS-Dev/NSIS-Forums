Actually i have one page defined by me apart from the provided pages. I is designed as it consist of 4 text boxes in it. When i start my installer, the default pages appears immediatly whereas the page defined by me takes noticeble amount of time to display properly. Is there any way to make it to appear as faster as the default pages.<br>With Thanks, Eka S.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2003 14:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Built in pages are created from resources and Windows has optimized functions to load them.

This means that the files are placed at the beginning of the installer, wich may slow the loading of the installer a little bit down, but makes the installer itself much faster.<br>To reserve the files, use:<br></p><pre>
<code>ReserveFile "${NSISDIR}\Plugins\InstallOptions.dll"
<br>&gt;ReserveFile "MyIni.ini" 
</code>
</pre>B.t.w. I've also tested the script without ReserveFile, and it makes no noticeable difference in the loading time of the page. (I must say that these results are from a between Release 2.0b2 and release 2.0b3 CVS version, but that should make any difference).

      <p class="post-content">The documentation explains this command very well:<br></p>

      <blockquote>
        Reserves a file in the data block for later use. As files are added in the order they are used in the script files that are used in the .onInit function, for example, might be added last and slow the loading of the installer. This is where this command comes useful, allowing you to speed up the loading process by including the file at the top of the data block instead of letting NSIS seek all the way down to the bottom of the compressed data block.
      </blockquote>This means that if you have a lot of compressed data and you put the INI file at the end of it even though it's called first the loading time of the INI file will greatly increase. To prevent this you can use ReserveFile at the top of your script which will cause the INI file to be placed at the top of the data block and allow the installer to quickly extract it without seeking through a lot of compressed data.
