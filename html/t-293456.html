      I ran "scons" from a "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt" and that's where it gave me the above output when I tried to run cl.exe. Trying to run cl.exe from a "normal" command prompt it says it can't find cl.exe. So I added the path to cl.exe to %PATH%, rebooted the computer, and reran scons but still got the same error. Running cl.exe from a normal cmd prompt gave a different result though. Now I get a messagebox saying cl.exe can't find mspdb80.dll (it used to say it couldn't find cl.exe)</p>

      I actually got fairly far with help from Jim Park, but the build process reached the point where all of the header files couldn't be found unless I modified all of the include statements to have an absolute path to the location of the header file.

      <p class="post-content">Also, installing MSVS 2008 causes Scons to find it instead of MSVS 2005. This is a problem because Scons currently can't handle MSVS 2008. So Dave, when I said my build system was messed up, I was encountering the same problem you were. I had to actually hack Scons to make it find my copy of MSVS 2005 instead of trying to use MSVS 2008. I emailed you a logging build of Unicode NSIS. I hope that works for you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">For those of you trying to build the logging version of NSIS using MSVS 2005, here's the little edit you'll need to do in your \Scons\Config\ms file. Basically, you need to skip the libcp test because from MSVS 2005 on, there is no longer any need to link to the single threaded version of the runtime library. The linker will automatically link it in for you if you need it.<br>
      <br>
      So in around line 43, you'll need to wrap the whole check in a if MSVS_VERSION &lt; 8.0 check:<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br># For VS 2005 and up, the single threaded version of C runtime<br># need not be explicitly linked.<br>if float(defenv['MSVS_VERSION'].replace('Exp','')) &lt; 8.0:<br>  libcptest = """<br>  #include &lt;fstream&gt;<br>  int main() {<br>    // %s<br>    std::ofstream header("test", std::ofstream::out);<br>    return 0;<br>  }<br>  """<br><br>  conf.env.PrependENVPath('LIB', Dir('#/.sconf_temp').abspath)<br>  conf.env.Append(CCFLAGS = ['$EXCEPTION_FLAG'])<br><br>  if not conf.TryLink(libcptest % 'no change', '.cpp'):<br>    import os, shutil<br><br>    libdirs = defenv['ENV']['LIB'].split(os.pathsep)<br><br>    for libdir in libdirs:<br>      try:<br>        libcp = r'%s\libcp.lib' % libdir<br>        shutil.copy(libcp, Dir('#/.sconf_temp').abspath)<br>        if conf.TryLink(libcptest % (r'using %s' % libcp), '.cpp'):<br>          defenv.PrependENVPath('LIB', Dir('#/.sconf_temp').abspath)<br>          break<br>      except IOError:<br>        continue<br>    else:<br>      print "*** Couldn't find a good version of libcp.lib"<br>      Exit(2)</code>

      <p class="post-content">I should have made it clear that the case I was trying to fix was building with Vc8 not Vc9. So with Vc8 (MSVS 2005 / 8.0), you can build the special logging build without the single threaded C runtime. Vc9 is still broken as you mentioned. Vc9 stores the header files differently so the Scons folks will have to fix that problem.<br>
      <br>
      If you have installed Vc9 and have Vc8 on your machine, even if you set the environment variables to use MSVS 8.0 you will still have problems because Scons will go look in your registry and discover you have MSVS 9.0, try to use it and fail. You'll have to hack a Scons Python script to make it return MSVS 8.0 not 9.0. If you are interested in that hack, I can send you the file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">SCons releases a lot of new versions lately. Are you sure the latest 1.1.0 doesn't already support VC9? If it doesn't, the best method would be submitting a patch for scons\SCons\Tool\msvs.py. For NSIS, you can add a temporary tool and add it to the environment if it claims it found VC9.</p>

      <blockquote>
        I downloaded the NSIS sources (rev. 5767) from the subversion repository. An initial attempt to build with Visual Studio 2005 from "Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt" resulted in the same problem (Python 2.5, Scons v1.1.0.r3603):<br>
        <br>
        <pre>

</pre><br>
        <br>
        The generated config.log had the following content:<br>
        <br>
        <pre>
<code><br>        file C:\NSIS\SCons\Config\ms,line 37:<br>                Configure(confdir = .sconf_temp)<br>        .sconf_temp\conftest_0.cpp &lt;-<br>          |<br>          |#include &lt;fstream&gt;<br>          |int main() {<br>          |  // no change<br>          |  std::ofstream header("test", std::ofstream::out);<br>          |  return 0;<br>          |}<br>          |<br>        cl /Fo.sconf_temp\conftest_0.obj /c .sconf_temp\conftest_0.cpp /nologo /GS- /EHsc /TP /nologo /GS- /EHsc /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS /D_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_WARNINGS<br>        'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br>        operable program or batch file.<br></code>
</pre><br>
        <br>
        If I invoke the C compiler from the command prompt then the conftest_0.cpp file just builds fine.<br>
        <br>
        A comparison of the environment variables used in the command prompt and Scons revealed that Scons only takes the environment variables stored in the Windows registry.<br>
        <br>
        Quote: As a consequence the changes to the PATH, INCLUDE, LIB enviroment variables carried out by the "Visual Studio 2005 Prompt" batch script (vsvars32.bat) won't be propagated to Scons execution environment.<br>
        <br>
        The following patch propagates the current values of the<br>
        PATH, LIB, INCLUDE enviroment variables to the Scons<br>
        execution environment.<br>
        <br>
        <pre>
<code><br>--- NSIS.orig/SCons/Config/ms   Mon Nov 17 13:16:03 2008<br>+++ NSIS/SCons/Config/ms        Mon Nov 17 12:53:07 2008<br>@@ -2,6 +2,11 @@<br> <br> Import('defenv')<br>  <br>+import os<br>+defenv['ENV']['PATH'] = os.environ.get('PATH')<br>+defenv['ENV']['LIB'] = os.environ.get('LIB')<br>+defenv['ENV']['INCLUDE'] = os.environ.get('INCLUDE')<br>+<br> ### flags<br>     <br> defenv['ENTRY_FLAG'] = lambda x: '/entry:' + x<br></code>
</pre><br>
        <br>
        The above patch allows me to build NSIS with Visual Studio 2005.<br>
        <br>
        It might be a matter of personal preference whether to take the values of the environment variables from the current running command interpreter or the Windows registry. I would give precedence to the current running command interpreter.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Scons 1.2.0 does not fix the compilation issues with MSVS 2008 (VC9), unfortunately. However, there is a simple patch you can apply to msvc.py in your Python\Lib\site-packages\scons-1.2.0\Scons\Tool. The URL for the bug report and the patch is here: <a href="http://scons.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2224" target="_blank">http://scons.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2224</a><br>
      <br>
      One thing we probably should do with Vc9 is add:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>#include &lt;shellapi.h&gt;<br></code>
</pre><br>
      to Platform.h<br>
      <br>
      The reason for this is that in the newer SDKs, the FOF macros are now defined in shellapi.h instead of elsewhere. This causes MACRO redefinition warnings to appear since Platform.h defines them and then shellapi.h defines them again.

      <p class="post-content">shellapi.h added, thanks. But that SCons patch is, again, against SCons spirit and that's why it requires vsvars32.bat. Those paths are surely saved somewhere in the registry or in some XML file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, hopefully they will figure it out on their next release. They're approach still doesn't help you if you have multiple versions of MS Developer Studio installed on your machine. It always assumes that you will want to compile with the latest and that is not true -- for instance that fact that Scons doesn't support Vc9 makes you wish you can tell Scons to just use Vc8. So I think really the best way to get that intent across to Scons is either add a parameter to Scons to tell it which version of which compiler to use, or it reads the needed information through environment variables, assuming that the user knows what he's doing. This whole going into the registry to figure out what's installed and trying to glean the setup information just doesn't work when Microsoft just decides that some of that information will be in some new other mechanism. For every release of MSDEV, Scons will be behind.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure that it works.<br>
      <br>
      Every compiler I know takes cues from the environment and Microsoft's compiler is no exception. If your cmd.exe environment is setup for Vc9 and then you try to compile it for Vc8, is it guaranteed to work? Or would you have the potential for conflicting header files and libraries?<br>
      <br>
      It just seems to me that Scons' most fragile feature is the gleaning of the environment variables from the registry. Scons is so useful but I think it shoots itself in the foot when it tries to do something that it really ought not. Let the developer set up the usual environment for the compiler. Trust that he knows what he's doing. Have Scons worry about the project settings being correct for that compiler minus what's usually gotten from the environment. Then I would imagine that Scons won't break as often when a compiler vendor comes out with a new version. Each compiler vendor has to support a command line environment that works -- so make use of that environment.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, this is just my two cents.</p>

      <p class="post-content">But it does work :)<br>
      <br>
      It redefines the environment according to the selected version (defaulting to the highest) and ignores anything you define on your on in your cmd.exe. That's what Visual Studio does as well, so there's no reason it shouldn't work.<br>
      <br>
      As for letting the developer setup his environment, I'd rather not. We are not talking about Linux. Most developers I know and certainly most developers I've gotten questions from, don't know much about the environment. I love it that SCons sets it up for them. New versions are bound to come along but ignoring the old versions won't solve anything. An option is something else and still not a perfect solution as the flags might be all wrong.<br>
      <br>
      I will probably be creating a VC9 tool definition for scons soon for another project. If that happens, I'll submit it as a patch to scons after I add it to NSIS.</p>
