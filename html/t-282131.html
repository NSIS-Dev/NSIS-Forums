      <p class="post-content"><strong>Silent install with STDOUT output</strong><br />
      Is it possible to have silent install and have details to be output in STDOUT?<br />
      <br />
      I run installer during automated build. I run it with \S option. As part of installation I run some nsExecToLog commands. It prints output of my command in NSIS windows in GUI mode. But when I run in silent mode I have nothing. And I really need it to see how my installation worked.<br />
      <br />
      It would be nice to have silent mode but have Detailed log printed to STDOUT.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So if I understand correctly I need special build with scons NSIS_CONFIG_LOG=yes<br />
      then if I am in silent mode I call<br />
      LogSet on<br />
      So I will get installer.log file.<br />
      <br />
      But how can I print in STDOUT when I am in silent mode. Is it possible?<br />
      Or generate this file and then run second command to read this log file in stdout my only option?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I see. NSIS does not have ability to print into STDOUT.<br />
      <br />
      I think I will use SetLog option and then in my build automation just read install.log by next command, so I have something similar as stdout.<br />
      Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">As far as I know, and according to Google, you cannot have STDOUT if the application is not a console application.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can build NSIS with NSIS_CONFIG_LOG_STDOUT=yes. This will cause the log to be written to stdout. But nsExec doesn't go through the regular logging mechanism and directly updates the UI, so it won't appear there.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would like to send messages to STDOUT (or to the console) at the end of a silent install. I have read here that recompiling is the only way to accomplish this.<br />
      <br />
      I have recompiled with<br />
      scons NSIS_CONFIG_LOG=yes SKIPUTILS="NSIS Menu" NSIS_CONFIG_LOG_STDOUT=yes<br />
      <br />
      but my LogText messages are still being sent to install.log<br />
      <br />
      I am using the newly compiled makensis.exe [VC++ 9.0, sCons 0.98.5] with the Stubs from the special_build package.<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can't use the stubs from the special_build package. The stubs are the ones that have to be rebuilt according to your configuration. Use the ones you built and it should work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">doh, VC++ noobie here.<br />
      <br />
      I thought the stubs could be the issue but I could not find them in the build/release.<br />
      <br />
      Changing the build command to include a target gave me the stubs I was looking for.<br />
      scons <b>dist-zip</b><br />
      NSIS_CONFIG_LOG=yes SKIPUTILS="NSIS Menu" NSIS_CONFIG_LOG_STDOUT=yes<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>But the install.log does not generate</strong><br />
      After recompile the NSIS by<br />
      <br />
      scons NSIS_CONFIG_LOG=yes NSIS_CONFIG_LOG_STDOUT=yes<br />
      <br />
      I made the install detail output to the STDOUT, but I find that the install.log cannot be find.<br />
      <br />
      May I have both of them in silent install? Because my uninstall need the install.log.</p>
