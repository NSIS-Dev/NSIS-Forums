      <p class="post-content"><strong>2 Problems</strong><br />
      Hi All,<br />
      <br />
      I Am Sunil, and I am new to Null Soft installer. Previously I was working in MSI technology in Installshield.<br />
      <br />
      I have 2 problems :<br />
      <br />
      1. I want a to append a new string in English.nlf file<br />
      # ^Text1<br />
      "SomeTextHere"<br />
      <br />
      Now I tried using this string Text1:<br />
      WriteRegStr HKLM ".mov\shell\import" "Desc" "$(Text1)"<br />
      <br />
      But this doesnt work.<br />
      <br />
      As I want to use this $Text string in my script. Is it possible ? Basically I want that all strings, which I am adding in my installer script, should not be hard coded in script, they should be in some file (Like *.nlf file), so that it is easy to localise the application.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      2.<br />
      <br />
      Say I declare a variable :<br />
      Var Path<br />
      StrCpy $Path "C\\Program Files\\AAA\\BBB\\CCC\\DDD\\FFF"<br />
      <br />
      Now I pick files, which are located at the same base path :<br />
      <br />
      File ${Path}\\ppp.exe<br />
      File ${Path}\\GGG\\HHH\\uuu.exe<br />
      File ${Path}\\III\\JJJ\\KKK\\gggg.exe<br />
      <br />
      But this too doesnt work. $(Path) doesnt get resolved to exact path, it has. Why so ?<br />
      Basically here, I dont want to hard code Path. Whenever I want, I should be able to change the path with changing it only at one place.<br />
      <br />
      Please help,<br />
      <br />
      Sunil.</p>

      <p class="post-content">-1 No need to change the lang files, use LangString<br />
      -2 File is a compile time command, use a define (ex: !define Path "C\\Program Files\\AAA\\BBB\\CCC\\DDD\\FFF")</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks a lot Anders !! I understood the second answer. But I dint get the first one. You wrote that I should use LangString.<br />
      <br />
      For example :<br />
      <br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_ENGLISH} "English message"<br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_DUTCH} "Dutch message"<br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_FRENCH} "French message"<br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_GERMAN} "German message"<br />
      <br />
      Now the problem in this is that, while developing script, I dont know all languagee translations, so I will write some junk text in all locales, other than english.<br />
      <br />
      And when one has to localise the software, he has to look through script and has to find out, which strings should get localised.<br />
      <br />
      What I want that all strings, which are being added and should get localised, should be altogether in a file, and that file, we should be able to get localised. Localisation ppl, has only see that text file. And through script I should be able to pick up those translated strings.<br />
      <br />
      Can you please give me any example ?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks once again,<br />
      Sunil.</p>

      <p class="post-content">you could keep the translations in a seperate script (which you can distribute) and <i>!include</i> it to your main script. that's how i do it, have a look at <a href="http://download.berlios.de/xpy/lang_english-0.8.13.zip" target="_blank">this</a>.<br />
      <br />
      i'm not sure if you can use an external ini-file (readinistr) for your translations, you probably cant define a langstring on runtime.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want to include localized strings after compilation (during run time) things become more difficult.<br />
      <br />
      But if you just want to have a single "language file" which could be easely localized and compiled in your installer than you could export all language strings in an extra file, lets say "languages.nsh" which looks like:<br />
      <br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_ENGLISH} "English message"<br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_DUTCH} "Dutch message"<br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_FRENCH} "French message"<br />
      LangString Message ${LANG_GERMAN} "German message"<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then you easely include 'languages.nsh' in your installer script:<br />
      <br />
      !include "languages.nsh"<br />
      <br />
      You could give the languages.nsh to the translators and after it came back you include the new language and recompile the script.</p>
