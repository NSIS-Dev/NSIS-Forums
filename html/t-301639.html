      <p class="post-content"><strong>Problem Inserting HTML Link</strong><br />
      Okay, I read every single thread that has anything marginally related to inserting a html link, and I still cannot get one to show up. I want these on the usual Welcome Page and the Directory Page, NOT a custom page...I just want to use the macros that are there rather than write all the code from scratch as in the nsDialogs example...<br />
      <br />
      However, it's not working. I tried using<br />
      <br />
      !define MUI_WELCOMEPAGE_LINK "http://www.google.com"<br />
      !define MUI_WELCOMEPAGE_LINK_LOCATION "http://www.google.com"<br />
      <br />
      and nothing showed up. I also tried using the code from &lt;a href = "http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=263388&amp;highlight=url+link+welcome+page"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and couldn't get it to work either. Only when I change !include "MUI2.nsh" to !include "MUI.nsh" can I get it to show up, however, everything else in my installer is now messed up. Furthermore, I can't reposition the link anywhere.<br />
      <br />
      Also, since InstallOptions is outdated, none of the examples on the Wiki work. I'm out of options. Someone, please help? I've attached my code...where should I make the modifications?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The welcome page link patch only works with the old Modern UI and that's why you have to change to MUI.nsh to make it work. It relies on the usage of InstallOptions, yet MUI2 uses nsDialogs. That patch will have to be rewritten to work or you could do it yourself by adding a link in the show callback function. Simply call ${NSD_CreateLink} there.<br />
      <br />
      To add a link to the directory, I suggest the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Linker_plug-in" target="_blank">Linker plug-in</a>. You'd probably need to add a static label using Resource Hacker to your UI and set it using !define MUI_UI.</p>
