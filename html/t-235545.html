Waiting for all files in dir A to complete before moving to dir B would be fine (could be some time w/only one processor working).<br><br>If you have a couple hundered MB of data this is just a nicety... but if you have a few GB of data this would be extremely helpful! We're well over the 2GB limit in raw data, but with lzma and non-solid compression we get to ~1.6GB on the install size. On a 3Ghz SMP machine my project takes ~6 hours to compress it's data. Not great when you are trying for quick turnaround on uploading your next beta submission :(</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th January 2006 14:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">It's not currently possible to create a new thread with the current code.

Also, with solid compression you can't compress one file at a time, you must compress the entire block.<br><br>It's not that this is not a desired feature, it's just that it's not that simple.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
