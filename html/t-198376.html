Or, is using a signed cab more problematic than using a straight .exe file where you get the 'malicous code' warnings and where the user is prompted for a location to download the .exe. Is there some accepted protocol for real world installers ?<br><br>many thanks as I hope this is not too theoretical</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">scully13</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th November 2004 13:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I would say a straight executable would be better than a signed cab. However, you could take it one step further and sign your executable. Ecspecially, since I'm sure you'll have users running XP with SP2.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">grahama</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th November 2004 21:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">a growing few...still find a lot of users with 2000 and 98 :( Hell, I use Mac OS X with Virtual PC....as I do not actually own a PC computer.

The only difference I notice is with SP2 you get a warning when it's not signed. The only signing technique I'm familiar with is Verisign and we use it to sign both CABs and EXEs using signcode.exe. If the CAB isn't signed some users won't be allowed to install it at all depending on how their security settings are set in IE. If your looking for others besides Verisign I've seen them talked about in this forum but I'm unfamiliar with them or what the difference is.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">grahama</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th November 2004 23:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">great ....seems like Verisign would be the way to go for this kind of thing<br>many thanks</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
