      <p class="post-content"><strong>CopyFiles is slow, one file per second</strong><br />
      CopyFiles copies any file I have slowly, about one file every 1.1 seconds. I tried different types of examples with CopyFiles and different scripts. To duplicate the problem, try the example below and let me know what's up. Remember it creates a few temporary files in the current folder. Thanks.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You have no problem ?<br />
      <br />
      I also have a P4-3GHz machine and NSIS 2.15. Using 'File','Delete','RMDir' command is instantaneous for me, but not 'CopyFiles'. (I just realized you were being sarcastic .. :))<br />
      <br />
      Time to reinstall nsis or windows if it is just my system ...<br />
      <br />
      Now what worries me is that what if I gave the installation to other people and they run into this problem too. They can not be expected to reinstall windows ... ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Without it, do you have a way to make a backup of files before you extract your package?. Without it, do you have a way to be able to setup installation to copy files from CD instead of extracting? Would be nice to know an alternative.<br />
      <br />
      BTW, nothing is in the background. I am not sure how else to say that only that command is slow. Using 'File' to extract 10 megabytes of files takes a few seconds. Using 'CopyFiles' would take the same process 24 minutes (1440 files). I tried deleting files before copying. I tried other drives, harddisks, network drive, usb drive.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OMG. It works. I would never have known that by looking at the tutorial in section 4.9.3.2. The description is completely different. Thanks Instructor.<br />
      <br />
      Do I need error checking? The tutorial says error checking is turned off when using silent?<br />
      <br />
      P.S. Sorry the code above saves files in 'C:\Program Files\NSIS\'. I thought it was going to the current folder and forgot to use $OUTDIR and $EXEDIR.<br /></p>

      I have problem with copying (and deleting, moving, reading also) NSIS installers. It is very slow (about 300 kB/s) on my decent machine. I am using LZMA compression and my installer has about 9 MBs. By the way, compress ratio is very good (under 25%), I think that it is because I have packed 3 very similar and large binaries.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Joel, If I have 9 MBs NSIS .exe and 9MBs zip file and try to copy them, then both copies takes same time. BUT after copying the .exe is copy progressbar on 100% for approximately 3-4 seconds. It disappears immediately when I am copying the .zip or other file. I don't understand this. I think, that it has nothing to do with security programs (I am using NOD 32 on my "NSIS" machine).</p>

      </blockquote>I have a project of 100 MB of the nsis .exe.<br />
      Inside I have a 25~ MB of 7zip, 10~MB of zip, plus files inside, and some files are in $EXEDIR of my CD-ROM.<br />
      The only problem, if that is a problem, is when nsis dump all to $PLUGINSDIR...but decompressing the single files aren't for me one per sec, even I use nod32 3.x beta...<br />
      Normally nod32 scans in each file compress, so maybe id your memory, processor...don't know...I've using nsis since 1.98 as far I remember, and trust me...hog isn't part of its specs.

      <p class="post-content">I think that you don't understand me. If I say COPYING, DELETING, MOVING, then I mean operations done by my OS, not by NSIS. I compared copying 9MBs NSIS .exe and 9MBs .zip FROM ONE FOLDER TO ANOTHER in my previous post.<br />
      I know that it was confusing to post this here to this thread, but I didn't want to start a new one. Maybe I had to...<br />
      So, I am just curious why system waits ~4 seconds after copying NSIS .exe file and doesn't wait after copying another one. If I close NOD32 it happens too.</p>
