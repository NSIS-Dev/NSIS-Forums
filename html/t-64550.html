That's also the reason the last project I converted from InstallShield to NSIS went from a 5.8 MB file where you had to reboot at least once, older versions of Windows twice, down to a 1.7 MB file with no reboot typically required.

Where else can you get feedback to the developer and you can create your own. Now, I think back to a post for a multiplatform NSIS. Why couldn't you guys create a C++ based NSIS scripting core. That way, whenever the downloader updates his/her version of NSIS, then all the program could do is read the C++ source and use that core in conjuntion with a NSIS DLL. But the downloader needs to install the source to use the full core. That way, when a new version is solidified, then you can do a full update.<br><br>Just an idea though.<br>-Duane</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Koen van de Sande</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd November 2001 08:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Creating 'the' NSIS gui is hard, because there are 2 different GUI's required:<br>1) The scripting GUI.

Is it going to be completely wizard/gui based with no ability to script or a mixture of the two. The latter being a much more complex proposition mainly due to the fact that NSIS scripting language isn't "structured" e.g. variable number of arguments, lines can span multi lines, lines can include code and comments, which therefore makes it difficult to parse with total success. Something like Ghost score well in that department as the script definition if stored in XML making it easy to parse (although apart from that it doesn't look very impressive).<br><br>You need to decide what language it's going to be written in, that might be down to which language the majority of the volunteers can code in. Also agree coding standards that everyone must stick to, it's no fun reading through code written in n different styles. I suppose at that time agree what sort of licensing it is going to have, freeware, open source...<br><br>When you've got the easy bits out of the way you need to work out how you're going to break the project up in order for multiple people to work on it. It's not enough just to think that you can simply share out the different screens, as in order to be able to do that everyone needs to know how they will hook together, file layouts, internal data structures... Project managing a team of programmers isn't easy even if each is working on a different program within a suite of programs, I know I do it, it's quite a few times more difficult when they're all working on the same program, even more so when working remotely.<br><br>So that's you taken care of for next week!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Koen van de Sande</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd November 2001 20:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Teamwork is hard.

Maybe we should just start designing a few of these pages in VB or Delphi? I'd like to use VirtualTreeView for the Section/File pages, because of it's flexibility.<br><br>Back to XML: The Delphi 6 TXMLDocument can parse XML files (read anyway).

When coding you have to start differently. It's just that our views on the interface are very different (I think).<br>The treeview on the left is nice, I have it myself in TibEd. Then on the right, like you have your grid, you have all the options. Doing it inside a seperate form isn't very handy - you have to click, close, etc. It's much handier when it 'seamlesly' integrates. Perhaps that was the whole idea of Frames in Delphi? Mmm perhaps Frames might be the way to go. Everyone gets their own frame (every page/item in the tree).<br>But we have to make some sort of TNSISProject base class first, with child members, etc. Perhaps I should make the VPatch GUI opensource, it has something similar.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mkeeley</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th November 2001 20:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Frames don't work in the way you may be thinking. Nothing to do with multi-pages, they're a container, bit like a super panel, that you add you're controls to, the frame can then be used a bit like a composite component. But if you're thinking do that and then, say, add them to the pages of a notebook then you'll have problems linking them up to the toolbar and menu.<br><br>Having a dialog requires no more typing from the end user than if the form was "integrated", for example either way when you're adding a file you'll still want OK and Cancel options.<br><br>One program I've written in the past uses multiple forms shown in a form container. So my main form has the section side panel on the left and the frame container on the right in which you you create an instance of the forms in.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">trace</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th November 2001 21:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">oh delphi is nothing for me so i`ll be just the listener for this round. however if trying to explain how the interface shall be, make some picture of it. it`ll be more understable for all of us (i think) more people can write their feelings from it... bye ;) (sorry my english)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">liquidmotion</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th November 2001 00:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">kinda sounds like the old slate blue: all on one form, seamlessly integrated.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mkeeley</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th November 2001 01:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Never saw the old version of Slate Blue, but the main differnece is probably that it's completley gui/wizard based, you never normally see the script.
