I made a simple installer for this program I have. Mostly it just copies support files (dlls) to directories &amp; makes shortcuts since the actual program is on the network. Installing to a Windows NT machine causes no problems but when I install to a Windows 2000 machine two files don't seem to get registered - msjet35.dll and dao350.dll. No error message is generated during install but when the program is launched it gives error messages meaning it couldn't find the correct version (or any version) of those two files. Going to a command prompt and doing "regsvr32 blah blah" works because the files get copied. It just doesn't seem to register them.<br><br>I'm using the UpgradeDLL macro and a sample call goes like this:<br><br>SetOutPath $SYSDIR<br>ClearErrors<br>Push "$SYSDIR\msjet35.dll"<br>!define DLL_NAME msjet35.dll<br>!insertmacro UpgradeDLL<br><br>I apologize if something like this was posted and if it was, please direct me to where. Otherwise, I'd really like some help on this.<br><br>Thanks</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th August 2002 11:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">If both NSIS and regsvr32.exe can't register this DLL than it can't be a problem with NSIS. I would recommend seraching MSDN, Microsoft support, and of course Google.

I sure don't :(<br><br>I hope you can find something in those other places...
