I prefer PDF files to CHM files as I find the CHM format too inflexible and not at all easy to print out. I hope that whatever documentation scheme is adopted will continue to provide HTML files as an alternative, even if they are only available via CVS.<br><br>My understanding is that the new documentation scheme requirements are for a system that takes a simple text file with very little in the way of formatting commands and produces a searchable document, hopefully suitable for printing a hard copy.<br><br>As I am too lazy to even think about writing such a program, I looked around to see if there were any free programs that could help meet these requirements. I've found two free programs that seem quite promising: one (Scheme Scribe) creates HTML files and the other (HTMLDOC) converts HTML files into PDF files.<br><br>I've created a small demo using some pages from the NSIS User Manual and found that it took very little effort to get a searchable PDF file suitable for printing. I am still learning how to use these programs so my demo cannot claim to be anything other than a poor example of what these programs can do. If anyone is interested in seeing what can be achieved by someone who doesn't really know how to use these programs, the HTML and PDF versions of my demo and a few source files are in the scribedemo.zip attachment.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th April 2003 11:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Your PDF isn't really different from one big HTML file, you can search both in the same way.<br><br>The CHM documentation we are working on will have a TOC, an index (an easy list of all commands), etc.<br><br>A CHM (HTML Help) file is just a package of HTML files and TOC/index files, so the HTML files will still be available.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th April 2003 11:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I quite like the final result but I can't comment on it's usability from the perspective of the doc maintainers since I'm not one :)Cheers for the input.<br><br>-- Sunjammer</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th April 2003 14:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yeah PDF is indeed useful for printing :) So both a PDF and a CHM file would be great :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th April 2003 16:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>I hope that whatever documentation scheme is adopted will continue to provide HTML files as an alternative, even if they are only available via CVS.</blockquote>The ideal state would be one program, or at least one batch file, that generates HTML, PDF, and CHM.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pengyou</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st April 2003 01:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">HTMLDOC does not make many demands upon the format of the HTML files it processes.
