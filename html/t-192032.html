Doubt it...</strong><br>I was scanning my computer recently with Kaspersky using the extended databases : Pronware, spyware, and malware.<br><br>It scanned thru NSIS20.exe and came up with Not-A-Virus:Totalvelocity.o. I was puzzled until it then scanned thru the latest snapshot development zip and scanned NSISUPDATE.exe and found the same file. I was curious, is this my scanner confusing things? I looked up totalvelocity on symantec and it said it was a annonymous data sender to totalvelocity.com so that couldn't be it.<br><br>I'm assuming this is either a mistake made by Kaspersky and it noticed similar code. Or spyware resides in NSIS? I'm highly doubting theres spyware so I thought I would ask your professional opinion on what this is.<br><br>This exe was from the sourceforge site. Seems as if that detection came from nsis updater.<br><br>I never ever goto any suspicious sites so I know the exe wasn't "Infected" by anything. I love your installer system alot and it kind of bothered me to see that odd detection in your software. I know this has to be a simple mistake. Keep up the good work on NSIS.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>-=HaXoMaTiC=-</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st August 2004 20:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">False positive.

All are false positives. There is also an old one with McAfee and NSISUpdate.exe. That one can be found in the bug tracker I think.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">31st August 2004 21:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Indeed, you're right. Just another screwup at Kaspersky. Falsely detecting my favorite program in the world. ^_^. If only programming languages were this easy... but i love challenges. mwhahahahah.<br><br>Well thanks for the fast replys and keep up the good work on NSIS. Its a work of art. I would get ahold of Kaspersky.com and let them know about their mistake. Could scare off people people from learning this godly installer system.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">deguix</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">1st September 2004 00:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Norton, McAfee, Sophos, BitDefender, Kaspersky...
