      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I've just tried using "InstallColors" on NSIS 1.42 (even inverting the colors and using /windows) and have seen no visible effect....</p>

      <p class="post-content">hi,<br />
      <br />
      dunno where your problem is .. for me it works fine.<br />
      <br />
      e.g.:<br />
      InstallColors 993300 FFFF00<br />
      or<br />
      InstallColors /WINDOWS<br />
      <br />
      cu yzo<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">Not exactly a helpful answer, as I said I inverted the colors and this had no effect so WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO EFFECT? It may have an effect somewhere I just want to know where. In case it matters I'm using Windows 2000 SP1. You of course didn't mention your operating system....<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">hi,<br />
      <br />
      sorry but what are you talking about?<br />
      the command InstallColors defines the colors of the listbox<br />
      which shows the details after installing.<br />
      <br />
      if you inverted the colors the listbox should have had the lime color and the text should have been black<br />
      <br />
      if you chose /WINDOWS the listbox should have behaved like your windows settings. in my case it is white with black font.<br />
      <br />
      if you set ShowInstDetails to nevershow the InstallColors command has no effect, as the details are not shown.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, after your previous response I tried again. This time I displayed the listbox and saw the colors.<br />
      <br />
      The documentation does not say what the colors are for and I think it would be reasonable for them to affect the installer colors and not just a list box which may or may not be displayed... For what the command does "ListBoxColors" would have been more appropriate.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway I'm picked a better color, I know what it does and now I'm happy :-)<br />
      <br />
      Of course if I real "InstallColors" comes along I'll try it out also.<br />
      <br />
      I could make one small point here, I think that rather than have new commands for all of these types of things (particularly commands whose placement is restricted, I think it would be better to have variables such as perhaps<br />
      "$ListBoxBg" and "$ListBoxFg" etc.</p>
