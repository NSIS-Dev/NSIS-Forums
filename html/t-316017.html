Are you sure you searched before you asked?<br><br>Here's what I do:<br>- During install, save version number to registry<br>- Before installing again, read registry and compare previous version number with current one. (Use the versioncompare macro in WordFunc.nsh.) If newer, go into update mode.<br><br>Everything is possible with NSIS, but nothing is automatic. You'll have to code your updating functionality yourself.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dm82m</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th January 2010 09:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hey MSG,<br><br>thanks for your reply. I solved my problem as you have written. If the installer detects a already installed older version it asks for uninstalling and deletes this version.<br><br>Now my product has several components (client, server, ...). Lets say I run my installer 1.0.0 the first time and install the client.<br>Then I start the same installer again, it detects that 1.0.0 is already installed. How is it possible to lets say go into a update mode. this means that it will show what was recently installed (in this case the client).<br>Now if i deselect the Client and select the Server the installer should remove the client and install the Server.<br>Can you give me some hints how this could be done?<br><br>Regards,<br>Dirk</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MSG</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th January 2010 08:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>Then I start the same installer again, it detects that 1.0.0 is already installed. How is it possible to lets say go into a update mode. this means that it will show what was recently installed (in this case the client).</blockquote>Sections.nsh has two macros called SelectSection and UnselectSection, you can use these to change the default component selection. You can try to autodetect the installed components (with ${If} ${FileExists} for example), or save the selected components to registry and read them in .onInit.<br><br><blockquote>Now if i deselect the Client and select the Server the installer should remove the client and install the Server.<br>Can you give me some hints how this could be done?</blockquote>Create an invisible section (Section "-HiddenSection") and use ${If} / ${IfNot} ${SectionIsSelected}.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">scanreg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th January 2010 14:13 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">1.
