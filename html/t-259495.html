What I did was pop up another message box telling the user to wait till the installation has finished on the Device before continuing. Not full proof, but at least it is one more thing for them to clcik before they continue. You could also put a sleep in to delay the pop up.<br><br>One thing just came to mind though, what if we have a text file in one on the cab files. In the NSIS install package have a loop that searchs for that text file. When it finds that file, then continue? Might work.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">zbd</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th November 2006 21:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">that loop idea is a good one, but i'm not too sure. Can we search for a 'file' on a Mobile device?<br><br>but the other issue is, the installation may have finished on the device, but on some devices, the user still has to click 'ok' when the message saying the 'installation has completed successfully' pops up.<br>So if we used the text file, actually i tried to do a similar thing with a reg key (so it checks for the reg key once it has been installed) and it works, but the problem is, it wont install the next cab if that 'successful install' notification window hasn't been clicked. so the check doesn't make a difference, i have a feeling its not possible, i've just put the messageboxes with MB_EXCLAIMATION to try and draw some extra attention so they dont just skip it.<br>It shouldn't matter too much, if they just run the installer again it will install the components that failed to install last time.<br><br>- Cheers for your help</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
