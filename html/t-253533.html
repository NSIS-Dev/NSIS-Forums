But, a few things you might look at:<br>- Does the user have the ability to write to the desktop?<br>- Does the file "IWARN.BAT" exist in $INSTDIR? (you might want to place a messagebox just before the file copy as a troubleshooting step to make sure $INSTDIR and $DESKTOP are set to where you think they should be.)<br><br>And what is the purpose of having ${FileCopy}? It doesn't seem to be used in your example.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Potz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th August 2006 16:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I know I have been moving things around with $INSTDIR and $DESKTOP so that shouldn't be a problem. I know the file exists and it is writable to desktop.<br><br>what I am trying to do is move a shortcut from the $INSTDIR and put it on the desktop.

I guess when I had the files unzip there were other folders made and I didn't realize it. Thanks for your help. you are right about not having to specify a destination file name.
