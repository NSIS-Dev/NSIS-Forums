      <p class="post-content"><strong>System::Call dll is not working</strong><br />
      &nbsp; I wrote a DLL file. And I want to call during some installation process.<br />
      <br />
      But it doesn't work. I searched and read some article about that, but I couldn't get it work.<br />
      <br />
      I made my DLL file by Visual Studio 6. There are 1 public class and 1 function. A class has 1 public methods and 1 private method.<br />
      <br />
      this is my nsi file.<br />
      <br />
      Name "dllTest2"<br />
      OutFile "dllTest2.exe"<br />
      ShowInstDetails show<br />
      <br />
      Section<br />
      SetPluginUnload alwaysoff<br />
      SetOutPath "$TEMP\ttt"<br />
      File MyDll.dll<br />
      System::Call "MyDll::ttt()i .r8"<br />
      System::Call 'MyDll::test(i "1", i "2") i .r1'<br />
      DetailPrint "After Calling: $1"<br />
      DetailPrint "After Calling: $8"<br />
      SetPluginUnload manual<br />
      SectionEnd<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      nsi file and dll file are placed in same folder.<br />
      <br />
      The compile is ok, but the message is always "error".<br />
      <br />
      After run the exe file, mydll.dll is in $TEMP\ttt folder. but I think dll call is not happened.<br />
      <br />
      I need your help. How do I call mydll? Should I do anything else to call dll function?</p>

      </blockquote>I fixed my nsi file as you've suggested and some line added like this.<br />
      <br />
      DetailPrint "After Calling: $PLUGINSDIR"<br />
      <br />
      $PLUGINSDIR is changed when I execute exe file. But when I go that folder, there is not my dll file. There's System.dll file only. What's wrong? I have no idea.<br />
      <br />
      What should I do?

      </blockquote>I fixed the code, but it didn't work. I wonder it works though there's no path to my dll file. Does "!addplugindir" make it possible? Anyway, there's no files where the outPath that I specified. However when I add a line "File mydll.dll" there is my dll.<br />
      <br />
      I have a question. Is it possible that my dll file is not correct? It was just made by app. wizard of VS 6.0. But I tested it by calling from console program.<br />
      <br />
      I downloaded the tutorial and read some articles, but I can't make my app. work as I wished.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway I really appreciate your suggestion.

      </blockquote>Can we see your compiled DLL? Something is not right.<br />
      !addplugindir will scan the given directory for plugins, so you can call them as you want.

      <p class="post-content">You could just convert your plugin into an NSIS plugin and call it like that. You wouldn't need to use the System plugin then and if you're not using it elsewhere in your script you'll save some space (not that it matters too much anyway).<br />
      <br />
      Theres a plugin example called ExDll included with the latest NSIS bundle (or source code bundle).<br />

extern "C" void test(...)

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I found somthing's wrong, but I can't find the solution</strong><br />
      &nbsp; When I compile my nsi file, the log message is quite different from what other usual dll file is included.<br />
      <br />
      This is right log.<br />
      - System::Alloc<br />
      - System::Call<br />
      - System::Copy<br />
      - System::Free<br />
      - System::Get<br />
      - System::Int64Op<br />
      - System::Store<br />
      <br />
      And this is unrecognizing message-when mydll is included.<br />
      - MyDll::??0CMyDll@@QAE@XZ<br />
      - MyDll::??4CMyDll@@QAEAAV0@ABV0@@Z<br />
      - MyDll::?nMyDll@@3HA<br />
      - MyDll::?test@CMyDll@@QAEHHH@Z<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      well....I'll try to find the solution. However if you give me some advice or the answer, I'll really appreciate your help. :)</p>

      <br />
      I really thank your help!<br />
      <br />
      By the way I have 1 more question. Can't I use class methods? If I add 'extern "C"' in front of member method, log message is still understandable.<br />
