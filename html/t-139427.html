There will be some CVS access issues as a result as stated in the following quote. The <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip" target="_blank">developement snapshot</a> is updated about 3 times a day and isn't affected by the hardware move, hence it doesn't have a 24 hour lag.<br><br></p><blockquote>( 2003-06-13 08:17:23 - Project CVS Services ) The SourceForge.net team is aware of the continued performance issues afflicting project CVS services. While a portion of the work needed to alleviate these issues has been completed, we are currently waiting for the implementation of new hardware to complete this work; this is expected to occur in the month of August. In the mean time, the following steps will be taken by SourceForge.net staff: developer (SSH) CVS access will not be changed; pserver-based CVS access from the project shell servers (i.e. from cron jobs) will not be changed, but the overall cap of pserver connections from the shell will be lowered to a more reasonable level; pserver-based CVS access from external hosts (i.e. not the project shell server) will be served against the backup CVS server, which contains data roughly 24 hours older than that on the primary CVS server; ViewCVS access will be provided using the backup CVS server (data shown by ViewCVS may be older than the current data in the repository). These changes will be transparent to users and will not require any configuration changes on your part. These measures are temporary and will be removed pending the successful completion of our work to improve performance on the primary CVS server. It is our expectation that offloading ViewCVS services and pserver-based CVS access to the backup CVS server will bring developer CVS performance back to a reasonable level. Should you have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please contact the SourceForge.net team by submitting a Support Request.</blockquote></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2003 12:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">CVS is coming back to normal next week (hopefully)!<br><br></p><blockquote>(<b>2003-09-19 05:50:42</b>) Note From Patrick McGovern, Director SourceForge.net<br><br>As you may have noticed, CVS is visibly having growing pains. Due to system load, we have had to move anonymous checkouts to our backup server. This has made the code of our 70,000 projects more accessible to project developers. I know this temporary solution has frustrated some of you and I want to apologize for that.<br><br>This is what we are doing about it: We have 6 new systems that have been installed in our co-location facility. These are very fast Xeon systems, with very fast RAID. These systems will improve performance by a tremendous amount. (As a comparison, our current setup has two systems, one primary and one backup, that are three years old with slow processors and aging disk arrays).<br><br>In a previous sitewide email we proclaimed that the faster hardware would be online last month (August). This was the goal but we had some unexpected delays. These delays included late hardware delivery, additional electrical requirements in our colo cage, and a host of other issues. That's the bad news. The good news is we are very close to having this fixed.<br><br>As of right now, we are working around the clock to get these new boxes online to give relief to the performance issues. Our primary CVS server is copying 15 million files to these six new machines. Since this box is also serving CVS checkins and checkouts to the community simultaneously, the data transfer has been slow going. During the last 4 days we have transfered 40% of the data. <b>We expect the rest of the data to be transfered by Thursday of next week, and the new boxes online shortly there after.</b> Hang in there, we will have this behind us in the very near term.<br><br>If you have questions or comments about this, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:pat@sourceforge.net">pat@sourceforge.net</a></blockquote></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Konrad</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 15:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>CVS Server</strong><br>Are the new CVS servers already in the system now, or is there still a delay of 24 hours because of a backup system?<br>I think it can't take such a long time to replace the servers.<br>Thank you for any new information regarding that issue.<br><br>Konrad</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 16:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">No news from SourceForge yet.
