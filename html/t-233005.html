      <p class="post-content"><strong>zombie userid l_d_allan?</strong><br />
      &lt;alert comment="web challenged"&gt;<br />
      <br />
      I've gotten a new computer, and want to be able to participate in the nsis forum on the new computer. Both computers are part of a SOHO workgroup with WinXp-Sp2.<br />
      <br />
      I can't seem to be able to logout from the old computer and be able to login from the new computer. I've attempted to logout from the old computer, remove cookies, etc.<br />
      <br />
      I'm able to login as l_d_allan on the new computer, but when I try to post a new message, I am identified as "unregistered user"<br />
      <br />
      When I logout from the old computer, the forum usually shows that l_d_allan is still logged in.<br />
      <br />
      I've rebooted from both computers, and tried a number of permutations .... but I'm stumped. Am I doing something wrong? Is this the way vBulletin works?<br />
      <br />
      My userid is l_d_allan .... I writing this from the old computer .... attempting to send a new topic is rejected from the new computer.<br />
      <br />
      &lt;/alert&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just log in from both machines. the forums dont track sessions in that manor.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's what I've been unable to do .... on the new computer, there is a message "Welcome back Lynn" and I can view my profile, but I cannot initiate or reply to a topic. I was even able to go in and revise the password on the new computer, but I seem to be locked out of the forums.<br />
      <br />
      I'm writing this on the old computer .... when I try to reply on the new computer, the forum software identifies me as an unregistered user .... even after I was able to login?????<br />
      <br />
      This happens if if I am logged in on the old computer, or after I've logged off the old computer.<br />
      <br />
      Not a biggie .... just a nuisance ... I can create another user i.d. ..... it isn't like I'm all that prolific a contributor ....</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well that seemed to be the problem. I've got the computer set to "challenge" a cookie being delivered from a webpage. Most websites that use cookies cause this challenge to appear, but that doesn't seem to be the case for nsis forums.<br />
      <br />
      I put this security setting back to "automatic" and I seem to be able to initiate topic threads, and reply to existing ones.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your help and patience.</p>
