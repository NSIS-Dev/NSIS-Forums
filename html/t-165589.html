      <p class="post-content"><strong>Sysinfo and Win2000 fails</strong><br />
      Please help if you can, For me SunJammers SysInfo dll does not work on windows 2000.<br />
      <br />
      i have compiled the test that comes with the dll, and every single call fails. the error roughly reads "cannont load c:\test\sysinfo.dll"<br />
      <br />
      the output i get instead of the expected numbers is the the name of the 'attribute' i was looking for. eg for<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />!insertmacro GetSysVer 'MajorVersion'<br />StrCpy $VerOSMajor $9<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      The variable $VerOSMajor will end up containg the string "MajorVersion"<br />
      <br />
      it works fine on my work machine, winXP, but i just formatted and setup a Win2k Sp3 machine and it fails on that.<br />
      <br />
      i can only assume it's the line, from the example with the dll, containing CallInstDLL in<br />
      <pre>
<code><br />!macro GetSysVer VALUE<br />        Push ${VALUE}<br />        CallInstDLL "$R0" GetSystemVersionValue<br />        Pop $9<br />        DetailPrint 'GetSystemVersionValue: ${VALUE}: $9'<br />!macroend<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      that is failing, since i see nowhere else for the error to occur.<br />
      <br />
      i've tried hardcoding a location for the dll, and researched the archives for anything relating to 'sysinfo' or 'CallInstDLL' but with no solution.<br />
      <br />
      help :)

      <p class="post-content">For normal plug-ins that extend your installer, use the plug-in command plugin::function.<br />
      <br />
      Example:<br />
      <br />
      SystemInfo::GetSystemVersionValue<br />
      <br />
      You also don't have to use a plug-in to get the Windows version, you can also use the GetWindowsVersions function (see the Users Manual).<br />
      <br />
      <font size="1">CallInstDLL is intented to call a DLL file that already exists on the system. To use it, you will have to include the file, extract it to a temporary location and delete it afterwards. Of course you can't use a run-time variable with the location of the DLL on your system, it should be on the users system.</font></p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks, i was looking doing that but i wasn't sure how to go about it. but i've changed the code, now i know it can be done.<br />
      <br />
      problem : the code works fine on my machine ( xp ), but it still fails on win2000. i no longer get any message about the dll failing to load, i guess becuase that is now left up to NSIS. but the output from the functions is still the same ( as above ).<br />
      <br />
      Help :)<br />
      <br />
      Note : the change i did is simple, but i can post an attachment of the entire test .nsi if need be.<br />
      <br />
      the function above changed to<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />!macro GetSysVer VALUE<br />    SysInfo::GetSystemVersionValue ${VALUE}<br />    Pop $9<br />    DetailPrint 'GetSystemVersionValue: ${VALUE}: $9'<br />!macroend<br /></code>

      <p class="post-content">yes, it worked to a greater degree but not perfectly, but i think that was down to me being a noob. my code, using GetWindowsVersion, _had_ detected that it was 200x. i had code that tested for "00" and "03", but wasn't working right. it was as i was about to debug it that i found SysInfo.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i've now successfully used GetWindowsVersion and the line<br />
      [code]<br />
      ReadRegStr $R6 HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows Nt\CurrentVersion" CSDVersion<br />
      [\code]<br />
      to get the version and service pack of windows.<br />
      <br />
      so _my_ problem of being able to get those things is gone, but the issue still stands.</p>
