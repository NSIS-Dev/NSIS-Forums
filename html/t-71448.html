Trying to compress mp3's (already compressed sound) won't work to well. Taking non-compressed files (pictures and web pages) will work fine. So in short words, your test sucks.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">justin</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2002 23:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">7zip uses a ton of different compressors from what I can see... and it is GPLd.. so not very compatible with NSIS..<br><br>-Justin</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">DuaneJeffers</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th January 2002 07:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Re: can nsis use A good compress method 7-zip</strong><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by hotice</i><br><b>BZip2 BWT algorithm.</b></blockquote>Well if it emulates BZip2 it would be nice to see if it is good.
