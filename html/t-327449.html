I have no problems with the renaming if I launch a command line manually. If I use the Rename command in NSIS I have no success. So I tried using either "Exec" "ExecWait" or "nsExec::Exec" in order to run the command 'ren' (eg nsExec::Exec '"ren" file file.old'). Again nothing happens.<br><br>Therefore I ran the following<br><br>ReadEnvStr $R0 COMSPEC<br>Exec '"$R0" start cmd.exe'<br><br>so that I could interact with the command prompt spawned by the installer. If I search for the dll in the System32 directory, it can't find it even though in Windows Explorer it is clearly there. Doing a directory list in the command prompt doesn't show the dll in the list. This gives the impression that the command prompt being launched from the installer is not launching as a normal command prompt does if launched manually.<br><br>For the heck of it I tried running 'setshellvarcontext' to 'current' (which is admin in my case) with no success. Are there any ideas as to why I can't rename the dll from the installer but have no problems when launching a command prompt normally? They should behave the same right? Thanks in advance for any input.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Anders</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th February 2011 21:08 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Exec* runs child process in the same context as the installer.<br><br>Are you on x64?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">blh83</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th February 2011 22:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Oh I see what you are saying.
