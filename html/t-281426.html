      <p class="post-content"><strong>Installer in Simplified Chinese</strong><br />
      This may be a naive question as I do not have a great deal of experience with NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      I am trying to build an installer in Simplified Chinese. I can do this and the Chinese displays correctly in the installer dialogue, when run on Chinese Windows, except for one place which is the initial language selection combo. If I put German in, it say Deutsch, French is shown as Francais etc. but Simplified Chinese is shown as Chinese(Simplified), i.e. in English, and it is not shown in Chinese script.<br />
      <br />
      I have tried compiling in English Windows and Chinese Windows all to no avail.<br />
      <br />
      When compiling, I get a warning which refers to:<br />
      <br />
      LangString "DESC_SecInstall" is not set in language table of language SimpChinese<br />
      <br />
      but I can no reference to this.<br />
      <br />
      I am using the modern UI and pretty much copying the multilingual example.<br />
      <br />
      I would appreciate anyone's help. Thanx</p>

      <p class="post-content">That happens because the standard of using the English name for the language selection is not enforced in the language files.<br />
      <br />
      The LangString warning is generated because you haven't defined a Chinese text for the DESC_SecInstall LangString.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for your reply.<br />
      <br />
      So - are you saying that with Simplified Chinese, the standard of using English is applied. If so, do you know how to stop that happening so I can display a Chinese string?<br />
      <br />
      Secondly, I have no idea where to define DESC_SecInstall. Is this the string that is the Chinese text for Simplified Chinese? The inclusion of German gives a similar error message, so I suspect that this is not particularly relevant.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Those strings come from the language file. Edit Contrib\Language files\SimpChinese.nsh. You can also hack it a bit by redefining LANGFILE_SIMPCHINESE_NAME to the string you want.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks again for the reply and for your help.<br />
      <br />
      I have resolved the problem now, by editing the .nsh file. Has to be done on a Chinese Windows system though - could not get it accepted on a language-packed English system.</p>

      <p class="post-content">John, I had the same problem but if you don't care about Windows 9x, then you can use the Unicode version of NSIS. Check out www.scratchpaper.com for the binaries and source. You can also look at the "Unicode" thread in this forum for more information.</p>
