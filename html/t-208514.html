      <p class="post-content">1. Now have:<br></p>

      <blockquote>
        Error: Can't add entry, no section or function is open!<br>
        Error in script "C:\Documents and Settings\AMD 64 3400\Pulpit\ins\Wtyczki\wtykpak.nsi" on line 45 -- aborting creation process
      </blockquote>2. Ok, but I would ask other somebody it :).<br>
      3. Sound does not act in this example:<br>

      <blockquote>
        Name "Splash.dll test"<br>
        <br>
        OutFile "Splash Test.exe"<br>
        <br>
        XPStyle on<br>
        <br>
        Function .onInit<br>
        # the plugins dir is automatically deleted when the installer exits<br>
        InitPluginsDir<br>
        File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\splash.bmp "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Makensisw\logo.bmp"<br>
        #optional<br>
        #File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\splash.wav "C:\myprog\sound.wav"<br>
        <br>
        splash::show 1000 $PLUGINSDIR\splash<br>
        <br>
        Pop $0 ; $0 has '1' if the user closed the splash screen early,<br>
        ; '0' if everything closed normal, and '-1' if some error occured.<br>
        FunctionEnd<br>
        <br>
        Section<br>
        SectionEnd
      </blockquote>Certainly it serves paths good.
