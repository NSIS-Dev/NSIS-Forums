      <p class="post-content"><strong>Advice on approach to installing apache</strong><br />
      Hello.<br />
      <br />
      I am builiding an install package that installs apache at one stage, I am using the Apache windows exe. Now this is all good and working fine but I want to use an installer that installs to a different directory other than c:\program files, which is the default in the Apache installer.<br />
      <br />
      So I see a few ways I can do this which throws up some questions.<br />
      <br />
      1. I could make my own install exe package of Apache and set it up so it installs to my desired directory. <b>For this I would need to know what registry keys need to be set and which files I need to include.</b><br />
      <br />
      2. Run the installer as normal and after install, with NSIS, move the Apache directory out of Program Files to the directory I want it to be in and then reset all the keys. <b>For this I would need to know all the registry keys that need to be set in an Apache install?</b><br />
      <br />
      3. Compile my own version. BUT I am thinking that this will not help in anyway how the exe installer sets the directory to c:\program files.<br />
      <br />
      So basically what I think I need is a list of registry keys that are set by the Apache windows exe installer and what they should be set to/ represent. Where would I find this information?<br />
      <br />
      <b>OR is there a better way that anyone can think of doing this. Am I approching the problem in the correct way? The point is to get an automated installation of Apache.</b><br />
      <br />
      Thanks for taking the time to read.<br />
      <br />
      cheers<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Command line switch</strong><br />
      Maybe the command line switch would work; what is it, how would I (inject!?!?) this to the apache exe installer?<br />
      <br />
      This is the kind of advice I am looking for as I am new to this and only have to make the install package once so I have a lot of stuff to learn that I will never need to use again, which is a shame but there you go.<br />
      <br />
      thanks for reading<br />

      Funky avatar by the way Afrow, nice one.<br />

      <p class="post-content">So Afrow you would suggest something like this:<br />
      <br />
      ExecWait "apache.exe /DINSTALLDIR=c:\dira\dirb myscript.nsi"<br />
      <br />
      A couple of things I am not totally clear about here the apache.exe would need to accept and be looking for a variable INSTALLDIR, correct? I think it might be difficult to find this out as it is the standard Apache windows installer.<br />
      <br />
      And also what is the myscript.nsi referencing? What is this script.<br />
      <br />
      cheers for reading.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok Afrow nice one you pointed me in the right direction I can pass switches to the msie exe thingy. This does the trick to set the install dir:<br />
      <br />
      F:\downloadedSoftware&gt;apinst.exe /v"INSTALLDIR=\"c:\z\"<br />
      <br />
      thanks for your help man.<br />
