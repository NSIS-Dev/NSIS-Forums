      <p class="post-content"><strong>user account of the person who installed</strong><br />
      I've been fiddling with the uninstaller name.<br />
      <br />
      Short of naming an Admin uninstaller 'uninsta.exe' and a User uninstaller something else, and querying if the file exists, is there a way NSIS could be made to read who installed, a User or an Admin?<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone know how to do that? A variable, similar to $INSTDIR, which gets passed to the uninstaller, that would return the account type of whoever installed the software? Or some other method?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nsis doesn't need that, there are multiple ways to do that already. write the user-name into an ini file or the registry or whatever.</p>

      </blockquote>No variables are EVER passed to the uninstaller. Not even $INSTDIR. As you can find in the manual: "in uninstaller code, $INSTDIR contains the directory where the uninstaller lies."

      <p class="post-content">The help file just says $INSTDIR may be a different location in the uninstaller.<br />

      Hate to quibble, but that's all it says. You can take from that, that the variable is not passed to the uninstaller, which of course it isn't.<br />
      <br />
      Why can't variables be passed to the uninstaller?<br />
      <br />
      I think Yathosho said it, nsis doesn't need that. I agree -- why argue?</p>

      </blockquote>If you look at the manual again, you will see that you are wrong about this. From <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.2.2" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.2.2</a><br />

      "Note that in uninstaller code, $INSTDIR contains the directory where the uninstaller lies. It does <b>not</b> necessarily contain the same value it contained in the installer. <font color="red">For example, if you write the uninstaller to $WINDIR and the user doesn't move it, $INSTDIR will be $WINDIR in the uninstaller.</font> If you write the uninstaller to another location, you should keep the installer's $INSTDIR in the registry or an alternative storing facility and read it in the uninstaller."

      <p class="post-content">You actually can move it and $INSTDIR will change; I didn't know that. Now I do. I was wrong.<br />
      <br />
      On reflection, I also think, it might not be the safest if you could pass variables to the uninstaller. Like, if you pass the installer account type as standard user and you make a mistake, the account type is really admin. The safest place for that info is the registry, which can't err. I was wrong.</p>
