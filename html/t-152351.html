      Hi Joost,<br />
      <br />
      I just picked up the development snapshot and built my installer (after dealing with the latest required moving of page option settings), and I notice that my "Welcome to the ... Wizard" large bold text is clipped a *little* bit at the bottom (it runs to three lines).<br />
      <br />
      We are only talking about 1 or 2 rows of pixels, BTW. :)<br />
      <br />
      My Windows 2000 box is set to use "Large fonts" (120 dpi). I use the "MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION" !define before all of my MUI_PAGE_* !insertmacro statements.<br />
      <br />
      A question about the "MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION" and "MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC" settings - do they do the same thing, and do either or both of them build a smaller installer?</p>

      <p class="post-content">To make the text box on the welcome page larger, you should make a custom copy of ioSpecial.ini and edit the bottom key (think it's in Field 1)<br />
      Then you can set the custom ini file by using:<br />
      !define MUI_SPECIALINI "${NSISDIR}\Path\To\myIOini.ini"<br />
      <br />
      I think MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION removes the page descriptions (like e.g. "here you enter the directory in which to install ${MUI_PRODUCT}"), and MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC just removes the section descriptions.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'll check that Welcome page problem.<br />
      <br />
      Using MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION you can change the UI resource used by the MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC. Not using descriptions won't really make your installer smaller.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, Joost!<br />
      <br />
      That adjustment you made to the points/weight (or whatever you actually tweaked) worked out fine for me.<br />
      <br />
      I think that the reason this became a problem for me is that since the last release of my product at the end of July, you have "collapsed" MUI's separate product name and version strings into the single [non-MUI] "Name" directive, which took away some of my fine-grained control of when "product" is used and when "product+version" is used. :(<br />
      <br />
      It was never clear to me why you did this... but I have to assume you saw a need for it.<br />
      <br />
      So, in the end, I preferred the bigger font on the Welcome page, but with you now using the NSIS "Name" value (which for me is "product+version"), the field became too small.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can still control where you want product and product+version. For example, you can set Name to product and Caption to product+version.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Once again, thanks, Joost!<br />
      <br />
      That was really what I was looking for... so you didn't really take away any fine-grained control, you just quit having special MUI control over Name and Caption.<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and you can go back to the larger font on the Welcome page now... :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">The title uses the standard dialog font now (Tahoma on 2000/XP) instead of Verdana. That's because XP wizards also use this font.</p>
