      <p class="post-content"><strong>2.0b4 huge tempfile during makensis</strong><br />
      I am using 2.0b4 to make a large installer (~500 MB). I notice that makensis appears to be writing the entire uncompressed archive into a temp file before it finally writes out the final bzipped installer.<br />
      <br />
      Can't the final file just be written out without any temp file being needed?<br />
      <br />
      Is there some option I am unintentionally using that is forcing this behavior?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Furthermore, it is doing the same thing during the install. I install on the D drive but the C drive gets a huge temp file created on in during the install. Ouch -- to install 500 MB of files on one drive I need 500 MB on TWO drives?</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's solid compression. On the compiler side it collects everything it needs as one block and then compresses it along with the headers. On the installer side it's there so it won't have to start over if it needs to extract a file that was already uncompresses in the solid block. You can edit config.h and recompile bzip2 or lzma exeheads without solid compression or just use zlib if you want to avoid this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Is it possible for you to do the above and make it avaliable to the less technically ept of us please?<br />
      I'd like a nonsolid lzma if thats possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Is there anyone here willing to do a once off compile for me? I am happy with beta5, and this is the only feature I really need.<br />
      <br />
      It'd be much appreciated.</p>
