      <p class="post-content"><strong>Help with ZipDLL</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Can any 1 help me with how to make the ZipDLL work ?:(<br />
      <br />
      I have followed the instructions in the readme which came with it. It compiles ok when I put a '!endif' right after the line:<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro ZIPDLL_EXTRACT "C:\unzipped\ZipDLL\test.zip" "c:\output\" "&lt;ALL&gt;"<br />
      <br />
      but it only make a folder named 'output' but dosent extract anyfiles. :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      Sample code<br />
      <br />
      ;--------------------------------<br />
      ;Include Modern UI<br />
      <br />
      !include "MUI.nsh"<br />
      !include "ZipDLL.nsh"<br />
      <br />
      ;--------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      ;Installer Sections<br />
      <br />
      Section<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro ZIPDLL_EXTRACT "C:\unzipped\ZipDLL\test.zip" "c:\output\" "&lt;ALL&gt;"<br />
      <br />
      !endif<br />
      <br />
      Does putting a !endif is the problem here ? without it it dosent compile. Gives a error like:<br />
      !if[macro][n]def: open at EOF - need !endif<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi again ..<br />
      <br />
      Well, I checked your problem and it appears that there is a slight error in the header file : an 'endif' is commented and should not be. That is for the compilation problem. For the rest, well, it looks like your script is missing a couple of instructions..<br />
      <br />
      Please download the fixed header file and try this, it should work... Otherwise let me know :)<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
;--------------------------------
<br />;Include Modern UI
<br /><br />&gt;!include "MUI.nsh"
<br />&gt;!include "ZipDLL.nsh"
<br />&gt;;--------------------------------
<br /><br />&gt;OutFile "c:\unzipped\testzipdll.exe" ; &lt;- this was missing
<br /><br />Section
<br /><br />&gt;!insertmacro ZIPDLL_EXTRACT "C:\unzipped\ZipDLL\test.zip" "c:\output\" "&lt;ALL&gt;"
<br /><br />SectionEnd ; &lt;- this was missing 
<br />&gt;

      </blockquote>Well don't worry for that I thought you had the instructions in the script but it was just in case... ;)<br />
      <br />
      For the spanned files, I suggest you to read the following threads. There are quite long but the "problem" does not have an immediate solution apparently..<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanx again:) I'll check out those forum links and the zip file.<br />
      <br />
      Hope it'll solve my prob. Wonder why NSIS dosent support making a spanned exe. more easily:rolleyes: Most of other setup builders have it.(like Inno Setup) I hope they put this option in the next release. cuz a lot of ppl will benefit from it:up:<br />
      well umm... at least me! :D<br />

      <p class="post-content">That Hjsplit.exe is really nice. but it takes a bit more time and space to re join the thing and extract the joined file from the users HDD. It'll work fine with small files but what about large 1's ? :(<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I heard that Spanning facility will be available in NSIS 2.1. That'll be really nice :up:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Err, sorry Wreckles I didn't think about huge files... :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Well I hope for you that the release 2.1 will include this feature, but as the version 2.0 was released very recently you'll probably have to find another way to do it...<br />
      <br />
      Good luck :)<br />
