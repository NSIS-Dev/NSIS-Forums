      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to check if a soft is installed?</strong><br />
      Hi all, I just discovered that wonderfull NSIS!!<br />
      Powerful, but complicated :)<br />
      <br />
      So, I am trying to look if a software is installed, and if it is, to read its path in the registery.<br />
      <br />
      I know I can find this in the registery<br />
      <br />
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ActiveState\ActiveTcl\8.4.8.0 --&gt; (default) REG_SZ C:\thepath<br />
      <br />
      But I didn't manage to find it and then read it ...<br />
      <br />
      Im pretty unfamiliar with registery function of NSIS and even with the registery by itself...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      This<br />
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=875&amp;instances=0,11,770" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/...ances=0,11,770</a><br />
      <br />
      seems interesting (if I succeed to install it :D ), but I don't know exactly what to put in args to find my key and then read it.<br />
      <br />
      Thx for your help!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">After some tests,<br />
      IfKeyExists "HKLM" "SOFTWARE" "ActiveState"<br />
      <br />
      Seems to be working, but I still can't test deeper to check the subdirectories.<br />
      <br />
      (IfKeyExists "HKLM" "SOFTWARE" "ActiveState\ActiveTcl\8.4.8.0") doesn't works.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      And I still can't access that RG_SZ with the path :'(</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've not tested it, but just looking at the macro code at <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=875&amp;instances=0,11,770," target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/...nces=0,11,770,</a> it appears that you should be calling the macro this way:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />!insertmacro IfKeyExists "HKLM" "SOFTWARE\ActiveState\ActiveTcl" "8.4.8.0"<br />pop $R0<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      $R0 should then contain 1 if the reg key exists.

      <p class="post-content">IfKeyExists?? never heard of that one and i can't find it in the docs. anyway, that question was asked so often (and is surely listed in the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/support/faq/" target="_blank">faq</a>) that you should find the when answer searching this forum.</p>

      <p class="post-content">!insertmacro IfKeyExists "HKLM" "SOFTWARE\ActiveState\ActiveTcl" "8.4.8.0"<br />
      pop $R0<br />
      <br />
      Doesn't work : it don't find the key any more :(<br />
      <br />
      How can I do ?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I have another little problem : how to code a if {} else {} section?<br />
      <br />
      I don't find explanations in the documentation and my try isn't working :<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      StrCmp $R0 "1" Iftest NIftest<br />
      NIftest:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK "Didn't find it $R0"<br />
      Iftest:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK '"Finded!! Pas besoin installer $R0"'<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When it don't find it, it also execute the "Finded" code :'(</p>

      <p class="post-content">Do you have permissions to that part of the registry?<br />
      <br />
      You've got me curious now, too, so when I get some free time later tonight, I can try to setup a quick test.<br />
      <br />
      The If-then code should be included in the LogicLib header. (There's an example of its usage in the examples folder included with NSIS setup.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, it seems to work for me.<br />
      <br />
      Since I didn't have the software, I manually edited my registry to create the proper keys. Then, I built a very simply install using the exact same code from Vytautas at the archive site listed above. It worked exactly like I expected it to.<br />
      <br />
      I zipped the REG file I used along with the same script (attached). Feel free to look it over.</p>
