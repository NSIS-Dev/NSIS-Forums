But there is no instruction to write it directly. :cry:<br><br>So I used WriteRegStr to set directly the variables in the Windows registry (HKCU/Environment). But Windows does not care about the changes. I have to go to the Windows environment variables dialog, then select OK to make it work. Rebooting the computer work too.

However, they're not, they're something implemented in C that you can "include". Surely you can put KiCHiK's stuff into functions/macros in NSIS in a .nsh file or whatever and "include" them and hey voila you have a similar solution to that in C and no need for bloating the compiler.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd August 2002 12:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Here it is, enjoy :D<br><br>[edit]Attachment removed.
