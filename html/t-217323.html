I'm looking for a Windows product that will allow users to easily specify the installation (point'n'click) to get started with a nice NSIS project quickly.<br><br>I know there are several (!!!) projects available on SourceForge that wrap NSIS installer in a GUI, but they seem to be alpha/pre-beta - or to be honest, pretty crappy - tools.<br><br>I've previously used InstallShield Express which is a nice (but extremely buggy) user-interface for building Windows Installer packages. I was wondering if a NSIS equivalent exists? Something an average user can use; without needing programming knowledge; and not just an editor!! Needs to handle files, registry, shortcuts, dialog editor, scripts/systemcheck/behaviour inclusion by point'n'click.<br><br>Any advise? What do you use?<br>Do I have to develop it myself :)<br><br>regards<br>bjarke<br><a href="http://www.viksoe.dk/gmail" target="_blank">http://www.viksoe.dk/gmail</a></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">vbgunz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th May 2005 20:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I've used HM NSIS Edit to get me started. I didn't rely on it to do everything but I've used it to start the base template. From there, I just used help and posted unanswered questions here on this forum. The help here is astounding. It seems everyones itching to help you out.<br><br>As far as I know about there being a do-everything NSIS GUI, we'll I've never heard of it. I don't even think there is any on the horizon. I am currently working with a developer on building a brand new IO designer. Word is he will have a beta out by this Monday or Tuesday. We'll have to wait and see.<br><br>If you find anything interesting I for one am interested.
