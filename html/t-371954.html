If you believe the flagging of your software is wrong you could try contacting MS but I doubt you'll get far.

Essentially even if your stuff is OK it will still bitch assuming you don't have many users out there. Once we publish an update it often takes a day or two until smartscreen doesn't bitch anymore - presumable because enough people have downloaded and installed it which then makes smartscreen believe it's safe enough for the general public.<br><br>What helped a lot for us was properly signing the generated installer. Sure, it means spending some money for a certificate etc. but it's worth the effort considering you also have proof that your installer hasn't been tampered with, this also means a warm and fuzzy feeling for your customers considering the error message windows gives you is less "insisting". ;)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
