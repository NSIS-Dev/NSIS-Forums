      <p class="post-content"><strong>Version Information</strong><br />
      I am trying to grab the value of a user defined field from the Version tab in File Properties. From searching, I have found VIAddVersionKey, which does the exact opposite of what I want. Instead of setting these keys, is there any way to read them? I know there is a plug-in for this (MoreInfo), but I am not allowed to use plug-ins, so I was hoping to do it within base NSIS. Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">The only native NSIS instruction is GetDllVersion and it only grabs the version number.<br />

      You could call VerQueryValue and friends with the system plugin but that is a lot of work just to avoid a 3rd party plugin...</p>

      <p class="post-content">First time using a plug-in, I've downloaded and extracted the MoreInfo.zip, have moved MoreInfo.dll into C:\Program Files\NSIS\plugins, but don't see any .nsh files to move into C:\Program Files\NSIS\Include. Am I missing something, or maybe my extract didn't work correctly?<br />
      <br />
      Also, is there a specific !include line I need to include in my .nsi file? Thanks :winamp:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's what I have right now that's not working:<br />
      <br />
      MoreInfo::GetUserDefined "$INSTDIR\BEP.exe" "BuildLabel"<br />
      Pop $0<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK $0<br />
      <br />
      MoreInfo.dll has been moved to plugin folder, no !includes up top, from what I've read what I have should output "3.2.0.1" in my messagebox, but a blank string is being displayed. Any thoughts? In all the threads containing "MoreInfo" everyone seems to get it working right away, too frustrating! :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Have gone through examples, my paths are correct, BuildLabel is correct,....</p>

        I know there is a plug-in for this (MoreInfo), but I am not allowed to use plug-ins, so I was hoping to do it within base NSIS.
      </blockquote>No plug-ins at all? Or no plug-ins that that don't ship with the "official" NSIS installer?<br />
      <br />
      In the former case will probably notice that your installer already <b>is</b> using plug-ins, because many (basic) things in NSIS need plug-ins. Especially if you use MUI or MUI2, you installer definitely <i>does</i> use plug-ins. And that's not a bad thing, it's simply how things work.<br />
      <br />
      In the second case, why not use plug-in that does exactly what you need? Trying to emulate the same thing with the System plug-in of NSIS is much more difficult and more error prone! I'd rather trust a third-party plug-in than reinvent the wheel.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, if using third-party plug-ins isn't possible for whatever reason, writing your own plug-ins for NSIS isn't rocked science. If you already have a basic knowledge about C/C++ and you know how to use Visual Studio, you can probably implement it yourself in one hour. What you'd need is <a href="http://GetFileVersionInfo" target="_blank">GerFileVersionInfo</a> plus <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms647464%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank">VerQueryValue</a> and that's it.
