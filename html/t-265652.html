<code>File "Installation Files\\PROG\FILE_NAME"
<br>&gt;PLUGIN::checkFilesDates "$0\\FILE_NAME" "$INSTDIR\\FILE_NAME"

<br>&gt;GoTo +2
<br>Delete "$0\\FILE_NAME" 
</code>
</pre>So all these lines duplicated for 11821 files make a script file of 11Mo. I need this code because it checks for file existence, backup it if needed (and if no backup is already present), log the operation and the copy it to its destination. I guess I'll need to do this from my plugin after having extracted the directory content from a zip file.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, thanks. If anybody has an idea, don't hesitate.<br>

      <p class="post-content">IDEA:<br>
      <br>
      Use a separate INI file in a ZIP which contains all file names, then USE NSIS plugin to unzip the INI to HD temp and read the INI line by line to test for file existence.<br>
      <br>
      Be creative ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Have you simply tried to compile the script with just makensis.exe?<br>
      <br>
      I remember when I tried to compile very large script with HM NIS Edit, I got the same error. But when I compiled the script with just makensis it worked.<br>
      <br>
      I think the 'Out of memory' error occurs simply because the length of NSIS output in the HM NIS Edit console exceed certain length.<br>
      <br>
      So you can probably compile the script with HM NIS Edit simply by adding this '!verbose 3' in the beginning of your script. I will reduce the output from NSIS. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, that's a good idea. Now that you say it, I remember that the lat output of the editor was quite weird. I should have thought about it.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, I tried your suggestion "!verbose 3" and it seems to correct the problem. Now there is the problem that I need more than one hour (it is still running and it has for a long time) to build it :-)<br>
      <br>
      I guess I will stick to the zip version, it is not as clean but a lot faster.<br>

      Thanks a lot for your answers and your suggestions.<br>

      </blockquote>Great. :) If you are using solid compression you could try non-solid (E.g non-solid zlib). It should speed things up significantly, but if your zip is already bigger than 2GB, don't bother. ;)<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hi and thanks for your suggestions.<br>
      <br>
      I left the compiler when I left yesterday and it has finished the compilation process. From the modification time of the generated installer I can say that it took about 1 hour, 1 hour and a half to compile it.<br>
      <br>
      The problem is not the size of the installer (~86Mo). As I said, there are a lot of files (more than 10000) and a few lines for each file results in a 10Mo script file. From the last log lines of the compiler, I can see that there are 266289 instructions in total. So I suppose I understand the tile to compile all of this :-)<br>
      <br>
      I will try your suggestions (non-solid compression) but I don't think it should help.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks,<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hi again !<br>
      <br>
      I was using bzip2 compression, not solid. I tried zip compression, supposed to be faster, but it took it exactly one hour to build the installer. Anyway, it seems it is a bit overwhelmed by the huge amount of lines of code in the script.<br>
      <br>
      I will revert to my custom zip solution : extracting my zip file to a temp directory and then doing all the file check, backup and log from my plugin. I will have a progress bar stalling during that operation but it will be much faster (building the installer and running it).<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, thanks for all your help.<br>
      <br>
