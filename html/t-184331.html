Well the installation started, but it gave "corrupted" error messages on different places. Sometimes it would show the error on the main exe file, then on the stuff files.It just kept giving out random error messages. I think it's my HDD....gotta change it. One advice to you all : DON'T BUY SEAGATE HARD DRIVES!!! . They're extremely buggy(at least the 40GB ones).Many friends who have it, have problems with files, just like me.<br><br>Anyway, I'll redownload the file, and hopefully, this time it will install.<br><br>But...im wondering, why do i get the "file corrupted" error message on EVERY , nsis installer?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">rsegal</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd June 2004 22:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I've encountered this problem with some of the users of our software. Very often getting them to download from an alternate download site corrected the problem. Not sure if you're able to do that in your case but thought I'd toss in my experiences.<br><br>Knowing some more of the specs about your system may help to understand why the installers aren't running for you. i.e. What OS, do you have latest Windows updates installed, etc.<br><br>Rob Segal<br>Software Developer<br><a href="http://www.3dna.net" target="_blank">www.3dna.net</a></p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
