      <br>
      script needs to elevate for writing in programfiles.<br>
      <br>
      but as i see (x86) - user uses the wrong branch in its 64bit system.<br>
      it need to set setregview to 32 or 64 to get the 32bit or 64bit registry tree<br>
      so there is no wonder why i always catch no value<br>

      nsis is a formerly 32bit program so it access is not this branch<br>
      HKLM "\software\mycompany\otherstuff\filelocations"<br>
      <br>
      it access is at HKLM "\software\<b>wow3264node</b>\mycompany\otherstuff\filelocations"<br>

      or do you try to install from admin account (different logon) in a users place?<br>

      </blockquote>Actually, yes it does. If you elevate to an administrator user, you are running as that user. HKCU and APPDATA etc. no longer point to the original user's registry/files. For the registry if you need to write to HKCU for all user accounts, you can use EnumUsersReg (Google it).<br>

      <p class="post-content">This plug in is a bit confusing. So it actually runs a 2nd copy? How do I separate what I want done at user level and pass that into the inner admin copy to have the right data. Initally I thought by running this addon I could just elivate the current install, but I'm guessing that just can't be done. The samples don't quite cover what I need.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The UAC plugin was designed for only one thing: Allowing the Run checkbox at the finish page to execute at userlevel instead of as admin.<br>
      <br>
      Installation should always either be done at userlevel for singleuser (HKCU) or at adminlevel for allusers (HKLM). That's how Windows is designed. Doing it differently is possible, but not proper and prone to problems.</p>

      </blockquote>Because of different feature requests the AsUser macro was designed to be generic but that does not mean the things you can do with it are a good idea! Any time you break away from the per user or per machine install paradigm you are probably adding bugs (if there are several users on the same machine), the exception is the run checkbox since the install is complete and all you are doing is saving the user from having to start your app from the startmenu. (There can probably be other scenarios, just remember that when a different user starts your application the AsUser action has not taken place)<br>
