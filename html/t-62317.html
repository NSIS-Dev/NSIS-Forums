I think adding the ASS io routines will be a bit pointless, imho. A better addition would be including a free linker, such as ALINK and working out the dependencies of the user required features and then only linking the required object files (a bit like what my 'new' version does). For smaller installers, you may only need the ZLIB inflate code and a basic interface. I was also wondering whether generating machine code from makensis would be better in the long run as at the moment the 'IL' code at the end is pretty much perfectly decompilable (except you dont get function names etc)..<br><br>Peter.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Koen van de Sande</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th October 2001 18:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The branding text changes the NSIS v1.55 text into something of yourself.
