      <p class="post-content"><strong>debugging InstallOptions problem [linux]</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      When I compile the 2.08 InstallOptions plugin on debian, and use it in the WordFunc.nsi example, it fails to show the dialog due to the call to CreateDialog returning NULL. The error returned from GetLastError is 0 "the operation completed successfully" :/<br />
      <br />
      The weird thing is that the makefile system I hacked up for 2.06 works, while the Scons build stuff in 2.08 does not. The resulting installer segfaults, but the same happens with installers that use the windows-compiled plugin, so thats a separate issue.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone have any idea what might be wrong with the Scons stuff? I tried adding -mwindows and a couple of other things, no change though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Something very similar happened <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=212630&amp;highlight=linux" target="_blank">here</a>. The generated installer failed on CreateDialog in exactly the same way. I think it might be a problem with the dialog resource, but I've never really researched it deeply enough.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, thing is that the 2.06 compile works, but 2.08 does not.<br />
      <br />
      Also, when I dump the resources from each dll using ResHacker, the text version is exactly the same.<br />
      <br />
      Hmm, perhaps the mingw-exehead incorrectly decompresses the plugin file?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I noticed that, of the example nsi files, only a couple actually work with the scons built 2.08 debian package.<br />
      <br />
      I tested them all under cygwin gdb on winxp and got the following backtraces (many were similar/the same):<br />

      <br />
      A number of them seemed to cause problems for gdb - exhaustion of virtual memory and internal errors and stuff.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure where to go from here, apart from keeping 2.06 in debian, since the examples have only a couple of segfaults and minimal problems.

      <p class="post-content">I've managed to get the installer not to segfault (attached). It has the exact same problem as in the <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=212630&amp;highlight=linux" target="_blank">other thread</a>. I've checked out 2.06's deb, and it also contains bad section order and was probably working just by chance. It seems like the linker script never really worked.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Good to know I'm not stupid anyhow :-) , building on FreeBSD is difficult and challenging to say the least. Did not have much time last weeks but as soon as possible I'll bug the forum again with problem when buiding on other OS's. I also will be procative as soon as I have ONCE a succesful build on FreeBSD via SCons. A Wiki page will be extended explaining what to do to create a successful build on Linux, FreeBSD, and if possible a MAC Intel.</p>

      <p class="post-content">InstallOptions fails because MinGW decided DllMain isn't the main function. It's set its own entry point and ignored DllMain. Because of this, m_hInstance is not defined properly and CreateDialog can't find the appropriate resource. The problem is the entry flag for ld which points to _DllMain@16 instead of _DllMain@12. ld doesn't complain and so the wrong entry point is used. I've fixed this in the latest CVS version. I'll upload a patch once I find a fix for the first problem too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've ended up using ld's default linker script. It's probably version specific and might not work that well with other versions, but it's better than the last one. I've also fixed its usage. Previously, it was passed to ld using -Wl and not -T as it should be.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The patch worked perfectly, all of the installers worked fine and didn't show any strange problems. I've applied this patch to debian nsis 2.08-3 and will upload it to debian eperimental soon.<br />
      <br />
      One exception was BgImage Test.exe, which segfaulted. The backtrace was something like this:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>ntdll<br />ntdll<br />SetBg<br />SetBg<br />?<br />?<br />?<br />...</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      I'll recompile the plugin with debugging info and get a real backtrace and fix for this issue either later tonight or tomorrow morning.

      <p class="post-content">Ok, the problem with BgImage.dll is that the critical section object is not initialised, because DllMain is not entered. According to objectdump -x and the MSVC dependency walker, BgImage.dll doesn't even export a DllMain. The windows nsis 2.08 Plugins don't seem to export the DllMain either.<br />
      <br />
      This is with the patch. I've attached the BgImage plugin (with debugging messageboxes).</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, I tested the InstallOptions plugin, and the DllMain from it also does not get called. However, the Banner plugin does get it's DllMain call. After testing some more of the plugins, it seems like the C++ plugins are the ones that are broken, the C ones are fine.</p>
