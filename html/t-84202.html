      <p class="post-content"><strong>Weird Quotes Suggestion</strong><br />
      I have a suggestion for the quotes. Instead of using the actual weird system, NSIS can use two quotes when another quote is used inside that one. exemples:<br />
      <br />
      this is the actual system used in NSIS:<br />
      <br />
      Exec 'REGEDIT.EXE /S "Registry\Delete Current User - RIT.REG"'<br />
      <br />
      this is what I suggest:<br />
      Exec ""REGEDIT.EXE /S "Registry\Delete Current User - RIT.REG"""<br />
      <br />
      I think it's easier and we avoid working with weird characters like ' and Â´.</p>

      <p class="post-content">After an empty string there's a carriage return, isn't it?<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, what's the point of "empty strings"? I read in documentation that when are specified the default is used.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I meant to say that it's a lot easier to work with<br />
      `Hi this 'is "some" text' string`<br />
      than with<br />
      "Hi this "is "some" text" string"<br />
      for the reason mentioned in the previous post (not easy to see what quotes start a string and which end one inside a string. Besides that, in the example above, it's not clear what is wanted:<br />
      this:<br />
      "Hi this " ... "some" ... "string"<br />
      or this:<br />
      "Hi this is some text string"<br />
      "is some text"<br />
      "some"<br />
      (so with substrings...).<br />
      I hope you see, that to overcome this confusion, we need different quotes.<br />

      """Hi this ""is "some" text"" string"""<br />

      which is clear and uses the same character for the same function.<br />

    <br />
    Ok. I am a general user of NSIS, and I understand your advices, but when should we use a space surrounded by a double quote?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    And a question: the only problem this suggestion faces is the empty string and the quoted space?<br />

      <p class="post-content">A space can be necessary to seperate words...<br />
      Eg.: when editing a file with some script that might construct the sentence using words or something...<br />
      <br />
      You can think of numerous examples why it might be nessecary.<br />
      <br />
      Only using double quotes is to restrictive in general. It might be possible for some applications, but not for all!!!<br />
      <br />
      BTW, feel free to adapt the source if you do not agree :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sorry Smile2Me I didn't understand your reply. I know that spaces are used to separate words.<br />
      <br />
      Was this reply an answer to the two questions I asked before?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Another thing, I am not thinking of changing the source to adapt it to the use of double quotes. My suggestion was to simplify the quotes system. If we don't simplify them it will remain complex, that's all :)<br />

          It's true that if NSIS developers implement this system we can break some scripts, but we can find a workaround :cool: NSIS could handle for some versions the two quote systems, although just one is described in the documentation. If you (ever) decide to implement directly the double quote system, you can make NSIS report this compilation error like this "changed quote policy, please read NSIS documentation".<br />
          <br />
          But NSIS developers only have to implement the double quote system if we, users, found that this system is better than the other.<br />

      You don't see the need because there's no need when you already know how to work with it.<br />

          </blockquote>All of the above. The current method does not have any limitations as far as I can tell. Why change something that is not broken to something that will offer nothing new. No one is not using NSIS because of its quoting system. In fact, the docs clearly state how to use it.

          <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
          <br />
          Just my 2 cents worth.<br />
          For starters I'm happy with the current quoting system although I'd like to actually see it extended to handle most of the non-alpha numeric chars so that ^asdf ghjk^ would for example also be a quoted string.<br />
          <br />
          The "Quote -&gt;""&lt;- Quote" style is used by VB/VBSCRIPT as well as rexx (which also supports multiple quote characters) and probably other languages but is a real pain when used with preprocessors (and I think also less readable).<br />
          It is much easier to say my string will never contain character 'x' and use it for quotes than to double up quotes where the string might be built out of multiple components and used for multiple purposes.<br />

              See You,</b> Since the method currently used by NSIS is used by many programming and scripting languages, I don't see how your method would improve its usability. Since most people who are creating their installers are developers, there's not a problem here. I've never seen your method used anywhere and it has its flaws which were already pointed out.
