      <p class="post-content"><strong>Strange error message.</strong><br />
      Hello, I get this message in a pop up window whenever I try to install Dragon Age, which uses the NSIS 2.34 installer.<br />
      <br />
      <b>"Bad Start Menu value. Too short."</b><br />
      <br />
      It happens during the "Select a Start Menu folder:" window, right after I click "Next &gt;"<br />
      <br />
      I'm almost certain it's because I try to install the application sandboxed, as I do with almost all my apps, to avoid any leftover clutter after I remove it later. I use Sandboxie for this.<br />
      <br />
      My question is what the error message above actually means. I've tried giving the installer full access to the start menu paths but get the same message. I've tried a variety of names and had no success either.<br />
      <br />
      I've searched with google and also used the various searches here and in the wiki and found nothing about the error. If I knew what exactly it means and why it's generated, I might be able to come up with a workaround.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Could that message come from some kind of script you are using? I don't think NSIS itself has any limits on short paths</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's the first time I've seen that message and I've installed various applications and games hundreds of times now.<br />
      Granted, it might be they customized the installer script, so it's non standard.<br />
      <br />
      I also get the error even if I elect to have no start menu created.<br />
      <br />
      If anyone can confirm whether the error message above is actually part of NSIS or not, it would be a big step forward :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">You said you used Sandboxie, that really alters the way windows works so you might want to give it a go without it.<br />
      <br />
      As far as figuring out if the installer has customized stuff, there is not much you can do. You can check in %temp%\ns???? while the installer is running to see a list of plugins used, but no real way to check the inner workings of the installer if they have some sort of path checking</p>

      <p class="post-content">I checked the temp directories and there were indeed several plugins used. Unfortunately I have no real expereience with them so it does me little good.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you anyway for your help :)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Edit: I upgraded to the latest version of sandboxie and installed without a hitch. I don't know if it's the upgrade that did it or some other factor, but at least everything works now.</p>
