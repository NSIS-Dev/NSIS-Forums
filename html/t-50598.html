Note that /D= must be the last parameter on the line.<br>Made it so you can specify "" or no parameter to ComponentText to not display the Component page and automatically install all sections.<br>Made it so that if you use DirShow hide, but still specify a valid DirText, it will still show the directory page if .onVerifyInstDir fails.<br>Made it so you can specify "" or no parmater to DirText to not display the Directory page (ever).<br>Made WriteReg* and DeleteReg* allow variables in subkey.<br>Simplified some of the uninstall parsing code.<br>Fixed InstallDirRegKey's handling of strings that point to an EXE that doesn't exist (it assumed that the EXE name was the directory if the EXE didn't exist, but now it only thinks the EXE name is a directory if there is a directory that exists there)<br>Made it so the installer is always shown at the end of the install, if hidden with HideWindow and window auto-closing is off.<br>Added SetAutoClose command/instruction (lets you override AutoCloseWindow)<br>Added /WINDOWS switch to InstallColors<br>Documentation overhaul<br><br>...<br><br>What is the actual latest version?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">arune</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th May 2001 07:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">That is really a difficult question :-) Are you serious?<br>The version number works like this: The higher, the newer!<br>If you´re still not certain, you can always look at the date, the same there: The higher the newer!<br><br>Or...
