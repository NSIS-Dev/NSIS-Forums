      <p class="post-content"><strong>$INSTDIR removes the colon in path</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I retrieve a path from the registry to $INSTDIR. If the path is for example D:\Folder (sans quotes) then no problem. BUT, if the path is contained within quotes as in "C:\Program Files" then NSIS removes the colon!<br />
      Retrieving first to a variable (correct path) and then assigning it to $INSTDIR also removes the colon.<br />
      The path does exists and there is nothing before the quote. This must be a bug surely.<br />
      Please help?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the replies, but I still can't get it to work.<br />
      HKLM "Software\Folder" "Location" contains "D:\Temp" (with quotes)<br />
      <br />
      ReadRegStr $R0 HKLM "Software\Folder" "Location"<br />
      $R0 contains D:\Temp<br />
      <br />
      StrCpy $INSTDIR $R0<br />
      $INSTDIR contains D\Temp (sans colon)<br />
      <br />
      Any ideas?<br />
      Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm. Could it be that the regstring contains a fullwidth colon, that the $INSTDIR variable sanitization code cannot handle? Try writing a new string D:\Temp to the registry before reading it.</p>

        Paths with imbedded spaces are never surrounded by quotes in the registry.
      </blockquote>They are sometimes, depends on the key and which program wrote the entry. (Paths that can be executed are often quoted, HKCR\txtfile\shell\open\command etc)<br />

      either your code or your environment is corrupted.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi Brummelchen,<br />
      <br />
      I don't think it is a bug, or that my code/installation is corrupt, more ignorance on my part. The situation was this. I was running a test and needed a path in the registry which I entered manually. The path was going to be used in a cmd file to be run subsequently with “ExecWait” so the quotes were necessary. Because there were spaces in the path I (wrongly) entered the path in the registry enclosed in quotes. This resulted in the colon being stripped when reading into $INSTDIR. After removing the quotes in the registry path $INSTDIR contained the correct path including the spaces. I now place the quotes around the path when building my command line.<br />
      <br />
      Regards.</p>

<br />   ${IfNot} $R7 == ""

<br />      Push $R9
<br />        Call Trim
<br />      Pop $R9
<br />      StrCpy $INSTDIR $R9
<br />    ${EndIf}
<br />  ${EndIf}

<br /><br />  Done:

<br />&gt;

</pre>this blows code a bit but i have several routines like that.<br />
      <br />
      path in registry in quotes are in most cases only needed when a parameter is added, windows itself is capable to handle. if you work in a batch environment (commandline) you need to add always quotes eg. <font color="blue">dir /on "c:\program files\"</font> to avoid errors.<br />
      <br />
      @="c:\my.exe"<br />
      <br />
      @="\"c:\my.exe\" \"%1\""<br />
      <br />
      $\" adds a quote within a string (nsis)<br />
      <br />
      if you work with nsis commandline parameters you have to determine wether they are in quotes or not - nsis wiki contains some examples.<br />
