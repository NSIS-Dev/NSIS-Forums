Now about what selections will be selected by each install type, you can use the command <i>SectionIn</i> and put in the parameter <i>insttype_index</i> the indexes of the install types you want the section to be included in (i.e. SectionIn 1 2 3). The indexes are the order of installer types.<br><br><font color="red">[EDITED]</font><blockquote>whats the difference in quality between a .mod file n the other normal formats like mp3, wma, etc</blockquote>MOD music has a reduced size compared to other types. But it has a number of defined pitches (like playing a instrument) limiting the possibilities of making some varieties of songs.

        <p class="post-content">ive tried google. the reason y i want that is im using music in my installer n the script uses .mod\.xm etc type files.<br>
        <br>
        i need help on this last thing :<br>
        ive added a custom page with this code :<br>
        <br></p>

        <blockquote>
          PageEx license<br>
          Caption "Readme"<br>
          LicenseData "files\extra\readme.txt"<br>
          LicenseText "Read Me File" "Next &gt;"<br>
          LicenseForceSelection off<br>
          PageExEnd
        </blockquote>now the thing with this is, the header and sub header shows the license agreement header n sub header.<br>
        <br>
        how do i change the header n sub header with the code ive used.<br>
        <br>
        these commands dont work with it :<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <blockquote>
          !define MUI_PAGE_HEADER_TEXT "Read Me"<br>
          !define MUI_PAGE_HEADER_SUBTEXT "Please review the Read Me before proceeding.

        <p class="post-content">Now I can catch it, you're saying about converting that script that Takhir gave you to be .mod playable. There was an example on that older thread about .mod music some script examples which played .mod/.xm music. Give a search and you'll find what you want.</p>
