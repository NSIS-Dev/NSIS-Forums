      <p class="post-content"><strong>System::Call to run file</strong><br />
      Ok, Im having a hard time here... I know there is a way to use System::Call to run a file, but I cant seem to find where I saw it at.<br />
      <br />
      If only psexec would support UNC paths... :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      Anyone have suggestions?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why use System::Call instead of Exec, ExecWait, ExecShell or nsExec? What's psexec?</p>

      I need to use System::Call to execute a batch file that points to a network share to execute other files.<br />
      <br />
      PSExec is a small application that lets you run commands on a remote system. Personally, I use that to push out the applications I create with NSIS (using the -icf switch). The one big drawback to it is that it does not support network references when using the application.<br />
      <br />
      What I was hoping to do is to put in the System::Call at the end of my NSIS script to execute a file on a network resource. Hopefully by using System::Call, it will trick windows into executing the batch file as the current user that is logged in and not as the LocalService account that PSExec uses.<br />
      <br />
      Heres the link for PSExec for any that are interested:<br />

      <p class="post-content">System::Call does NOT execute files, it calls FUNCTIONS from dll files. it'll never work, unless you use a windows api function with system::call that runs batches, like ShellExecute.<br />
      but this is unnecessary, as you already have a script command available for this.<br />
      <br />
      for executing files use Exec, ExecWait, ExecShell and nsExec.<br />

      would you happen to know the syntax for ShellExecute?<br />
      <br />
      I have tried using Exec, ExecWait, ExecShell and nsExec. The problem is that the application I am using to run the installs remotely, psexec, does not support networking.<br />
      <br />
      The only thing that I could think of would to be to trick windows into thinking that the user ran the necessary batch file, and not the install executable.<br />
