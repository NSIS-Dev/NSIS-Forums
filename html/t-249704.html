      <p class="post-content">It has the same flaw as mine sorry. I dont think I told everyone EVERYTHING that was going on (sorry). If some text is left in the textbox that was not meant to be entered, and you click next, the code detects that something different than what was last entered is in the textbox, and enters it in, and does Abort. Your sample has the same problem unfortunately. Clicking "Install" when there's something in the box enters it in.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why not add a button marked "Add Item" to the custom page? This would let your script handle these two cases:<br>
      <br>
      (1) User types some text in the box and clicks "Add Item" to add the text to the list and update the custom page to show the new list of items<br>
      <br>
      (2) User types some text in the box (by mistake) then clicks "Next" (or presses ENTER) but this text is _not_ added to the list and the next page appears<br>
      <br>
      You can use the standard InstallOptions2 NOTIFY feature to implement this "Add Item" button.<br>
      <br>
      At the moment I cannot see any other way to meet your two requirements:<br>
      <br>
      (A) The idea is that the textbox entry will be entered into the listbox below if the user presses enter after entering the text into the textbox.<br>
      <br>
      (B) If some text is left in the textbox that was not meant to be entered, and you click next, this text must not be added to the list</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is all well and good, but are you saying that you CAN meet requirement A?<br>
      " The idea is that the textbox entry will be entered into the listbox below if the user presses &gt;ENTER&lt; after entering the text into the textbox. "<br>
      It's ok if this is not possible. I actually like the idea of having an "add item" button. I very well may add this in because some people are not keyboard people. I wonder if there's an ongoing poll about that...<br>

      <p class="post-content">Well, yes, your example does do something like that. It does however enter whatever text is in the box (if any) when you click "Install".<br>
      InstallOptionsEx Beta 5 had some silly bugs (which I have no time to fix) so I'm not using it. If I wasn't working in team dev mode I would fix it.<br>
      I'm currently using a work-around for this problem. My installer by nature expects you to enter a minimum number of entries into the list box. If you've reached the limit and something is still in the textbox then it'll Abort the page.<br>
      <br>
      One way I was going to try was detecting a carriage return character in the textbox string and entering it into the listbox if so. However this won't work either because when you press enter in a multiline textbox it doesn't call the Next button like a non-multiline. Too bad too. It would have worked nicely. There seems to be some strange behavior when you specify WANTRETURN without MULTILINE or vese versa. The escape key no longer quits the installer. Does anybody know what's going on there? Perhaps I could use it to my advantage.</p>
