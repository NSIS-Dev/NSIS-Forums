It depends on the NSIS version the installer was built with, wheather or not NSIS was recompiled to build this installer (if it was and you don't have the original source it's almost impossible), and the compression type used.<br><br>If it was built with one of the NSIS 2 alphas/betas you might as well kiss your installer good bye because following all of the changes will take you even longer then writing the decompiler.<br><br>If the installer is corrupted it will be even harder.<br><br>There is no tool that does this currently, and I don't think anyone will ever make one. There was on long ago for version 1.42 if I remember correctly, it's no longer avaiable for downloading.<br><br>If you really want to give in the time of writing such a decompiler and know the exact version of NSIS and compression type used to make this installer I will help you, PM me.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
