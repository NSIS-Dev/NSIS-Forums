I create a start menu folder with icons to run each of these programs, and with Wizou's excellent "nsisStartMenu" plugin, I place these in my preferred order (as opposed to the default alphabetical order).<br><br>I also place a shortcut to this start menu folder on the user's desktop, but the order of the icons seen when this shortcut is opened is different to that seen in the (now correct) start menu folder. Despite deleting both this shortcut and the actual start menu folder at the start, some (presumably Windows) magic feature remembers the icon order from its previous setting.<br><br>I cannot find another reference to my package in the registry, and as I said, your suggested removal of the only key simply returns the start menu folder to alpha order, and does not affect the desktop shortcut at all.<br><br>Many thanks for persevering with this thread.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Animaether</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th May 2010 12:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I guess you're looking at an Explorer Folder View (list / icons / whatever), and you want to change the order therein?<br>Although I'm guessing it should be possible, it's at least contingent upon the "remember each folder's view settings" setting in Explorer for that to work.

If a very specific order of programs is desired, perhaps a front-end launcher should be programmed instead (or an HTML file if lazy), as even if you do manage to set the order, it only takes the user a few clicks to change that order around again (if it doesn't happen randomly as it is).</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
