It popped up a DOS window and in that window a message similar to the subject appeared. Also, the icon for the installer exe file is not the same, but is the default exe icon.<br><br>This is with the latest version of NSIS downloaded yesturday. I have scanned the documentation for information specific to win98 or XP and friends but have seen nothing related to my problem. There also appears to be nothing listed in the forums.<br><br>What have I done wrong to cause this?<br><br>Thanks,<br>NR</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">nroberts</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th April 2003 21:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Not NSIS</strong><br>I found the problem, it was not caused by NSIS but by the method of transfer from one computer to another.

I am sure that if you move it back to the Windows XP machine it won't work there either. You should probably check your Windows 98 machine for viruses and the connection between the two computers. Just for the comparison, I have a Windows XP machine that I build my installers on and have no problem moving installers from it to my Windows 98 machine or any other machine. No icon is also a good indication of corrupted data, and so is the fact that it opens in a DOS box, which means Windows can't read the EXE headers right.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th April 2003 21:13 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Heh, OK :)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
