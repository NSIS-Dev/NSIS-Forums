      <p class="post-content"><strong>Uninstall with progress</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I want to uninstall an old version of my software before install new one. Everything works fine. But I run the uninstall in Silent mode to avoid that the user can skip the uninstall.<br />
      Now my question, is there a plugin or another way to show a small "task" window with a progressbar and the information about uninstalling so the user will see that something is going on? Most common "Setup solutions" have this I hope it is possible with NSIS, too.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Ocrana</p>

      <p class="post-content">I really don't think this is possible for an uninstaller that was already created, by an older installer.<br />
      <br />
      (From an NSIS perspective, obviously. Technically everything is possible in software, but yeah.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why it should not be possible? A marquee progressbar do not need any additional information but show the user that something is going on.<br />
      Iam just wondering that there are only two possible ways: Silent without any info and normal where the user can interact and stop the uninstall.</p>

      </blockquote>Because, as far as I know, there are no functions in standard NSIS uninstallers for requesting the uninstallation progress from an external process.

      I was able to create this behavior in my (un)installers by handling myself programmatically (in NSIS script) a command-line option /SHOWPROGRESS that would skip pages automatically (calling Abort in "PRE" functions)</p>

      </blockquote>Except that this would only work for new uninstallers. I think he wants to get progress numbers from an *existing* uninstaller. That would only be possible by hacking into the running process somehow, or hacking into the executable before it's executed.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: In which case it'd be better to copy the uninstall code to the new installer and call it as a function when required.

      <p class="post-content">Then one solution would be to display yourself a fake infinite progressbar (I hate those...) while the uninstaller is doing its job silently<br />

      <p class="post-content">Wizou, Iam wondering why you hate this. The main problem is, my uninstaller will stop a service, uninstall a driver and the files. This will need some time. I prefer a "fake" window instead of "No Responding" window cause the uninstaller runs in exec wait.<br />
      <br />
      I will try to make a solution. For the first "hack" the "Pre" idea is good. But I hate Buttons that I cannot click ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I prefer knowing how much I will have to wait ;-)<br />
      but if it's not possible, you're right, it's better to see a fake window (hence my suggestion)</p>
