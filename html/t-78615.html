      It's been out of development for some time as far as I can tell, but I really liked where it was going. A few more touch ups, and it would have been a great idea for controlling build types and such (I'd still use vim for all of my source editing).<br />
      <br />
      I hope some word comes of it.<br />
      <br />
      Or perhaps, anybody know another decent GUI?<br />

      </blockquote>Then just move the nsisplus/help.txt to nsisplus/data/help.txt.<br />
      The mentioned box appears every time you click on an item whose description is missing in help.txt; the V0.90 help.txt contains every command that is documentd in makensis.htm, so a description of "!define" is included and the box can only appear if the current help.txt was not loaded.<br />
      <br />
      I had a look at the source anyhow, and the box is gone now, because the fulltext search is very fast and for that it is now performed w/o asking the user.

      A submenu that lists your configurations, so you can, for example, go to Project -&gt; Set Active Configuration and it lists your configurations in a menu there, so you don't have to go into the project settings to change it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, saving a mouse click. :) But when you have twenty different versions to build, that's 20 mouse clicks, plus the time to make them all and such.<br />
      <br />
      Using different builds of NSIS is good because I have custom versions of it. For example, right now, I have the standard build, the bz2 build, and two other builds that I use for various software distributions that don't have some of the features compiled into them that I never use, so that it makes my software distribution smaller. Being able to set which one I use (so I don't have to always use the default or bz2, which are both bigger than I need to use.<br />

        <b>Speaking of NSISPlus... when is that new version going to be posted?</b>
      </blockquote>Nobody has asked for it :)<br />
      Here is the update: many details changes, e.g. support for autorun.inf files, doubleclicking error messages of makeNSIS, "compile all", custom compilers, version copying configurable for every single VS-Project entry.

      The fact is tat i'm a french translator, and wanna know if you planed to add to nsisplus any translation facilities or if we could mail to discuss about a french translation ! As you do not publish your mail, mine is <a href="mailto:veekee@fr.st">veekee@fr.st</a> ;) !<br />
      <br />
      One bug found lol ! When using /nocustom, this is considered as a normal type !<br />

      Typo<br />
      <br />
      In Edit Entry $ to Select Symbol box.<br />
      <br />
      Options OK and 'Abbrechen' (I presume German for Cancel or as the Google on translator says 'break off' :) )<br />
      <br />
      (Edit<br />
      <br />
      I do not know if it is a bug or not as I am new to NSIS and your bit of software but double clicking on InstallDir to get up edit entry. It says<br />
      Statement:<br />
      InstallDir &lt;and then the install directory you want&gt;<br />
      <br />
      It should say (IMHO)<br />
      InstallDir:<br />
      &lt;and the install directory you want.&gt;<br />
      <br />
      /End Edit)<br />
      <br />
      I hope it helps,<br />

      </blockquote>Well, I havent thought of this yet, since there where no reaction on NSISplus at all in this forum so far.<br />
      Most of the displayed text (online help, documentation) comes in ASCII form, so you should have no problems translating this; if you are willing to do this, I'll be happy to include you work in future updates of NSISplus.<br />

      Can you explain more precisely what you want to say? "/nocustom" is a switch for the InstallType command and therefore handled by makeNSIS, so where is the problem with NSISplus?<br />

      <p class="post-content">What about the ASCII texts tou're talking about .. in the final exe, i have to use hex editors to translate them ! The problem is that i have to use as much bytes as you (and french words are longer than english ones ;) .... but smaller than german ones :D ) !<br />

      <p class="post-content">errr, i forgot one little (little) bug =) ! When using left panel, i can activate or inactivate the InstType options... If i select on the left a section, this is activate, even if the cursor on the right panel is on Strings or Switches. By the way, if i select on the left a String, InstTyp can't be changed, even if i select on the right a section ! I mean, selecting a line on the right do not change the left panel, although selecting on the left is changing the right side !<br />

      </blockquote>As I said, most of the text to translate is the online help (data/help.txt) and the docu (nsisplus.html)<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>In the next version you will get all the text used by menus, dialogues, MessageBoxes etc. in a separate ASCII file, which will enable you to translate all the text once (instead of re translate all the resouces for every update).<br />
      Most of the code needed for this new feature is already implemented :)<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        I mean tat it is possible to tell NSISplus that this section belongs to InstType /NoCustom ;)

      </blockquote>Thats correct, the project tree adjusts the other views but will be (nearly) never adjusted by other views.<br />
      Visual Studio does it the same way.
