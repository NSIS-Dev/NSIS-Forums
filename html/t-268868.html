You both hit on a couple of my problems. I really wanted to use 7zip originally, but the exe stub doesn't allow you to choose an output directory, it just writes to a random folder in the temp directory. I could attach a script that writes it to the correct directory in Program Files, but that's messy, and this will be executed on a limited user account so that is just a bad idea. I also need a free solution, so WinRAR is out.<br><br>I am also trying to keep this trimmed to a few support files, and not have the creator have to install NSIS to use it (I currently have Zip2EXE in a folder with all of it's support files, stripping out the unnecessary NSIS files, and ended up with a lightweight 750Kb folder.)<br><br>Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm really suprised that there are no command line arguments in Zip2exe! If I'm the only person to ever ask for them it's pretty obvious why it's never been done, though...<br><br>If anyone knows of another program that does what zip2exe does in a relatively streamlined fashion AND allows for command-line arguments, please chime in!<br><br>Thanx again, everyone!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th April 2007 20:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>I am also trying to keep this trimmed to a few support files, and not have the creator have to install NSIS to use it (I currently have Zip2EXE in a folder with all of it's support files, stripping out the unnecessary NSIS files, and ended up with a lightweight 750Kb folder.)</blockquote>Then you don't need zip2exe, you just need makensis.exe. zip2exe uses makensis.exe, so when trying to keep things trimmed, it's dead weight. Create a batch file that'd use 7za.exe to extract files and run makensis.exe to compile a script you wrote.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">skewltek</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th April 2007 20:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">OH, so Zip2EXE is just a gui frontend for makensis.exe?!?
