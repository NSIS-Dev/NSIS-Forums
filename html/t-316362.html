Sometime the user may want to cancel an install part of the way through. Unfortunately, when the installer runs through the install process, the 'Cancel' button is grayed out and can not be used. Is there a way to reactivate it? So the use can put the breaks on the installer and run the uninstall method?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th January 2010 16:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Nope.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">CrushBug</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th January 2010 16:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I don't believe there is a way with embedded files in a stock installer.<br><br>Our larger installers are based out of external RAR files, so we have written a plug-in that handles the un-RARing as well as re-enabling the Cancel button and handling it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">directedition</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th January 2010 19:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">May I take a look at your plugin?

I probably can't release it in its current state, but it might be something we can do later.<br><br>I can probably answer some questions via private messages about it, if you want some hints at how we did it.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
