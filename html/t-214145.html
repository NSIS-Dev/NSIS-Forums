Either fixed or dynamic. Fixed could be set like</p><pre>
<code>MUI_SIZE '780x540'</code>
</pre>Dynamic well, I wouldn't worry too much about :)<br><br>All screens on the installer regardless of size will always have the same header and footer height. The header and footer will also remain at the top and bottom of the installer. This being the case NSIS should really have no worry in the world about things being out of place as long as the header and footer stretch width wise without problems.<br><br>Other screens like license and readme benefit greatly from this as they seem to be cramped even with an agree button. Also, new custom screens can be made, and lengthy form type screens can be better shortened and better organized with greater screen real estate. I really can't see how an amazing application like NSIS can't at least try to offer a native option on this...<br><br>If it's hard, how hard can it really be?

The MUI can add some defines line MUI_LARGER_UI and MUI_SMALLER_UI which will use those UIs. There is no need for new commands for set sizes.<br><br>A lot of things will take only a couple of hours. It's on my todo but so are a lot of other things. You can create a feature request so others will also see it. Someone might want to implement it, though I doubt it.
