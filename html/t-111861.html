      <p class="post-content"><strong>RMDir not working as expected</strong><br />
      I did some searches to try to find an answer to a problem that I was having, but no luck.<br />
      <br />
      I want to conditionally delete an installtion directory if and only if it's empty. IfFileExists does not work well for me, because .. and . are returned and the directories are not deleted, although empty.<br />
      <br />
      I saw a tip saying to just use RMDir, and it will delete if the directory is empty. However, on my version (1.98) it is deleting everything in SUBDIRECTORIES and the directory itself.<br />
      <br />
      How do I get out of this mess? Thanks in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, that's what threw me. I have some occurences of other included files with RMDirs. I'm going to double check that there are no /r switches, btu I don't think there are.<br />
      <br />
      If I'm the only one that's noticed this, it must be user error.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yup. My Bad. An include file was doing it. I will be very careful with /r in the future.<br />
      <br />
      As a side note, it would be an excellent idea to document the behavior of the RMDir command (/ifempty is the default). Besides it was not immediately apparent that the "recursive" terminology meant that unempty folders (especially root) would be deleted.<br />
      <br />
      Here's the Windows RMDir help, which states this behavior. You command is analogous, but the docs don't mention the file deletions.<br />
      <br />
      RMDIR [/S] [/Q] [drive:]path<br />
      RD [/S] [/Q] [drive:]path<br />
      <br />
      /S Removes all directories and files in the specified directory<br />
      in addition to the directory itself. Used to remove a directory<br />
      tree.</p>
