My installer must create a shortcut to a file that does not yet exist. further more, the directory which eventually contains the file CANNOT exist after the installation. currently i am attempting to achieve this behaviour with the following script:</p><pre>
<code>SetOutPath "$INSTDIR\webapps\xxx\WEB-INF"<br>CreateShortCut "$SMPROGRAMS\XXX Documents\Export or Import Database.lnk" \<br>  "$INSTDIR\webapps\xxx\WEB-INF\guiexportimport.bat" \ <br>  "" \<br>  "$INSTDIR\xxx.ico" 0 SW_SHOWNORMAL<br>; Remove directory created by SetOutPath<br>RMDir /r "$INSTDIR\webapps\xxx"</code>
</pre>problem is the RMDir has no effect and the xxx directory still exists after the installation has completed. (the WEB-INF dir under xxx also exists). does anyone know what i am doing wrong?

      <p class="post-content">Are you saying the shortcut is actually being created? (that would really surprise me, especially when you say that you must create a shortcut to file that does not exist.)<br>
      <br>
      Assuming that the target really does exist (and that you have sufficiet rights to the shortcut directory), then as a test, I'd try to insert some "IfErrors" commands after the CreateShortcut and RMDir commands to see if either is returning an error.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, the shortcut was being created, even though the file did not exist (i agree the documentation says it shouldn't have been created).<br>
      <br>
      i was originally using 2.04 and i have just tested the script (unchanged) with 2.05 and 2.0<br>
      2.04 &gt; problem<br>
      2.05 &gt; problem<br>
      2.0 &gt; no problem<br>
      <br>
      so the bug was arose due to upgrade from 2.0 to 2.04. is this a regression?<br>
      <br>
      today was the first time i ran the script but the guy who wrote it was using 2.0 so that explains why it only just appeared.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is not a bug. Windows not allows to delete current folder of applications. Following works on my comp<br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>SetOutPath "$INSTDIR\webapps\xxx\WEB-INF"<br>; ...<br>SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br>RMDir /r "$INSTDIR\webapps\xxx"<br></code>

      NSIS approach to "outpath" might be changed in later versions.
