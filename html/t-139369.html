      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to confirm a password in an INI to another field?</strong><br />
      &nbsp; Hello,<br />
      <br />
      I have several fields in an INI in which two are password fields. One field should validate against the other and this is the kind of idea I have...<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>[Field 9]<br />ValidateText=[Field 10]<br /><br />[Field 10]<br />ValidateText=[Field 9]</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      This is obviously not the case at trial. I have checked this page but believe its a little more complicated than it should be. <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=87" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/....php?pageid=87</a><br />
      <br />
      I also checked the test.nsi script but that is far off from trying to simply validate one field in an INI to another.<br />
      <br />
      Is this simple? I tried it with and without the square brackets "[]" but I cannot get one field to validate against another... Can someone please help?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you

      <p class="post-content">omg :p<br />
      <br />
      You are missing the labels to jump after "StrCmp"<br />

      <font color="blue">Usage: StrCmp str1 str2 label_to_goto_if_equal [label_to_goto_if_not]</font><br />
      <br />
      so you need to do something like that:<br />
      <br />
      ReadINIStr $0 "$PLUGINSDIR\UserProfile.ini" "Field 9" "State"<br />
      ReadINIStr $1 "$PLUGINSDIR\UserProfile.ini" "Field 10" "State"<br />
      <br />
      StrCmp $0 $1 Label_PassOK Label_PassNotOK<br />
      <br />
      Label_PassOK:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK "Password is OK."<br />
      ; Do other things here if needed<br />
      goto Label_EndOfTestPassword<br />
      <br />
      Label_PassNotOK:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK "Password is WRONG!"<br />
      ; Do other things here if needed<br />

      <br />
      It works and definitely so very appreciated but can I ask just two questions?<br />
      <br />
      1. How do I get rid of the OK box when the password is right? In other words, if the passwords are correct they simply go ahead with no prompts?<br />
      <br />
      2. When a user hits cancel, how can I avoid prompting them all together? Right now if pass words are wrong and a user hits cancel they can go through a little mean loop...<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise, this really works great, just curious about the other two questions.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you very much :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I got the first part going so far (Sorry for asking early). The user continues with no prompts of the password is correct. I simply removed the "MessageBox MB_OK "Password is OK." from the "Label_PassOK:"<br />

      Very cool indeed, now just how to avoid the password prompt when a user hits cancel?<br />

      <p class="post-content">For the first question just remove the line:</p>
      <pre>

MessageBox MB_OK "Password is OK."

      Sometimes I do in fact jump the gun :eek:<br />
      <br />
      How do I kill the wrong password prompt if a user clicks cancel? If it is too much trouble its cool as I was thinking of entering this as the Message Box label...<br />
      <br />
      "I would really like to continue ahead with your order but unfortunately your passwords do not match. Please fix them and I'll stay quiet."<br />
      <br />
      Cool?<br />

      Define custom page like this:</p>

      When I did that I was prompted with Password is Wrong... I hit ok on the message box and hit cancel on the installer again... I was faced with another messagebox... I corrected the passwords and hit cancel but the password scheme didn't like that and said my passwords were wrong...<br />
      <br />
      The only way around it was to fix the passwords, hit next and then hit cancel.<br />

      I am working with your newest one now but not sure why to implement a new custom page as I have it already nested into a custom page function...<br />

      As so not to make this confusing I've decided to leave it as is. What are the chances someone gets the password wrong, hits next, hits OK on the prompt and then wants to cancel?<br />
      <br />
      I've inserted this message which I think defines pretty much to the user what must happen if they get caught in the loop.<br />
      <br />
      "Passwords Must Match Before Continuing or Quitting This Application."<br />
      <br />
      I think it is straightforward enough even for those who do not understand the concept of just add water... I hope :)<br />
      <br />
      Thank you Vytautas for everything, I am so far very satisified with it.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Thank you Vytautas,<br />
      <br />
      Here is a very clean example of how I have it already setup.<br />
      <br />
      If passwords match, the user moves ahead with no prompt. If the users passwords do not match, the user is prompted and sent back to the initial page (this is the preferred method).<br />
      <br />
      If the user gets their passwords wrong and hits next their prompted. But if the user selects cancel to exit the user is sent back to the initial page and is caught in a loop.<br />
      <br />
      The only way the user can escape the loop is if the user makes the passwords match and hits next as cancel will sort of reset the password fields to their initial values and make the passwords wrong again.<br />
      <br />
      Its a little tricky and I appreciate you looking at it a little further. Thank you for your time Vytautas.</p>

      ReadINIStr $0 "$PLUGINSDIRUserProfile.ini" "Field 9" "State"<br />
      ReadINIStr $1 "$PLUGINSDIRUserProfile.ini" "Field 10" "State"<br />

      ReadINIStr $1 "$PLUGINSDIR\UserProfile.ini" "Field 10" "State"<br />

      I did that and it works beatifully... I will let you know of any errors I find if any. I hope not, it looks awesome :)<br />
