Trust me, I went through the manual a dozen times, but couldn't find anything. Everything I found implied that SetDetailsPrint was the way to do logging, not downloading a specialized build and using LogText. Heck, if you type "logging" into the NSIS User Manual, LogSet never even comes up! I still don't even understand what <i>SetDetailsPrint both</i> is supposed to do.<br><br>Unfortunately, the output generated by LogText seems to be too verbose for my needs. I use the XML library which seems to generate about 300 "Jump: 224". Plus, I want to have a log file for install and un-install. I will probably just roll my own macro that writes to a file.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">LoRd_MuldeR</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th July 2008 16:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">DetailPrint will write a line to the installer screen, that's the listbox the user will see during install. You can make the text appear right over the listbox only (textonly), you can add a new line to the listbox only (listonly), or you can add a line to listbox *plus* make that new line appear right over the listbox (both). Note that the text label right over the listbox will *always* be visible, while the listbox itself is hidden unless the user clicks "Show Details".

This back and forth actually got me to a point I'm happy. I hadn't set <i>AutoCloseWindow false</i>, so my install/un-install messages weren't being displayed to the user long enough to be useful. I think I'm going to put everything useful into that window for now. Work on persisting the information another day.<br><br>Thanks again for the help.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
