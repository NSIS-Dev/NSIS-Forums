Of course an installer <i>could</i> implement that with custom code: Simply check for a certain commandline argument, e.g. /NOSHORTCUTS, and skipt creating shortcuts if found. But a "normal" installer won't offer an option like that...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Stander</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd September 2008 10:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hi guys!<br><br>I was looking for the same solution.<br>I also want to run a silent install of another setup and define the place where the program should be installed.<br>The only difference is that I want the program to be installed in the same main directory as a user chooses for my own application.<br>For example: a user chooses to install my application in "E:\Program files\MyApp" so I want the external program to be also installed in "E:\Program files\ExtApp"<br><br>Thank you for your advices.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pbingel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd September 2008 15:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">It seems that you might need to provide more details of what applications you are trying to install.

Basically you need some way of retrieving the install directory of MyApp. Are you planning on embedding the installation of ExtApp in the installation of MyApp? If so this might work. At some point in your script $INSTDIR should be set during the installation of MyApp. Use a message box to print it out after the installation of MyApp<br>MessageBox MB_OK "$INSTDIR". If the directory is correct,in the same script after the installation of MyApp completes you can modify the code that LoRd_MuldeR provided to install ExtApp.<br><br>...Sorry if my answer seems rushed or unorganized buts its 5pm here time to go home!!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Stander</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd September 2008 22:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks pbingel.<br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by pbingel</i><br>Are you planning on embedding the installation of ExtApp in the installation of MyApp?</blockquote>Yes.<br><br><blockquote><i>Originally posted by pbingel</i><br>If the directory is correct,in the same script after the installation of MyApp completes you can modify the code that LoRd_MuldeR provided to install ExtApp.</blockquote>I tried to use the code provided by LoRd_MuldeR. Using this code ExtApp has been installed into MyApp installation directory. So all files from ExtApp went to MyApp install dir.<br>The result I want to get is to install both applications in separate directories but in the same main directory (but dependently on what main directory is chosen by a user).<br>For example:<br>When installing MyApp a user chooses<br><b>C:\Program files\</b>MyApp<br>as the place where he wants to install MyApp<br><br>So I want ExtApp to go to:<br><b>C:\Program files\</b>ExtApp<br><br><blockquote>...Sorry if my answer seems rushed or unorganized buts its 5pm here time to go home!!
