      <p class="post-content"><strong>String terminated with 2 NULLs</strong><br />
      Hello. I'm creating an installer for my WinAmp plugin. One of the things I need to do is write a REG_MULTI_SZ string to the registry, and I was able to do this, but I'm concerned I'm hiding a potential bug.<br />
      <br />
      The problem is the string that I pass into the call is NULL terminated, but the MSDN docs for RegSetKeyValueA require me to have <i>two</i> NULLs at the end of the string to signify the actual end of the buffer.<br />
      <br />
      I can't figure out how to create such a string - the NSIS parser doesn't seem to support '\0' as an escape character.<br />
      <br />
      For now, I'm telling RegSetKeyValueA that my buffer is one byte bigger than it actually is, and this happens to work because a second NULL happens to follow my NULL terminated string, but that is just luck and I figure sometime somewhere this will fail.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way to embed additional NULLs in my string? Is there a way to define my string as a hex array?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Brian</p>

      <p class="post-content">1. I think if you call the instructions provided by NSIS to write a string to the registry (e.g. WriteRegStr or WriteRegExpandStr), NSIS will automatically append the required NULL chars, so you don't need to pass them explicitly.<br />
      <br />
      2. You can call WriteRegBin to write a block of binary data to the registry. This data has to be provided as a hexadecimal string.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the info. I assume WriteRegStr, WriteRegExpandStr, and WriteRegBin create values of type REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, and REG_BINARY respectively.<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, I need the resulting value to be of type REG_MULTI_SZ because the application that will act on these values will fail if the type isn't correct.<br />

      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the link! It looks like that will solve the problem, but I'm going to try to solve it without requiring another DLL.<br />
      <br />
      It looks like NSIS zeros out local buffers of a larger size than what you request before each use, so I'm probably safe as is, but I'm going to use a silly trick as a 'just-in-case'.<br />
      <br />
      I StrCpy a 40 byte string to $8 in one call (so the 40th element will be NULL terminated), then use a 2nd StrCpy to copy in a 39 byte string to $8 (so now the 39th and 40th elements are now NULL).<br />
      <br />
      It works, but again, I think NSIS is solving my problem and my silly trick is redundant.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">this is undefined behavior (could change at any time)<br />
      <br />
      The proper way to do this would be to use the system plugin (allocate a structure, and call the registry)</p>
