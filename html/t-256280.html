Basically, the user has selected a certain install configuration at the components page which enables them to use their own file in the installation progress, and I want to be able to prompt them for that file's location to be able to use it.<br>Right now I've basically told the user, with a messagebox, to place the file (named exactly a certain name) on the Desktop so I can pick it up. Of course, as you can imagine, this isn't very friendly and could be a lot better using a prompt.<br><br>I've searched extensively (well, at least, I'd like to think so) and haven't found anything on the matter, so I was wondering if anybody around here has some method to do this.<br>Thanks in advance.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th September 2006 19:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Did you search on <b>PageEx</b> instruction or <b>Dialogs</b> &amp; <b>DialogEx</b> plugins</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Taake</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th September 2006 23:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">PageEx wouldn't work, as this can only happen inside a section (unless I use SectionGetFlags I guess).
