To clarify what crashes is the NSIS compiler, and no installer EXE file is output<br><br>even when the installer is created it isn't always reliable. I have some checks for 64 bit windows using x64.nsh. My old installer was fine with it, now the same installer with the new payload can't recognize 64 bit windows unless it's run from an elevated process (!)<br><br>what is the cause of this randomness?<br>where can i get the latest version of UPX.EXE?<br><br>thanks<br>nikos</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th October 2009 12:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Which version of NSIS?

      when I !define WIN64 the installer doesn't detect 64 bit windows so I just get a messagebox saying that "this is the 64 bit installer please get the 32 bit version..." which means that

      any tips?<br>

      <p class="post-content">Try this instead, I have a headache following that. !ifdef is a compiler command, not a runtime command. I only tested on Vista and XP 32-bit and the 64-bit program installer is able to detect that I'm not running X64 without elevated privileges. As expected when I tried to install 64-bit xplorerÂ² on 32-bit it blocked installation.<br>
      <br></p>
      <pre>

</pre>I hope that is what you're looking for. You may also want something like this:<br>
      <br>
      !ifdef WIN64<br>
      OutFile "xplorer2-64bit.exe"<br>
      !else<br>
      OutFile "xplorer2-32bit.exe"<br>
      !endif<br>
      <br>
      Also, from x64.nsh on redirection:<br>

      <blockquote>
        ; DisableX64FSRedirection disables file system redirection.<br>
        ; EnableX64FSRedirection enables file system redirection.<br>
        ;<br>
        ; SetOutPath $SYSDIR<br>
        ; ${DisableX64FSRedirection}<br>
        ; File some.dll # extracts to C:\Windows\System32<br>
        ; ${EnableX64FSRedirection}<br>
        ; File some.dll # extracts to C:\Windows\SysWOW64<br>

      <p class="post-content">I tried this "inside out" approach but it fails all the same<br>
      <br>
      the weird thing is that if people run the installer from the desktop it fails, but if they open a 64 bit browser like xplorer2 and run the installer from in there there are no problems whatsoever</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd ask to see the entire script, but that might not be possible.. and inquire if you are using some stripped/butchered version of Windows (such as with nLite or vLite) or might have any programs running, usually security programs, that might be causing the behavior.<br>
      <br>
      And I don't see any upx.exe included with NSIS, have you tried it without using UPX at all?</p>

      it looks like the +4 jump didn't count comment lines (where's that documented?) so I removed the +4 and introduced a label instead and all is well (!)

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>It is documented in the "Relative Jumps" section in the manual: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.4" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.4</a><br>
      <br>
      Note that relative jumps specify the number of INSTRUCTIONS to jump not the number of lines in your script (see the manual for details). Note also the part where the manual mentions using "macro insertion" and relative jumps.

      <p class="post-content">right, so it _is_ documented but very confusing regardless. Half the statements you use in the script are counted in jumps and half not? What a derranged concept!? :)<br>
      <br>
      now i'm going to have to double check 1000 lines of installer code to double check what other jumps have gone wrong like that :(<br>
      <br>
      thanks for clearing this up</p>
