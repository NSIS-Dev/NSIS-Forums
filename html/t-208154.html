      <p class="post-content"><strong>my extensions for UserInfo plugin</strong><br />
      Hey guys!<br />
      <br />
      I must have the possibility to create a new user in my installer, as well as setting up some user rights / privileges for this user.<br />
      <br />
      I put a few new functions into the UserInfo plugin and it seems to work just fine. Here's the list of functions I added to UserInfo:<br />
      <br />
      - CreateAccount USER_ID PASSWORD COMMENT<br />
      Adds a user account with the given password and comment to the local system<br />
      <br />
      - DeleteAccount USER_ID<br />
      Removes the given user account from the system<br />
      <br />
      - AddPrivilege USER_ID PRIVILEGE<br />
      Adds a privilege to the given user, e.g. SeServiceLogonRight or SeSetSystemTime etc.<br />
      <br />
      - RemovePrivilege USER_ID PRIVILEGE<br />
      Removes a privilege from a user account<br />
      <br />
      Now I would like to add a number of group related functions and would like to add:<br />
      <br />
      - CreateGroup GROUP_ID COMMENT<br />
      Create a new group<br />
      <br />
      - DeleteGroup GROUP_ID<br />
      Deletes a group<br />
      <br />
      - AddToGroup USER_ID GROUP_ID<br />
      Adds the user to the given group<br />
      <br />
      - RemoveFromGroup USER_ID GROUP_ID<br />
      Removes the user from the given group<br />
      <br />
      I have difficulties with the group name, which has to be passed to almost all NETAPI functions as a LPCWSTR (Unicode). I am using the same conversions I did with the user related functions, but I get constant errors. If any Visual C++ freak out there with experiences regarding Unicode string handling can help me, please send me a PM.<br />
      <br />
      And: I would like to know if I should submit my hacked UserInfo plugin? Who has to receive it in which format? (I could zip the UserInfo folder in my NSIS contrib dir, that's where I am actually developing).<br />
      <br />
      Is this of any interest to somebody?<br />
      <br />
      Kind regards,<br />
      Heiko</p>

      <p class="post-content">AccessControl is already able to change user access to objects. There are also some users currently working on improving it. I think it would be better if you apply your changes to the AccessControl plug-in. The UserInfo plug-in is just for information, not for access control.</p>

      </blockquote>The AccessControl plugin seems to be targeted against File and Registry access rights, I will probably better start a new plugin, maybe calling it UserManager or something like that...<br />
      <br />
      If anyone is interested in helping me with these damn unicode strings, I could send you a Zip file containing the project.<br />
      <br />
      At the moment, the features I need are working fine, so I already can use it for myself.<br />

      <p class="post-content">It might be targeted against file and registry, but it is still about AccessControl. Other than the concept, there are probably a lot of code that can be shared. It probably already handles Unicode strings... You could join forces with the users already working on it.</p>

      Your extension sounds like just what I need. All I need to do is create user accounts and set their privileges. This is required for a silent install of PostgreSQL 8.0. Have you posted your extension anywhere or can you post it here? Or has anyone else found anything that will acomplish this?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!<br />

      </blockquote>Hi, I am doing a silent postgresql install too and wandering if you managed to get this working using UserInfo. I am calling "net user" to create a service account but run into the problem when the account expires after XX days. There is no native net user/account to disable password expiry for a specific account.. Were you able to get around this issue?<br />
      <br />
      Cheers,<br />

      </blockquote>Hi Tao,<br />
      <br />
      sorry but I did not find out an easy way to accomplish this. Did you try to use my plugin to create that user account? As far as I can see it seems not to be affected by that problem, but I may be wrong as this could differ on different Windows flavours.<br />
      <br />

      Although net commands do not have the option of changing the 'expired' flag of a user account, you can use WMI do do it. Set a variable for the user name and call<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />nsExec::ExecToStack '$SYSDIR\Wbem\wmic.exe UserAccount Where Name="$YourUserAcount" Set PasswordExpires= FALSE'</code>
</pre><br />
      Other properties that can be changed in this way are<br />
      <pre>
<code><br />The following writeable properties are available:<br />Property                                Type                    Operation<br />========                                ====                    =========<br />Disabled                                boolean                 Read/Write<br />FullName                                string                  Read/Write<br />Lockout                                 boolean                 Read/Write<br />PasswordChangeable                      boolean                 Read/Write<br />PasswordExpires                         boolean                 Read/Write<br />PasswordRequired                        boolean                 Read/Write</code>
</pre><br />
      Not very elegant since it requires WMI, but a solution nonetheless.<br />
      <br />
      @hgerstung<br />
      My understanding is that it is possible to set the password to not expire using the netapi32 calls that the UserInfo plugin utilizes. If the user properties are defined using a USER_INFO_1 structure you can pass the UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD flag to the NetUserAdd function.<br />
