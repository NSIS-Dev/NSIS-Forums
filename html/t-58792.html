What I suggest is that you install it, but then run the uninstaller. But since you don't want to install it, then sorry.<br><br>2)For this you would need the original NSI Script File. If you recently reformatted your hard drive, then you are royally screwed.

So it installs it and makes a mock registry and mounted drive so any installer can be tested. Would that not work or would it be insanely hard to make a system like that?<br><br>I mean if microsoft can make a test env... (to buy for an insanely giant price) Then is it possible to make some sort of shell program to test applications in? If one already exists where could you get that? Many times I wanna use the files from installers and make a giant pack for system recoveries. This topic seemed to match my question so i might as well throw it out there.<br><br>I know this doesn't really make a pure script but ... if you know what the installer does in a controlled env then isn't that enough..<br><br>Oh, and by the way. There is new files being shared on p2p networks that pose as music packs (I don't think saying this is violating board rules...sorry if im incorrect) And its a giant exe that installs SAAP.exe and VX adware which will cripple your computer. I fell for that once :) and im usually smarter then that ... lol.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Brummelchen</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2005 02:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">read this !<br><a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=207610" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....hreadid=207610</a></p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
