Since the process takes a certain amount of time, I need to disable the 'Next', 'Back' and 'Cancel' buttons during the installation process.<br><br>At the moment, I am using ExecWait to call the Setup.exe which would perform the installation process for MSDE. At the same time, using the ebanner plugin, I would display a banner indicating to the user that MSDE is currently being installed. Once MSDE has been installed, the banner would be removed and user would be directed to the following custom page.<br><br>Although with the banner on, if user clicks on the 'Next' or 'Cancel' button several times, user would be directed to a few skipped custom pages or a message box will be displayed confirming cancellation of the installation process. This happens once MSDE has been installed.<br><br>To prevent this, I have used one of the examples from previous NSIS forum threads to disable the 'Next', 'Back' and 'Cancel' button during installation.<br><br>The code is something like this;<br><br>/* Disable the Back, Next and Cancel buttons */<br>GetDlgItem $R1 $HWNDPARENT 1<br>EnableWindow $R1 0<br><br>GetDlgItem $R2 $HWNDPARENT 2<br>EnableWindow $R2 0<br><br>GetDlgItem $R3 $HWNDPARENT 3<br>EnableWindow $R3 0<br><br>Once Installation of MSDE is complete,<br><br>/* Re-Enable the Back, Next and Cancel buttons (after installation) */<br>GetDlgItem $R1 $HWNDPARENT 1<br>EnableWindow $R1 1<br><br>GetDlgItem $R2 $HWNDPARENT 2<br>EnableWindow $R2 1<br><br>GetDlgItem $R3 $HWNDPARENT 3<br>EnableWindow $R3 1<br>FunctionEnd<br><br><br>Based on the codes above, during MSDE installation, these 'Next’,’ Back', and 'Cancel' buttons would be grayed out (disable). Once MSDE is installed, these buttons are re-enabled and user would be automatically directed to the following custom page.<br><br>However, during installation of MSDE, even if I click on any of these buttons, I would still get a response after MSDE is installed. This would be a BIG problem for me because if the user clicks on the grayed 'Next' button several times during MSDE installation, he would be skipped a few custom pages after installation of MSDE.<br><br>Is there anyway to really make sure that these 'Next’,’ Back', and 'Cancel' buttons are disabled and even if user clicks on them, there would be no return response after the MSDE installation process?<br><br>Truly grateful for any assistance on this issue.<br><br>Thanks a million!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">galil</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th July 2006 15:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You could simply use HideWindow/BringToFront to hide the installer window entirely during the process, and show only banner.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th July 2006 15:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You could try the ExecDos plugin with asynchronous execution.<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">baskaran.vishnu</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th July 2006 07:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hi,<br><br>Thanks Galil and Afrow for your replies.<br><br>Based on the excerpts from Galil;<br><br><b>"You could simply use HideWindow/BringToFront to hide the installer window entirely during the process, and show only banner."</b><br><br>I have tried to Hide the window, invoke the e-banner and then Bring to Front the installer window once the specific process has completed. However, when I hide the window, the Banner gets hidden as well.<br><br>The following is a sample code I have tried applying;<br><br>Function InstallMSDE<br><br>HideWindow<br>ebanner:show /NONUNLOAD /HALIGN=CENTRE /VALIGN=CENTRE /FIT=WIDTH "$PLUGINSDIR\MSDEBanner.gif"<br><br>SetOutPath "$TEMP\MSDE"<br>ExecWait 'setup.exe /qn INSTANCENAME="testsvr"' $0<br><br>BringToFront<br>ebanner:stop<br>FunctionEnd<br><br><br>I have even tried invoking the banner before the HideWindow command, the results are the same, both the banner and the installer window gets hidden.<br><br>I have previously considered using newadvsplash plugin, but the timer must be fixed and with MSDE installation timing not being consistent, I am not able to use the newadvsplash plugin. The AnimGif plugin did also get my consideration. However, I can't seem to get the plugin to work in my custom page function (It works in Func. OnInit)<br><br>Therefore, I feel at the moment, the e-banner seems ok for me. But based on the problem I highlighted in my initial posting and based on using the HideWindow command as an option, I can't seem to resolve my problem at the moment.<br><br>I have to simulate the ExecDos plugin as suggested by Afrow (I did read the plugin info, I am not sure if this would actually disable the Next,Back or Cancel buttons for good)<br><br><br>I would be extremely grateful for any support. Is there a way to Hide the Window using the HideWindow command and at the same time enable display of the e-banner while MSDE is being installed?<br><br><br>Thanks again!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">baskaran.vishnu</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th July 2006 12:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hi,<br><br>Based from my recent postings regarding this topic, I may have found an alternative to the disabling of the 'Next', 'Back' and 'Cancel' buttons.<br><br>At the moment, When I disable these buttons and perform some process (with a banner displayed indicating a currently ongoing process), users who click on the disabled (grayed out) 'Next', 'Back' or 'Cancel' would have the handles to these buttons saved and executed after the specific process has been executed. Hence, I were to click a disabled 'Next' 3 times, the installer would jump three pages after a specific process is complete, which is a problem here (Refer to my first posting in this topic for a full description).<br><br>A simplified sample example code is as shown below;<br><br>Page custom ShowMSDEPage InstallMSDEPage<br><br>Function ShowMSDEPage<br>!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_INITDIALOG "MSDEPage"<br>!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_SHOW<br>FunctionEnd<br><br>Function InstallMSDE<br>/* Disable the Next Back and Cancel buttons */<br>GetDlgItem $R1 $HWNDPARENT 1<br>EnableWindow $R1 0<br><br>GetDlgItem $R2 $HWNDPARENT 2<br>EnableWindow $R2 0<br><br>GetDlgItem $R3 $HWNDPARENT 3<br>EnableWindow $R3 0<br><br>ebanner:<br>SetOutPath "$TEMP/MSDE"<br>ExecWait 'setup.exe /qn INSTANCENAME="TESTSVR"' $0<br><br>FunctionEnd<br><br>From the codes above, during the execution of setup.exe, the Next, Back and Cancel buttons of the custom page is disabled. However, clicking on any of these disabled buttons saves and later executes these handles upon completion of the setup.exe process.<br><br>An alternative to this problem is to <b>add a message box after the operation of setup.exe, indicating a successful MSDE Installation.</b> In doing this, all the saved 'Next, Back / Cancel' handles are reset and the message box is displayed. Once user clicks OK to the message box, the subsequent custom page automatically loads, without executing the clicked Next, Back or Cancel handle buttons.<br><br>At the moment, having a message box after the execution a specific process prevents the handle of a disabled 'Next, Back or Cancel' buttons of instead being executed in the event user clicks on these disabled buttons.<br><br>I hope this might be helpful to others, though it is not a concrete solution.<br><br>If there are any other possible solutions, I am truly grateful for them.<br><br>Thanks</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">galil</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th July 2006 12:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well, I used Banner, not EBanner.
