By the way, every installer gets hacked once in a while and the protection of your program also depends (besides the installer) on the protection of the files that arise from the installer. It might be possible (when not protected properly) that people just copy some files to a CD or to another web-site to offer your program for free...<br><br>So, maybe Justin knows a way of dealing with this, or just to make it a bit harder for hackers :(<br><br>I mean, it might be possible to use PGP or some other algorithm to code the files in an installer... But this should be added to NSIS source... (by the way, PGP is free...)<br><br>Well, everyone, good luck with RegCode, ideas (about protection or RegCoding or...), questions,<br>please post them here...<br><br>Crish thx for the great response!!!<br><br>Greetz, Hendri.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Smile2Me</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd January 2002 09:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>just to be complete...</strong><br>Maybe I didn't mention, but just to be complete:<br><br>the page numbers used in .onNextPage and .onPrevPage are such that in a one-component installation, the question for RegCode appears just after the license agreement and the alternative .onVerifyInstDir is triggered just after clicking install (of course...:)).

Meaning if you want to retrive data, you had to give the developer your key to send you the file. The regcode idea is a good one, but with items like the NSIS browser from pjw, you can bipass that. The only thing is that if you program the original program to look for Registry Keys/INI files with the code.<br><br>Good Idea, but sorry :)<br>-Duane</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Smile2Me</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd January 2002 15:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Duane,<br><br>indeed, PGP cannot be used here properly, but I wanted to trigger some discussion on the best coder for this purpose...<br>So if anyone knows some free coder utility, please post it and maybe Justin will build it into NSIS 2.0 (or something...)<br><br>About the NSIS browser by PJW (???): Tell me about it, where can I find it?<br>I know some NSIS extractor:<br><a href="http://www.incomplete.co.uk/nsis.htm" target="_blank">http://www.incomplete.co.uk/nsis.htm</a><br><br>but that's only compatible to NSIS 1.5x or older...<br><br>Thx, greetz, Hendri.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pjw62</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd January 2002 19:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I shouldn't worry about decompiling or whatever.. any one who really wants to crack your program will take SoftICE to it.

I stopped being bothered to update it a while ago.
