<code>GetFunctionAddress $0 GetInstallPath<br>UAC::ExecCodeSegment $0</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      can be easily replaced with<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>!insertmacro UAC_AsUser_Call Function GetInstallPath ${UAC_SYNCREGISTERS}</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Without documentation, I am unsure what the .oninit code is supposed to be, the examples have a lot of stuff in them and not sure what is required. I'm currently using:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>!insertmacro UAC_PageElevation_OnInit<br>${If} ${UAC_IsInnerInstance}<br>${AndIfNot} ${UAC_IsAdmin}<br>        SetErrorLevel 0x666666 ;special return value for outer instance so it knows we did not have admin rights<br>        Quit<br>${EndIf}</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      I am unsure about the uninstaller (if it needs to be elevated?) and any UnLoad requirements. Still, it's a start, thanks! I'll fiddle around more to see whats needed

      <br>
      I'll have a go at making all these changes and see what happens.

      </blockquote>Of course you'll also need to *do* something with that 0x666666 return value you set. Use it after you call the self-elevation macro:<br>
      <br>
      !insertmacro UAC_RunElevated<br>
      ${If} $2 = 0x666666 ;our special return, the new process was not admin after all<br>
      MessageBox mb_iconExclamation "You need to login with an account that is a member of the admin group to continue..."<br>
      Abort<br>
      ${EndIf}

      <p class="post-content">Hurm, it seems to work well now, a few issues with the Uninstaller (But I haven't yet looked at that, I have a feeling I am doing stuff to admin that should be done to user)<br>
      <br>
      One issue is if you run the installer from (say) explorer, the Installer appears BEHIND any forms on the screen. I looked at:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>Function GuiInit<br>!insertmacro UAC_PageElevation_OnGuiInit<br>FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br>
      but wasn't too sure if this was the right direction. I also know BringToFront doesn't work on Vista/Win7 after MS changed it. Are there any recommendations?

      </blockquote>Yes I am, in fact I am doing the Elevation in the same way as the UAC_AdminOnly example, although my installer is using the MUI GUI stuff.<br>
      <br>
      I moved the elevation to a custom pre_ function of the first visible window and the forms now show up on top of everything.<br>
      <br>
      I have to run through some tests now (and uninstall the right stuff now), but otherwise it seems to be working nicely, thanks very much for the help everyone!
