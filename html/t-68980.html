      <p class="post-content"><strong>Getting the current date at install time</strong><br />
      :confused:<br />
      I am trying to write a shareware application and I need to get the current date on installation and record it. I have written a small C++ program that does this but I would prefer to get the installer to do it. Is there anyway to get the current date on installation? or is it possible to write a C++ program that can be run using ExecWait that returns the date?</p>

      <p class="post-content">At the moment you can't get the current date from NSIS. But it's possible to write your own little NSIS extension dll for that. There is an example in Contrib/ExDLL, in Contrib/NSISdl and my extension for executing mci commands stays <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=418131" target="_blank">here</a> :).<br />

      <p class="post-content">How about this (requires NSIS 1.90+, though with a little modification you can make it work in earlier versions):<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />GetTempFileName $R0 ; creates a file, assigns name to $R0<br />GetFileTime $R0 $R1 $R2<br />Delete $R0<br />; $R1 is high dword of current time<br />; $R2 is low dword of current time<br /></code>
</pre><br />

      <p class="post-content">thanks Justin - my first thought was to get the creation time for the .exe file but that wasn't working because I stuffed my C++ code up. I thought that there was something wrong with the way I was using the NSIS GetFileTime function but when I saw that you used it in your post I went back over it and realised my application's code was stuffed.<br />

      I tried your solution too F. Heidenreich but it wouldn't compile - it came up with the dreaded "LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _main" error. I did it as a Win32 Dynamic Link Library project in Visual C++ 6 so I don't understand why it wouldn't accept _DLLMainCRTStartup instead. I also found that exdll didn't compile either - it had the same link error.However your extension (nsisext_mci) compiled and linked perfectly. Has anyone else encountered this error using Visual C++ 6 to compile exdll or any extension of their own making?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The solution for the linker prob is to enable the checkbox 'Project-&gt;Settings-&gt;Linker-&gt;General-&gt;Ignore all default libraries'.<br />
      <br />
      If you get the 'error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __chkesp', remove the /GZ from the compiler switches.<br />

      <p class="post-content">To Help anyone else who has a similar problem: :)<br />
      Here's the code I used with NSIS version 1.81. The date is stored in $R1 and $R2 and these values can be written to the registry or a file or whatever. The 2 variables $R1 and $R2 form the 2 variables of a win32 FILETIME structure.Create a FILETIME structure in your C++ program and initialize it with the values of these 2 variables (wherever you stored them). The FILETIME struct can then be manipulated to turn it into a SYSTEMTIME structure or a CTime object.<br />
      <br />
      ;get current time by creating a temp file and reading it's time stamp<br />
      ;make a new file in the temp directory<br />
      SetOutPath "$TEMP"<br />
      File "new file"<br />
      SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"<br />
      ;get it's time stamp<br />
      GetFileTime "$TEMP\new file" $R1 $R2<br />
      ; $R1 is high dword of current time<br />
      ; $R2 is low dword of current time<br />
      ;delete our new file (it's purpose has been served)<br />
      Delete "$TEMP\new file"</p>
