      <p class="post-content"><strong>User editable install directory - help!</strong><br />
      From the subject you would assume I'm an idiot - but let's assume I'm not for a minute.<br />
      <br />
      This installer is for a map pack which must be placed in a very specific directory to function. I found some code to extract the correct directory from the registry/filesystem, but it only functions inside of "section" and thus I cannot use "Page directory" to let people edit the directory if it happens to be wrong.<br />
      <br />
      <b>My question is: Is there a way to allow a user to modify a variable created inside of "Section," and if so, how can I do this?</b><br />
      <br />
      Any help would be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I tried that, but unfortunately the install directory doesn't auto-populate with the supposed-correct directory... which is bad.<br />
      <br />
      I'm unfortunately very new to NSIS and will probably be fighting with this until I give up and just don't use an installer... lol. This thing has been driving me nuts for weeks.</p>

      </blockquote>...What does that mean, exactly? If you StrCpy $INSTDIR in .onInit, the directory page will enter that value into the path field as the default. Unless you change the contents of $INSTDIR again at a later time.

      <p class="post-content">looks like you've got the code to copy the dynamic Steam Account-generated folder to $INSTDIR in your section? you should put that StrCpy in .onInit after calling - and verifying the output from - Call GetSteamAccountName. ( actually, after the "gogogo:" label - no point in doing any code that may not actually get used.</p>
