      <p class="post-content"><strong>copying files from compiled EXE</strong><br />
      Searched the forum and can't find a solution/suggestion for my very basic NEWB issue.<br />
      <br />
      Can't get NSIS to copy 3 files that are added into the<br />
      EXE file at time of compile.<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />File "Mapifix.exe"<br />File "ETSTempfix.exe"<br />File "ETS Temp fix.bat"<br />CopyFiles "$EXEDIR\ETSTempFix.exe" "$INSTDIR\ETSTempfix.exe"<br />CopyFiles "$EXEDIR\Mapifix.exe" "$INSTDIR\Mapifix.exe"<br />CopyFiles "$EXEDIR\ETS Temp Fix.bat" "$INSTDIR\ETS Temp fix.bat"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Do I have to define the EXEDIR? Isn't that predefined variable which means the files are part of the compiled EXE?<br />
      <br />
      Any assistance would be appreciated.. I'm not understanding the User Manual when it comes to copying files from the EXE

      <p class="post-content">Your installer extracts files to the destination machine. You've done this with "File." CopyFiles is for copying files from one spot on the destination machine to another, which I don't think you want to do in this case.<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />File "Mapifix.exe"<br />File "ETSTempfix.exe"<br />File "ETS Temp fix.bat"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      Try running that (assuming those 3 files are in the same directory on your computer as your script--if not, enter their full paths). You'll see those files in are now on the destination machine in $INSTDIR. So you had the right code...you were just trying to do an extra step that's not necessary.

      <p class="post-content">OK... now I'm not getting the copied failed errors..thank you<br />
      but no files were copied into the Directory<br />
      The directory is there.. but empty.<br />
      <br />
      The 3 files are in the same directory as the script..but how do I know they were added to the EXE when it was compiled?<br />
      <br />
      I searched the user manual.. but can't find the command to ensure they are added to the EXE.. so I think my EXE doesn't have the 3 files compressed into it.<br />
      <br />
      Do I need to put something in the "Function .onInit" command?</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want to test your script, then why don't you try setting the OutPath to a <b><u>different</u></b> folder than your script? Otherwise, how are you going to know that anything actually happened?<br />
      <br />
      Also:<br />
      The compiler does a pretty good job of complaining if there are any errors adding files to your EXE. If there were any problems, compiling will stop.<br />
      <br />
      And if you look closely at the compiler's log, you'll see where each file was added. It will look something like this:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />File: "example1.nsi" [compress] 388/831 bytes<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      If you need more help, I suggest you look at some of the examples included with NSIS. (The compiler example above came from the EXAMPLE1.NSI script located in the NSIS install folder.)
