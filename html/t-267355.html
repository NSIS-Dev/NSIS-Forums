      <br />
      let me tell more info about my script..<br />
      <br />
      i not use code on the section because i dont want to show the default installer. I only want to show the final banner "installation succesfull", because my installers are not so big. 5 MB maximun.<br />
      <br />
      Ths is the code how i use the banner. Tell me if is incorrect<br />
      <br />
      Banner::show /NOUNLOAD 'Installation successfull !'<br />
      IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br />
      Sleep 10<br />
      StrCmp $0 100 0 -2<br />
      Banner::destroy<br />
      abort<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      Then all the code in into the .onInit<br />
      and there is where i use 2 plugins.. advsplash + banner<br />
      the problem is that internal banner from nsis it appear telling "Unpacking data 0%". And i dont know why this appear, because if i not use the banner plugin, it not appear.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">It's because you're using solid compression and decompressing something located at the end of the compressed data block early in installer execution. This could happen if .onInit is located at the bottom of the script and it uses a plug-in. To solve it, .onInit should be moved, or ReserveFile should be used.<br />
      <br />
      Files are added to the compressed data block as they're seen in the script. If a file appears last in the script, it'll be the last file on the data block. Because solid compression compresses the entire data block in one pass, it also has to decompress the entire data block to get to its end. Normally, files are decompressed as they're decompressed because both their extraction order and compression order matches. However, if for some reason, a piece of code which extracts a file is located at the bottom of the script and runs earlier than extraction code above it in the script, you get a delay at the first extraction. It has to decompress the entire block.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well<br />
      <br />
      i can insert all the code not on .onInit, but in this case the installer window it appear. Include if i use the HideWindow, a so fast blink of the installer window flash in and flash out.<br />
      <br />
      For this reason i inserted all the code into the .onInit<br />
      I go to try to make the changes you told to see if i can prevent this "unpacking date" not appear.<br />
      <br />
      But is so strange problem, because not allways happend.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well<br />
      i used the ReserveFile with a file it is in the end part of the solid block. But the "Unpacking Date" still appears. How i told, this nsis banner not come all the times.<br />
      <br />
      At this time, the solution i found to preserve this, is insert all my installer code in a Section and leave the .onInit.<br />
      But doing that i get other issue with the HideWindow command.<br />
      <br />
      Yes,i want to hide the installer window, but before the HideWindow it take effect, a so fast blink of the window installer is pop up with a so ugly effect.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Reserve all plugins (DLLs) you're using in your installer.<br />
      <br />
      As for the fast blink you're referring in other post too, I'm not able to reproduce it or I'm not so fast to see it ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">There's no need in moving the code into sections. All you have to do is move .onInit to the top of the script or use ReserveFile for the files used by .onInit on the top of the script.</p>

      <p class="post-content">According to NSIS manual and to kichik's suggestion, either moving the .onInit function to the top of your script, or using ReserveFile must resolve your problem.<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>  ReserveFile "${NSISDIR}\Plugins\AdvSplash.dll"<br />  ReserveFile "${NSISDIR}\Plugins\Banner.dll"</code>
