      <p class="post-content"><strong>InstallOptions - [Control Placement Tool] DOWNLOAD</strong><br />
      This release is only for placing and resizing controls, you have to write all other parameters yourself (shouldn't be too hard).<br />
      <br />
      This program will let you create, move, and resize the controls supported by InstallOptions. It will also generate a .INI script file that InstallOptions uses to make the window.<br />
      <br />
      It also comes with the source code. :cool:<br />
      <br />
      Please read the readme.txt for more information.<br />

      <p class="post-content">hey is there any reason why you didnt just do button = 1 so that you could left click drag? i tryed it and it worked fine for me... right click dragging just doesnt seem natural in this type of situation...</p>

      <p class="post-content">the right click dragging is a shitty remnat from the other version, where left click loaded the stats and right click dragged.<br />
      <br />
      you can post a recompiled version with your name in the credz, or i will later tonite.<br />

      <p class="post-content">hi. this was a very good idea, to make such a program. it works fine (i think) but the colors are horrible :igor: why don`t you do such an interface like an normal installation? so the user will see the "final" product - how would it looks (hope you understand what i`m talking about)<br />
      <br />
      cheers, trace ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">first : fine to have a ui designer<br />
      <br />
      but :<br />
      <br />
      now it comes.<br />
      the drag n drop feature isnt very good<br />
      it would be better to make it like in any other ui designer<br />
      click on the control that u want then move the mouse to the position on the form and then click on the position where u want it to place<br />
      <br />
      like delphi, vc++ ...<br />
      <br />
      the interface of the programm ...<br />
      ok but it would be better to drag the positions directly not with the textboxes on the bottom.<br />
      <br />
      i'll find some more ...<br />
      <br />
      although its nice for a first try on a designer</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's a very nice tool, I agree with most of the above posts though. It doesn't look too great, standard Window colours would be nicer, and right-click dragging isn't very intuitive (with the last version I didn't even realise that controls could be dragged :D :D ). Resize with the mouse would be nice too. Looks like I got here too late though, and you've probably done all of these things already ;)<br />
      Everything else I can think of is spot on IMO</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm having trouble with controls being placed where I want them on the screen. They always jump to the left about half a control length. Am I missing something like a snap-to-grid feature?<br />
