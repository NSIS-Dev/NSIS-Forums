      <p class="post-content"><strong>Vista: Exec does not work as in XP</strong><br />
      This is no Vista privilege / UAC problem (see other thread if you have your software run in "wrong" virtualisation/elevation mode).<br />
      <br />
      I have some mode where the installer copies itself to TMP and runs from there. This works in XP but not in Vista (tested with UAC on).<br />
      <br />
      The problem is that the temporary file's name does not end with ".exe". So<br />
      <br />
      Exec '"C:\temp\mytmpfile.tmp" /OPTIONS'<br />
      <br />
      does not execute. You will get a warning saying ".tmp" is not associated.<br />
      <br />
      With XP this works without problems.<br />
      <br />
      I know the CreateProcess API and I guess NSIS' Exec just lets the application parameter empty and supplies the exec-string above as "parameter" which generally works fine.<br />
      Furthermore I guess it would be ok to pass the executable file to the first parameter (application). Perhaps XP is here somewhat fuzzy to always assume the first parameter is an executable. So if I'm right the change in Vista seems to make it cleaner.<br />
      <br />
      I personally will check these two options for my installer:<br />
      - get a temp name which ends in ".exe"<br />
      - use own CreateProcess call using the tmp name as application parameter.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Of course the file names will be unique, that's what GetTempFileName does.<br />
      <br />
      We do not have to know how GetTempFileName really works (you can find details in MSDN) but we should just rely on the fact that GetTempFileName creates a NEW file (not existing before). Microsoft may change the way the function works at random.<br />
      <br />
      If GetTempFileName would never try to create the same filename again we could use its internal counter. If it just checks for existence we could not remove a tmp file before getting what we want (filling up the tmp dir). Of course in practise this will work anyway. But then we just could use "mypersonaltmp.exe" or something like that (fixed string).<br />
      <br />
      Anyway we have to run a loop and check for existence of NEWFILE.ext because GetTempFileName will only guarantee that NEWFILE is a new file (without custom extension, e.g. "exe").</p>

      <p class="post-content">Using your short code (gettempfilename, rename, strcpy) will cause problems if the file NEWFILE.ext already exists. You cannot be sure this is the fact without testing it yourself. This is what GetTempFileName is for...<br />
      <br />
      Your GetTempFileNameExt function/macro is more suitable but has the problem of not deleting files in the loop. And there is a theoretical chance of a race condition.<br />
      <br />
      My code had a bug, too: The file is not renamed so the filename is not "locked". Here's the fixed code which should work perfectly:<br />

      <p class="post-content">The following works perfectly fine for me.</p>
      <pre>
<code>GetTempFileName $0<br />CopyFiles $SYSDIR\cmd.exe $0<br />Exec '"$0" /K echo hello'</code>
</pre>Seems like the real problem here is UAC. CreateProcess fails with error 740 (ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED) when trying to execute a program that requires elevation from a non-elevated context. To pop-up the elevation dialog, you need to use ExecShell, but then .tmp isn't associated, as the error says (though I have no idea how it automatically got the idea to ExecShell it). Is your main installer running elevated or not?<br />
      <br />
      Another possible problem is an anti-virus. I have heard about recent versions that deny running applications from the temporary directory. It's possible some took it a step forward (or actually backward in a sane view) and denied only non-exe running from the temporary directory.

      This works with XP SP2 and Vista (UAC still disabled). So the file extension is no problem here. I will do UAC tests later (and post it here).

      <p class="post-content">UAC test: Vista asked for Elevation (I did not use RequestExecutionLevel in nsi in this example). After that the cmd prompt is shown, too. So no problem here (did use my copyfile macro, did not try CopyFiles).<br />

      I don't know why Vista had some problem. I definitely used Exec (not ExecShell or ExecWait) and the file extension definitely made a difference. I cannot reproduce this quickly now :-(<br />
      <br />
      The test machine has McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.5 (enabled), but it is not likely that this caused the problem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">@kichik: No, I didn't / don't use CopyFiles at all (discussed this quite some time ago in another thread...)<br />
      <br />
      McAfee has some of those options, I know. But I cannot see a rule which allows executing ".exe" files but denies to run ".tmp" named executables. Such a rule would be braindead (according Murphy's law this rule will exist...)<br />
      <br />
      I just checked the McAfee 8.5 on the test machine: the access control is/was fully deactivated.<br />
      <br />
      The question is: Why did Vista show the "don't know how tmp files are to open" error message when calling just:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>Exec '"c:\temp\bla123.tmp" /TMPMOVED'</code>

      <p class="post-content">I agree. I personally will just use my GetTempFile macro (see above) to get a temp file with "working" extension.<br />
      <br />
      Here are all necessary details of my setup where I use this (if someone has similar problems or wants to do more debugging...)<br />
      <br />
      - RequestExecutionLevel user<br />
      - The installer checks for its name or some cmd line parameter. If this matches some criteria the installer will copy itself to a TMP filename, call it via Exec (adding all original cmd line parameter plus some extra parameter "/TMPMOVED"), make the TMP filename delete on next reboot, and quit immediately.<br />
      <br />
      This way the original installer exe can be deleted or overwritten by the installation process (which now runs from TMP).<br />
      <br />
      In Vista with UAC the outer (and inner) installer will not run with admin privileges (elevation is done later). If the TMP filename ends with ".tmp" (because generated with GetTempFileName) this will cause a error message box of Vista which says that the file ending is not associated with some program. So I use a tmp filename ending in ".exe" and all works fine.</p>
