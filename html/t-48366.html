If you look at my script you will notice the default install locations is "$PROGRAMFILES\PAWSoft\PAWClock" and the default start menu location is "$SMPROGRAMS\PAWSoft\PAWClock".<br><br>I have been focusing on deleting the PAWClock directory for my tests, without ever considering the PAWSoft directory. I have now tried renaming my PAWSoft directory (both in Program Files and the Start Menu) and reproduced the same errors as shown in the above screenshots.<br><br>So what is happening? NSIS appears to be failing to recursively create the necessary directories. From the NSIS documentation on SetOutPath:<br><br>"Note that it recursively creates it, so if you create C:\poop\dir2\dir3, it will create all that it needs to."<br><br>For some reason in my case this is not happening, as it will only work if the PAWSoft directory is already present. I have tried CreateDirectory as well but this doesn't make any difference.<br><br>The problem is how do I fix it? I cannot create the PAWSoft directory first because the user might not have selected the default installation location.<br><br>Any ideas?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PabUK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">28th April 2001 18:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<br><br>Sorry about that, but I just found out why it wasn't working. It was a bug in NSIS 1.3 (the version I was using). Even though I had glanced through the version 1.4 Beta 1/2 changes several times I didn't (until a moment ago) notice the bit about fixing the recursive create directory.<br><br>This is typical. Previously when something went wrong I would upgrade to the latest NSIS hoping that the problem I had created would be fixed. Of course it never was, because it was my script at fault. This time I didn't do that thinking that it was my script when in fact there really was a bug with NSIS 1.3.<br><br>Very annoying, but at least it is worked out now.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">justin</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th April 2001 07:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">sorry bout that..
