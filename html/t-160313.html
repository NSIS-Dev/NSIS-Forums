It updates some files then just hang there doing nothing, seems like the update is done but the buttons are not enabled. Perhaps a timeout function would be nice. Had to go to task manager every time to end the task.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th December 2003 13:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">CVS is just slow, give it time.

For example, I just updated again, and I got below:<br><br>Initializing CVS Update...<br>U Examples/Modern UI/Basic.nsi<br>P Source/exehead/exec.c<br>P Source/exehead/util.c<br><br>Following which, it just stops there.

The Finished button does not appear, none of the two buttons are enablad. I have to go to Task Manager to end the process.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">19th December 2003 12:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">It's just slow. NSIS Update simply calls cvs95.exe, nothing else. NSIS Update is just a wrapper for the CVS client which connects to SourceForge's CVS server to update your files. Just give it time, sometimes it can even take 10 minutes to complete.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Comm@nder21</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th December 2003 14:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">it would be also very nice, if the update tool would write "ready" Ã­nto its log-windows, after all files had been updated.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th December 2003 20:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">It enables the button and shows 'Task completed' when the update is finished.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Comm@nder21</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th December 2003 21:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">i know, but i think it'd perhaps nice if it says "ready" and gives an "exit"-button and an "restart"/"retry" button, that is needed, if it fails, or for people, that don't want to restart the program everytime.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
