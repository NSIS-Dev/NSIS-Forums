But just because a new employee joins doesn't make it appropreate for him to moderate the forum. It is great the we have a moderator, but it would be much better to have a person who actually spends his time in the forum than anything. I have not seen one post from Aus in this forum and it is not fair. I can think of about 5 other people who would make a better contribution to the forum. I think that if we were to have a moderator now, then it should be one of the 5 who actually spend their time in the forum than a guy who (I think) never gives an Opinion.<br><br>My 5 People are:<br>1) liquidmotion - SlateBlue maker who knows alot about NSIS<br>2) Smile2Me - He is one of the first people to post something<br>3) Pomflain - He helps with understanding the port questions<br>4) rainwater - Maker of the NSIS GUI Wrapper ... need I say more<br>5) pjw62 - Maker of many NSIS "products" including a makensis DLL<br><br>These people should be a moderator just because they spend so much time in the forum and they can answer just about anything about NSIS.<br><br>Thank You,<br>-Duane</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Smile2Me</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th April 2002 08:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I think this is the moment for us guys to react, so:<br><br>I would like to do it.

But I'll wait for the formal "job description" when I would be choosen and see what tasks I should perform besides that (maybe something like checking the integrity of new posts).<br><br>Thx for the really nice words.

I know that you are a developer, but NSIS has spawned a few followers who still develop stuff to make it better and that they should be more involved. You can keep your position, just as long as one of the people I mentioned also become a moderator to help out those who need help.<br><br>-Duane</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Aus</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th April 2002 09:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">How nice of you to let me keep my position.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">spanky</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th April 2002 13:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Looks like Smile2Me became a mod.
