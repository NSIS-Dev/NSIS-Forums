      as some of you may know, i wrote a gui for NSIS a while back. it was relatively successful during its peak, but then it kinda died out. most of the feedback i recieved told me that it was overkill, or that the wizard was the really useful part of the program.<br />
      <br />
      i thought about that, and about 3-4 hours ago started writing a new, smaller and faster wizard for NSIS. just input your info and go.<br />

      there is the link. download or not, no skin off my back :) if you do, however, let me know what you think. it may be a tad outdated, so tell me what i can add to bring it up to speed with the latest NSIS build.<br />

      <p class="post-content">It seems to look good, but you need to make some changes:<br />
      - Gradient color should be set in a color selection dialog.<br />
      - File should be added also by dragging them into the window<br />
      - If I select "Cancel" in the Finsih-dialog it saves the file to the default filename, but it should cancel<br />
      - Filename selection in OpenDialog</p>

      <p class="post-content">Also, in the file selection list, the ability to add different sections, and to move files up/down through it.<br />
      <br />
      Ascii Example:<br />
      [Main]<br />
      C:\File1.txt<br />
      C:\File1.exe<br />
      [Optional]<br />
      E:\File2.txt<br />
      [Optional 1]<br />
      E:\File3.txt<br />
      <br />
      If you get what I'm saying. I think that would help the users more. (I do all my coding in vim though, so, I'm not sure. :))<br />
