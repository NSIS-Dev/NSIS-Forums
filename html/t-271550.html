      <p class="post-content"><strong>OK - this is not funny anymore</strong><br />
      Yesterday I encountered for the first time since I started using NSIS 9 months ago (back then I started with 2.0, now 2.27) the weirdest problem ever:<br />
      <br />
      The script compiles and prepares a setup package EXE file without any problems, warnings or errors.<br />
      <br />
      It even installs perfectly on several Windows XP professional machines.<br />
      <br />
      However... on one, single, Windows XP Professional machine (PII 350MHz 512MB), it:[list=1][*]Reports progress as normal.[*]Reports successful completion.[*]The installed software shows up in Control Panel's "Add/Remove Programs" as installed the way it should be.[*]But... when I go to C:\Program Files folder, I find nothing there. That is, the INSTDIR folder that needs to be created (including all files in it) are simply not there. If I try to create a folder manually there, it is created (i.e. no permission or access problem).[/list=1]<br />
      This does not happen on other machines, so clearly that machine is the problematic one.<br />
      <br />
      But this (problematic) machine is a FRESH INSTALL. What could possibly be wrong in a Windows XP Pro machine?<br />
      <br />
      I even re-installed the entire OS on that machine (it's a test machine, I can afford doing so), but that didn't cure this weird behavior.<br />
      <br />
      Has anyone seen anything like this?<br />
      Any idea what could make NSIS sensitive to apparently some misconfiguration of an XP machine?<br />
      <br />
      Any tip or insight would be very much appreciated as I ran out of ides.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, sometimes it pays to get mad. :)<br />
      <br />
      I found the source for the mystery: That machine has two HDDs: C and D.<br />
      <br />
      XP is installed on the D: drive.<br />
      So $PROGRAMFILES points to D:\Program Files\.<br />
      And I was looking under C:\Program Files\.<br />
      <br />
      I could swear that when Windows installs on any driver, even if it's not the master, it somehow maps it to C:\ by default. I must have been dreaming since Microsoft changed that.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, all is well now - and at least documented for posterity in thsi forum. :p<br />
      <br />
      Thank you all for listening!<br />
