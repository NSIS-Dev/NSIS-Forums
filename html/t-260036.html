      <p class="post-content">What exectly do you want to integrate, "Makensis" and everything in DLL?<br />
      <br />
      BTW <a href="http://www.molebox.com" target="_blank">www.molebox.com</a> might be of help for you, just make a stub DLL that comunicates with makensis.<br />
      <br />
      I'm NOT related to molebox.</p>

      </blockquote>Absolutely. Would be nice of you to also publish the solution. A patch for the build system would be even better.

      </blockquote>Hi and thanks for your times.<br />
      <br />
      The best solution should be creating a DLL including all in one. But in the first time, i will be satisfy if only "Makensis" was in it, with the possibility to set the path of needed files to compile.<br />
      <br />
      I will try to do it, as Kichik tell me i could :o)
