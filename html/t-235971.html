      <p class="post-content"><strong>SetBrandingImage error</strong><br />
      Hi everybody. It's been a long time since I was around here last time, so I welcome you all in 2006 :- D.<br />
      <br />
      I've been trying to add a branding image to my installer. But the NSIS compiler issues the following error:<br />
      "Error: no branding image found in chosen UI".<br />
      <br />
      I tried putting this in .onInit and didn't work.. then I put it like this:<br />
      <br />
      &lt; CODE &gt;<br />
      Function .onInit<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      <br />
      Section "My main installation" SEC01<br />
      SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"<br />
      File "ASD.bmp"<br />
      SetBrandingImage "$INSTDIR\ASD.bmp"<br />
      SetOverwrite on<br />
      &lt; CODE &gt;<br />
      <br />
      Then I tried putting it in onGUIInit but it says "Error: Function named ".onGUIInit" already exists" allthough I only declared it once.<br />
      <br />
      Secondly, what size should the branding image be? I put 164 x 314, as I saw that the original was... is this correct?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you in advance for your help :- ).<br />
      <br />
      How can I make it work?? :- ).</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hm</strong><br />
      I just saw something after I searched the forum, but I don't know if it'll work. Anyway, my question about the size remains. If I put that size will NSIS still auto-calculate stuff?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Before using SetBrandingImage, you must use AddBrandingImage or add your own branding image control to the UI. AddBrandingImage accepts a size parameter and prints out the size that eventually came out.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Thanks</strong><br />
      Hi again kichik ::- ). You do know you're in my "Thanks to" file right? ::- D. This is for the installer for the Beta 2 of my freeware application and I mentioned in the thanks section (almost) everybody that helped in any area of the project.<br />
      <br />
      Hm. I suspected something about AddBrandingImage. But hey, I searched through this forum and investigated some posts and stuff like this really makes me dizzy:<br />
      <br />
      &lt; CODE &gt;<br />
      <br />
      !macro BIMAGE IMAGE PARMS<br />
      Push $0<br />
      GetTempFileName $0<br />
      File /oname=$0 "${IMAGE}"<br />
      SetBrandingImage ${PARMS} $0<br />
      Delete $0<br />
      Pop $0<br />
      !macroend<br />
      <br />
      [...]<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro BIMAGE "${NSISDIR}\pics\tmp1.bmp" "/RESIZETOFIT"<br />
      <br />
      &lt; CODE &gt;<br />
      <br />
      So what's all this? I don't see any use of AddBrandingImage, just SetBrandingImage. This code is taken from:<br />

      I apologize for not reading quite so much from the NSIS documentation as I would have liked too, but you are a developer so you MUST now how hard it is to do everything on your own :- ). I barely have time to eat due to the deadlines I self-impose to myself.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That thread doesn't contain a complete example. Examples\gfx.nsi contains a complete example that uses both AddBrandingImage and SetBrandingImage.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Yes</strong><br />
      And where can I see the image that the installer will use for a picture? It will output it at compilation time?</p>

      <p class="post-content">No, you set that using SetBrandimgImage. AddBrandingImage adds the image control to the UI and SetBrandimgImage sets the image on the control.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Size</strong><br />
      There were lots of discussions around here about picture size. I would prefer to dictate a size for the image control and put in that a picture of the same size. For example if I say 200x50, to keep it that way. But as far as I saw, it's more complicated than that.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I did my important stuff for now with<br />
      MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP<br />
      <br />
      I'll probably leave this as is for the time being because on 25 January I got to release Beta 2 for my freeware application and this is really pressing me.</p>
