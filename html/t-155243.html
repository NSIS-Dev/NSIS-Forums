      <p class="post-content"><strong>dllunregisterserver entry point not found</strong><br />
      Hi everybody,<br />
      <br />
      I have made an NSIS setup program that installs my program exe and upgrades the visual c++ 6 run time library components. I used the "Upgrade a DLL (macro)" and something similar to the example in the NSIS documentation called "How to install the VB6 runtimes<br />
      " with an extra activex file that needs to be upgraded, too.<br />
      <br />
      It works on win98, but not on nt4. the start page doesn't show up and says "error opening the file for writing //iospecial.ini". and if I ignore it, it says "error opening the file for writing //modern-wizard.bmp" if I ignore it, licence text opens (the start page skipped), and it continues until "installing" page. then it says "cannot find symbol: DllUnregisterServer"<br />
      <br />
      I made another setup and tried to update the regsvr32.exe before the dll files, but it didn't make any improvement. I also tried to manually upgrade a dll file and register it. it said "dllunregisterserver entry point not found", but it can register an activex file successfully. the restarts aftet manually upgrading the regsvr32.exe did not make any improvement either.<br />
      <br />
      i'm really stuck here. nt4 has the internet explorer 6 sp1 and service pack 6a, and all the latest important updates have been done. is there somebody who can help me solve this problem?<br />
      <br />
      thanks in advance...</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are two separate problems here.<br />
      <br />
      1) The file you are upgrading does not have to be registered, it does not contain the dllunregisterserver entry point. Regsvr32 reports this too and does not register the file (read the regsvr32 message carefully, it says that it can load the dll, but there is no entry point). You should define UPGRADEDLL_NOREGISTER.<br />
      <br />
      2) There are interface problems with the Modern UI Welcome page. It looks like NSIS failed to create a temporary plug-ins folder. But if there would be a problem with the temporary folder, NSIS should report that. Are you sure you are using the latest development version (see <a href="http://nsis.sf.net" target="_blank">http://nsis.sf.net</a>)?</p>
