So I check every file of the patch if exists on the current installation and if it exists I save it and if it doesn't exist I write its path in a file.<br>Anyway I made it on win xp and it works fine but after, when I tried it on win 7 it didn't work. It seems that every file doesn't exist. I checked the correctness of the path and every path is correct but if the file exists it doesn't copy it like I want but it write every path in the file as if the file doesn't exist. What is the problem? or what could be the problem...<br><br>bennaloz</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th January 2012 11:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">x64 file system redirection comes to mind.

I thought to read the install directory from the registry and it could work in every windows OS. But in XP it works and in 7 seems not. Patch files have been extracted in $TEMP\myfolder. Anyway I think I understood what the problem is. I used for some paths C:\programs\myapp\ for XP. But in win 7 I need C:\program files\myapp if it is x32 or C:\program(x86) if it is x64. My application is a x32 application so should I use $PROGRAMFILES32? I hope I was clear in my explanation</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bennaloz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th January 2012 13:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><small>Originally posted by MSG</small><br>edit: D'oh, nevermind. ~_~</blockquote>ahah :D ? ~.~</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bennaloz</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">17th January 2012 07:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">problem solved sorry for the stupid thread. :( :bin:<br>I simply read from the registry the path of the installation directory and it changes in according to the operating system. I could also use $PROGRAMFILES/$PROGRAMFILES32 that's the same but reading from the RegKey I have the complete path so it's more convenient</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
