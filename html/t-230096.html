<code><br>!define "" "xyz"<br></code>
</pre><br>
      is a valid command- the compiler accepts it.<br>
      However, there is no way to use this defined "symbol".<br>
      e.g.,<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>MessageBox MB_OK "${}"<br></code>
</pre><br>
      displays "${}", not "xyz".<br>
      <br>
      A couple of exceptions I have found are:

      <ul>
        <li>A label cannot start with !,0-9,$,-, or +. (However, after the first character in the label name, anything is fair game.)</li>

        <li>A GoTo target cannot start with 0-9, $, or !. (ditto)</li>
      </ul>The absence of any real naming convention should normally not be an issue since I doubt that many people are creating weird names for functions, sections, labels, variables or symbols, but it still doesn't seem right.<br>
      <br>
      Why do I bring this up? Well, I am developing an IDE for NSIS in Eclipse (see link in my signature), and it is really difficult to create a syntax highlighter/checker when the scripting language is so freeform.<br>
      Hence, I was wondering what were others' thoughts on this issue.<br>
      <br>
      So... should there be a naming convention for NSIS?

      <p class="post-content">My short answer: absolutely!<br>
      My long answer: however, I think most languages have notable exceptions like that, and a syntax highlighting engine would simply have to deal with those.<br>
      <br>
      Personally I'd just exclude the use of quotes in a define, period.<br>
      E.g.<br>
      !define "foo bar" "hello world"<br>
      is perfectly legal - but it's pretty zany coding :)<br>
      <br>
      ----------<br>
      <br>
      I've found other things to be far more concerning, really :)<br>
      (though they don't affect syntax highlighting, I think)<br>
      <br>
      For example...<br>
      <br>
      Why does RMDir, by default, not remove non-empty directories...<br>
      But DeleteRegKey, by default, does remove non-empty keys?<br>
      I.e. in the first instance you have to specify /r if you want it to delete the dir, even if it's not empty - and in the latter you need to specify /ifempty to make sure it's not deleting keys that aren't empty.<br>
      Might be semantics..<br>
      <br>
      In terms of programming, however...<br>
      Why is it<br>
      StrCpy &lt;output&gt; &lt;input&gt;<br>
      and<br>
      SectionGetText &lt;ID&gt; &lt;output&gt;<br>
      <br>
      I.e. why is the output sometimes the first argument, and sometimes the last ? (perhaps even things inbetween, haven't encountered that yet though)<br>
      <br>
      I'm mostly used to scripting languages going :<br>
      &lt;output&gt; = &lt;something&gt;<br>
      e.g.<br>
      &lt;output&gt; = &lt;input&gt;<br>
      and<br>
      &lt;output&gt; = SectionGetText &lt;id&gt;<br>
      I understand NSIS uses a language more akin to C, but these (to me) inconsistent bits had my brain hurting in the beginning.</p>

      Well, it's like in a DLL function call: you can't put spaces, but the compiler shows in the list of DLL calls plug-ins with spaces in their names... I could just use "CallInstDLL" to be able to call plug-ins with spaces, but there is no plug-in existant that has any spaces in their names, so it's not really that useful.

      <p class="post-content">The only issue would be backward compatability.<br>
      However, I don't think you would find many people doing something like this:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code><br>!define "${foo}" bar<br></code>
</pre><br>
      This is a perfectly valid command- compiler accepts it. :D

      <p class="post-content">Does ${foo} in those instances contain spaces ?<br>
      If not, the quotation marks aren't needed ?<br>
      <br>
      --<br>
      <br>
      Overall the define stuff doesn't matter so much to me, if the only purpose of a fix would be to remove the non-issue (imho) of being able to define an empty var but not being able to refer to it :)</p>

      </blockquote>Do you really define symbols like "${foo}"?<br>
      Or do you mean:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>!define "foo"</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Because if you really mean:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>!define "${foo}"</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      then you should refer to it in code with "${${foo}}". Unwieldy at best.<br>
      <br>
      What I mean when I said the compiler accepts:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>!define "$foo}" bar</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      is that it accepts it even if "foo" has not been defined.<br>
      Essentially it allows you to define a symbol whose <b>literal</b> name is ${foo}.
