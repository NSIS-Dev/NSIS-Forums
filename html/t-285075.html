      <p class="post-content"><strong>ANSI/UNICODE Special Char Entries help please</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I've searched the WIKI and the forum already.<br />
      The only thing that I found was the Unicode version of NSIS, I've tried it and still doesn't work.<br />
      <br />
      So I think I should start some post.<br />
      <br />
      Ok, I'm currently working on the uTorrent (<a href="http://www.utorrent.com" target="_blank">http://www.utorrent.com</a>) installer [not official]. Which will contains All of its plugins, WebUI, Language, icons, etc.<br />
      <br />
      I've managed to make it works for sometimes now, however up until now I figured that the Uninstall entries and the shortcut entries are not exactly the same as the program itself. Since the name "uTorrent" , the 'u' character in this place stands for micro(Âµ) &lt;&lt; the Special character representing the power of 9 in Mathematics, not the normal 'u' we've already known about.<br />
      <br />
      So all I want is to change all of my entries to this 'Âµ' instead. However, it doesn't seems to work at all. I tried to converting my script to the Unicode format so that I can put this 'Âµ' in my script. But the shortcut and the uninstall entries display wrong character.<br />
      <br />
      Below are my Screenies:<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      <br />
      I have no idea what to do now. Any suggestions anyone?<br />
      May be the only way to do this is to use the RAW ASCII code or something..<br />
      <br />
      Thank you guys.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not sure about, though, I think it should be depended on target system's language options.</p>

      <p class="post-content">T_T, well that's too bad then..I've just found the Âµ ASCII code. But don't know how to use it in NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      The ASCII code for "Âµ" is 'ALT+0181' (without +).<br />

      I guess I might have to leave it like this.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the reply ^^</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want a Unicode registry key, Unicode Windows API calls should be used to write it. Assuming that the unofficial Unicode NSIS version uses these Unicode registry functions, I think you should check whether the encoding of your script file is correct.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, the mu symbol also exists in all the standard Windows ANSI codepages.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I see.., I think it's my system then. hmm.<br />
      My system could not save 'Âµ' character in ANSI encoding script, I have to convert it to UTF. T_T<br />
      <br />
      So I think there's no way to make this installer on my system.. so sad..<br />
      <br />
      But, thanks anyway for the replies.<br />
      Cheers ^^</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't give up, Somewhere along the line you made a small mistake. IMHO The best is to start with a real minimal NSIS script from *scratch* which does nothing more than to write and entry in the registry like:<br />
      <br />
      WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\mytestentry" "DisplayName" "ÂµMyTest"<br />
      <br />
      So NO old code just make a small NEW script...<br />
      <br />
      etc.etc.<br />
      <br />
      It can be done, see attatchment where for fun I changed 7-Zip uninstall entry.<br />
      <br />
      TIP: read this about Unicode for a good understanding.<br />

      <br />
      Good luck, and thank you for choosing NSIS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Right, now I can see that it is very normal character to the system. However, with normal script encoding (ANSI) in my system. I couldn't get it out, it displays 'à¸•' instead of 'Âµ'.<br />
      <br />
      What editor are you using? I'm using Notepad ++?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can also use a solution similar to the following with the ANSI version.<br />

      <p class="post-content">SoKoOLz, just curious... what happened when you tried to use the Unicode NSIS? Was there a specific problem? Are you using some plugins that are not part of the regular NSIS install?</p>
