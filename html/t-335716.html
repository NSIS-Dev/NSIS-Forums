      <p class="post-content">The default environment variables for the current user are stored at:<br />
      <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment</b><br />
      <br />
      For the system (all users) they are stored at:<br />
      <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment</b><br />
      <br />
      You can use NSIS' registry functions to read the current value of "PATH", add your directory to it and write the new value back.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is not a good idea:<br />
      <br />
      <b>A)</b> Why fill the global path with your crap, there is a total limit, what if all apps did this? It is possible to add per application path info in the registry under "App Paths"<br />
      <br />
      <b>B)</b> Using normal NSIS strings to manipulate global variables is a very bad idea, if the user has a %path% longer than 1024 you will corrupt their setup!</p>

      </blockquote>You should at least ask the user whether he wants your tool to be added to his PATH.<br />
      <br />
      As an alternative you can add a shortcut to the Startmenu that opens a console with your tool added to the PATH, instead of adding your tool to the PATH globally. Many applications, like Visual Studio or GIT, use this technique.<br />
      <br />
      The command for the Startmenu shortcut could be something like:<br />
      <b>%comspec% /k ""$INSTDIR\setpath.bat""</b><br />
      <br />
      And the "setpath.bat" could be created on-the-fly by the installer and should look like:<br />
      <pre>
<code>@echo off<br />echo Setting up environment for Super Duper Tool...<br />set "PATH=C:\Path To Your Tool;%PATH%"</code>
</pre>

      <p class="post-content">Option 1:<br />
      Backup the "old" path at install time. Restore it at un-install time. Chnages that have been made since install will be lost!<br />
      <br />
      Option 2:<br />
      Read the current PATH at un-install time and use string functions to find "your" path in the current PATH. If found, remove only that part and write the modified PATH back. Harder to do than Option 1, but no changes made by other apps will be lost. However this solution again has the problem that "standard" NSIS can not cope with strings longer than 1024 characters!<br />
      <br />
      Option 3:<br />
      Avoid modifying the global PATH environment variable from the very beginning, as has been suggested before in this thread. No problem with un-install and no NSIS string limitations. Probably the cleanest solution that you can go for...</p>

      </blockquote>You don't have to.<br />
      <br />
      At install time, simply save your $INSTDIR to some (unique) registry key of your own.<br />
      <br />
      At un-install time, read that registry key. No string manipulations will be required.<br />
      <br />
      And, as on Windows the MAX_PATH is 260, the 1024 characters of an NISIS string are sufficient - for a <i>single</i> path.<br />
      <br />
      (Actually the uninstaller will already have $INSTDIR set to the path it was started from)
