      <p class="post-content">in most cases laptop use special cpus.. the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nopey_-_system_setting_tool" target="_blank">nopey</a> plugin might be useful - but it wouldn't be certain that it's not some thinclient desktop computer using a mobile processor or some laptop with a desktop processor</p>

      <p class="post-content">Suppose you're discovering that you're running on a Notebook, how does this affect the installer?<br />
      If your installation is cpu specific you should check the cpu, if it is graphics specific you should check graphics, if it is ram, check ram, OS check OS and so on.<br />
      The only reason I could think about, is the case when you'd like to start a large download on a machine with a slow dial up connection, so you'd like to discover if the machine is running with AC power or DC power and inform users about the possibility of a broken installation because of the battery.<br />
      Is there any other reason?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I just wanted to bring this question back into light since I have a similar dilemma...<br />
      <br />
      I have an installer that I want to function one way on a laptop and another way on a desktop... Since it has been some time since 2007, is there anything new that anyone can think of that I can key against to determine if it is a laptop or a desktop..? I am going to look into this, but can NSIS do WMI queries..?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">There is a WMI plug-in or you can just call wmic directly using ExecDos or you can write and call a C/C++ DLL that does your WMI queries.<br />
