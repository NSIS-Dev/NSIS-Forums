      <p class="post-content"><strong>Preview skins, like in Winamp installer</strong><br />
      I want to make an installer with skins for some player (about 50 skins).<br />
      How to make a preview of each skin (like in Winamp installer)?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i guess the winamp-installer uses a installoptions page with bitmaps included. you have to make one bitmap for each skin.. or write a clever plugin which extracts the images from the skin and arranges them properly in one image file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok. Bluenet, thanks for the script, I'll try to understand how to do it for myself.<br />
      But just another question: Winamp shows only 2 skins in one window, but if there are 50 skins - is it possible to scroll their bitmaps in one window? I think it's not a good idea to show only 2-4 skins in every window, and to click ~20 times "Next" to see all of them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mabye two options:<br />
      1. InstallOptionsEx <i>maybe</i> can do it (ScrollBar controls).<br />
      2. Build a plugin with auto scrolls..</p>

      </blockquote>Nope.<br />
      <br />
      You could use a listbox or a droplist where you could select a skin and then use a bitmap control to put the skin's picture when it's selected.

      </blockquote>You can use Droplist to show all of your skins, I will write a example later for you :)<br />
      <br />
      But 50 skins you must extract 50 BMP to user's system before you show your skins. The installer may become large.

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, Bluenet. It's a big help for me.<br />
      So, I'll put the checkbox near droplist to check / uncheck every skin.<br />
      Is it possible to see all checked skins in the next window (for example "Checked Skns:" and in droplist I'll write skin names one under another (simply to put text in droplist) or is it possible to to make next window as Sections where only skin names and checkboxes and some of them (wich was checked in previous window) will be checked (as a result a can choose skin in "preview window" or if I don't want to list (see) all of them, I'll use simple "sections window"). Results of "sections window" must owerwrite those from "Preview window".<br />
      Sorry, if my questions are too annoying:).</p>

      <p class="post-content">hello,<br />
      <br />
      I am a little in the same case (it is to install skins for StreamRipper).<br />
      my installer uses radio buttons for the choice of the skin to be put by default, but your system of list with preview likes me much.<br />
      how to make for the choice in the list changes the value in the "WriteINIStr ...".<br />
      I hope to render comprehensible myself because I am French</p>

      <p class="post-content">I guess what you want is how to check which skin user selected. In my example $2 store the index of the droplist, the top of item is 0 and so on. Aslo you can use ReadINIStr and StrCmp to do this.</p>

      user select a skin &amp; push 'install' button, then the installer install the suitable skin.<br />
