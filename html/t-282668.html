Very likely I am doing something wrong because NSIS badly complains at me.<br>Here is an example:<br><br>Say, I would like different files to be extracted depending on the language that the user chooses from a dropdown list. I store their choice in a user variable $MyLang, like so<br><br>var $MyLang<br><br>In the "install" section, I would like to do this:<br>IfFileExists "..\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile" 0 +3<br>file "..\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile"<br>goto SomewhereElse<br>MessageBox MB_OK "No supporting files for your particular language found ,defaulting to English."<br>file "..\SomePath\SomeFileInEnglish"<br><br>It seems that both IFFileExists and File commands ignore my $MyLang variable. In the case of File instruction NSIS complains that "..\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile" cannot be found.<br><br>Any ideas on how I can solve this problem?<br>I am suspecting that NSIS doesn't like my variables because they are filled in at runtime, but there has to be some way around this.<br><br>Thanks for any help.<br>Regards,<br>Vic</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Fightin_Foo</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th December 2007 15:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You may be right about NSIS not liking the variables because they are filled at runtime. Have you considered writing a macro or function to extract the files for each language you are supporting? You can still take the input from the user and then put the MyLang variable into a switch or a series of if else if, and then NSIS only extract the files according to the selected language. It may make your installer bigger than you wanted, and there is probably a better solution out there, but it should work.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">vtsaran</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th December 2007 18:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><strong>I guess that may work, but seems a bit inefficient</strong><br>Thanks for your suggestion. I guess, this would my last choice as I wanted all the matching happen automatically. In my installer tree I have folders that are named according to the language abbreviations and it would be easier if the extraction was dependant on one variable rather than on the set of if-else statements. This means that I would not have to modify the installer every time a new language (think folder) is added.<br>Any more cool ideas out there? :)<br>Thanks.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Coolblu77</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">6th December 2007 10:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I'm not sure why the IfFileExisits would ignore your variable.<br><br>But I was under the impression that File was used to add files in at compile time and then extract them during installation.<br>So it makes sense that a variable cannot be used here.<br><br>How about, adding the extra files you want to distribute along with the installation.exe, not compiled into the exe but in a seperate folder, then use something like:<br>CopyFiles "$EXEDIR\SomePath\$MyLang\" "$INSTDIR"<br>(This will copy all the files in the $MyLang directory to the installation directory.)<br>CopyFiles "$EXEDIR\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile" "$INSTDIR"<br>(or this will only copy one file)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">vtsaran</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">7th December 2007 01:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">OK thanks, I will give this a thought and a shot! :)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
