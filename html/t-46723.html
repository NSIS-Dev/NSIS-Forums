The DLL has to export a method called DllGetVersion - if it doesn't then this method will not return any version information.<br><br>In that case you have to fall back to one of the other means of querying the DLL for a version number, i.e. GetFileVersion.<br><br>I can't be sure if GetFileVersion will search the default paths or not, it's a bit hard to tell from the Win32 API docs. Basically they say that GetModuleHandle which it calls does not need a path, it doesn't say what happens if it doesn't have one.<br><br>I *believe* it will search the default path since that whole chunk of the Win32 API is connected with loading and using DLLs which involves obeying path information.<br><br>I'll have to update those docs when I move them across to the new database, thanks for spotting that.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st June 2002 16:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Grr wish I could edit posts, first line should say "it will work *without* a path".</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sunjammer</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st June 2002 16:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Just checked - shdocvw.dll *does* support the DllGetVersion mechanism... check the attached text file for full version info on that dll using my code.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">glenncarr</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st June 2002 17:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">:D Great!
