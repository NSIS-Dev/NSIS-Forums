      <p class="post-content"><strong>Double installer</strong><br />
      I have separate installers for two related programs. Can I write one script for them and generate separate uninstallers? I thought I was succeeding, by altering variables such as ${PRODUCT_NAME_1} and ${PRODUCT_NAME_2}, and PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY_1 and PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY_2.<br />
      <br />
      However, when I came to the uninstaller, I did not know how to proceed with separate installers, unable to detect or distinguish between the names of the products within the uninstaller code.<br />
      <br />
      I would appreciate some comment and direction. Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">All those variables are very specific to your script and are not common for every script. It's hard to say whether you can adept your script to build another installer/uninstaller without seeing it.<br />
      <br />
      If you have some defines that you want to compare and change the script accordingly, you can use !if ${PRODUCT_NAME_1} == "something".</p>

      <p class="post-content">kichik, thank you very much for commenting. I relied on the last character of the parent folder of each uninstaller as the distinguishing flag. After about a day and a half of work, the result is a very clean "double" installer. I had expected it to be quick and easy, but it turned out to be quite tricky for me.</p>
