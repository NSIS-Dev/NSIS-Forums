      <p class="post-content"><strong>New stuff</strong><br />
      As I'm leaving tomorrow on vacation for a week, I have decided to release some partial work I have done in the last few days that might interest a lot of you.<br />
      <br />
      This version includes the possibility to easily show more than one license page (second license, readme page, whatever you want) and permits access to NSIS's NLF strings so you don't have to redefine them. A list of the LangString names is in Source\lang.cpp. To use any string in the uninstaller just prefix it with "un." and NSIS will take care of the rest. This feature, hmm... Doesn't really work so good at the moment ;)<br />
      <br />
      You can get this version here:<br />
      <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/newstuff.zip" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/newstuff.zip</a><br />
      An example is attached.<br />
      <br />
      I haven't uploaded it to CVS because it's not ready yet and I haven't completely tested it. If you find anything quirky it would help if you post it here. Expect encountering missing strings, mixed up strings and lots of weird characters if you're using a language that uses characters with the value of 253, 254 or 255.<br />
      <br />
      As I said, I'm going on vacation, so I won't be able to answer any forum/IRC questions in the next few days.<br />
      <br />
      Bye</p>

      <p class="post-content">My flight got postponed, so I have made yet another version. Same URL, example attached. Notice there are now two directory pages and each one is using a different variable to work with. There is also a license agreement in the uninstaller, don't forget to read it ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Great addition! I'm using the extra license pages to allow for an intro section, a requirements section and then a license section. Is there a way to change the message box title so it doesn't append ":License Agreement" to each of those windows? Thanks!<br />

      <p class="post-content">See SubCaption under documentation.<br />
      Thinking now, how is it possible to use SubCaption when there are multiple LicensePage's; won't it place the same text on all?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Same URL, lots of new stuff. No more /LANG (one license for all languages for example), more default strings (default LicenseText for example) and more stuff that I don't remember.<br />
      <br />
      bla2.nsi is included in the zip file this time and shows how to set the caption too.<br />

      I'll be back answering questions soon.<br />
