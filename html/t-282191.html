      <p class="post-content"><strong>This is so fustrating</strong><br />
      I have tried so many times to get an installer perfect for me but failed.<br />
      <br />
      I have been trying to use a an Experience UI skin<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I wanted to be able to have an Experience UI skin, with a FULL screen image using BGImage i think, with some custom text on it.<br />
      <br />
      I wanted to have a Flash Screen(Completed)<br />
      <br />
      I wanted to have Options to install different files(Completed)<br />
      <br />
      I wanted to create an updater, and end of install it to run the .exe file and update...<br />
      <br />
      I wanted proper registry info, so when i make an update and they dl, and install the .exe file it updates the Version from 4.6 to 4.62 but if they dl an older patch manually it see's that the version is wrong and tells them to go re-download.<br />
      <br />
      Also I wanted the Installer add info to registry about location of where it was installed, so updates would automatically see where it was installed..(added the add/remove registry bits...)<br />
      <br />
      On the Uninstaller i wanted an option to eather remove mIRC or LG if they removed LG then i wanted a new uninstaller just for the mIRC</p>

      <p class="post-content">What is "so frustrating" ? This ******* title that provides no information about the issue ? The fact that readers have to read your post to know that they have nothing to tell you about your problem ? Yes it is !!!!!<br />
      <br />
      So let me tell you I really don't mind about your thread since I am not interested in updaters.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You'll have to be more specific on what exactly fails, how it fails and what you've tried. It's hard explaining the entire required process to a detail level where it'll just work.</p>
