How can I do it?<br><br>For example.<br><br>I have two versions of program. First one is Free version (Free.exe) and second one is Pro version (Pro.exe).<br>I need to do an installer that will show Custom Page (after License page) with possibility to decide which program user wants to install.<br>Something like this:<br><br>RadioButtons on Custom Page:<br><br>1. My Program, version Free<br>2. My Program, version Pro<br><br>If User choose first radiobutton Installer will install 1 program (Free), when he decide to install the second one Installer will install 2 program - Pro version. How to show this file on the next Page - Components List?<br>After user choose one of them Installer will show another Page, with Components List - Here will be for example Version Free (or Pro) and a few other folders (that user can check and decide to install or not. After this, on another Page user choose a directory to install the files.<br><br>Is it possible to do that in NSIS? How?<br>Please help me with this.<br>Thanks in advance.<br>Pawel</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd October 2006 19:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">This should help.<br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Two_installations_in_one_installer" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Two_inst..._one_installer</a><br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Pawel</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd October 2006 20:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Afrow UK</i><br><b>This should help.<br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Two_installations_in_one_installer" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Two_inst..._one_installer</a><br><br>-Stu</b></blockquote>Thanks, but this is not exactly what I want...<br>In Your example we can install two programs - I want to Install only one of them - and only 1 program must be on the list of components - this program what user choosen.<br>Any ideas?</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">3rd October 2006 20:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I said it would help. What you need is much more complicated however.<br>It would be much simpler to have three installer executables.

Just FYI.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
