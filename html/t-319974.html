I've left the Unicode one there, and copied the Contrib and Plugins directories to the NSIS install root folder (therefore keeping the directory structure from the original download). What files should be copied into \Include from the download? Following the guide on the wiki, it says to put nsh files in \Includes - the plugin doesn't appear to have nsh files, only nsi ones.<br><br>Many thanks for your help - and I'm sure once I've sorted this out, I'll be back with twenty more questions!<br><br>Cheers again<br><br>James</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Animaether</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th June 2010 17:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">the plugin probably doesn't have a .nsh file. .nsh files are header files which contain code - usually macros/functions - that users can include in their own script and then easily make use of.<br><br>Most plugins don't really use headers as the plugin already provides abstracted commands and such.<br><br>So you should be fine with just the inetc.dll file in the Plugins folder, really.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">redxii</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th June 2010 18:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Inetc is just inetc.dll, ignore the rest of the files they are just examples or source code.<br><br>Alternatively, you can put the plug-in in the same folder as your script, but add this to the top of your script:<br><br>!addplugindir .<br><br>Same for *.nsh:<br><br>!addincludedir .<br><br>(The period is part of the command)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th June 2010 18:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Note it's !addplugin<u>s</u>dir.<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">lake54</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th June 2010 19:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">OK quick question - erm, is there any sort of wizard to get a newbie like me started?
