      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS Installation Creator/Editor</strong><br />
      As you'll propably know from the other thread: "NSIS Script Editor", I am developing a Script Editor for NSIS that makes creating scripts a lot easier. N.I.C.E. means NSIS Installation Creator/Editor. Since I am going to rewrite the whole program in C#, I'd like to know what features you want to see (even those that you already saw in other (NSIS) editors). A few that will be implemented are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Syntax highlighting</li>

        <li>New project wizard</li>

        <li>Template scripts (to install .exe, plugins, etc..)</li>

        <li>Syntax correction (When hitting enter on a line containing a false instruction, it replaces it)</li>

        <li>Compile errors and warnings (shows them beneath your project)</li>

        <li>NSIS Project (manage multiple files in one project)</li>

        <li>Language file editor</li>

        <li>Wizards for common tasks (like File, etc..)</li>

        <li>Plugin insert wizard</li>

        <li>Auto update (NSIS and N.I.C.E. from the internet (via CVS if you want))</li>

        <li>Show possible parameters (simple, shows the syntax under the line you are typing in)</li>

        <li>Show possible parameters (extended, shows possible parameter values for the instructions)</li>

        <li>XML-compiling (XML-loading will be fatser)</li>

        <li>Autocomplete (When you start typing an instruction, N.I.C.E. completes it)</li>

        <li>Compile from program (with NSIS, no compiler setup)</li>

        <li>Shortcut keys (F5 for compiling for example)</li>

        <li>Find and Replace</li>

        <li>Autosave (every <i>n</i> minutes)</li>

        <li>Line numbers, character spacing (Row 12, Col 45)</li>

        <li>Sidebar with functions, help and project information.</li>

        <li>Comment complete block (out)</li>

        <li>Script rewriting (removes all the spaces and tabs from the beginning of the lines and add them again, for nice code-readability)</li>

        <li>Save comments, author and other information with the project (or script)</li>

        <li>Standard text-editor functions (copy, paste, etc...)</li>

        <li>Follow label-, function- and macro-pointers (double click on a macro name to see the definition)</li>
      </ul>Long list, don't you think? If you have anything to add, thing I must implement, thing I never should implement, etc.., let me know!

      </blockquote>What are you scared for? .Net sounds great (according to the .Net magazine :o)<br />
      By the way, I haven't programmed any program yet in C#.<br />
      Do you have any other suggestion of programming language, or should I stick to VB6, which doesn't meet my requirements any more?

      <p class="post-content">The main problem with .net for desktop use is the 20MB+ runtime, also it doesn't work on older versions of Windows (can't remember if that's just Win95 or also Win98).<br />
      <br />
      Personally not sure if it's really worth people simply writing n different text editors for NSIS. It's great that you're prepared to spend the time and effort but what it could really do with is a proper gui linked to the editor in the same way as Wise and Installshield.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The .NET Frameworks works on all Win32 versions except Windows 95, but that's not a real problems, it's 7 years old.<br />
      <br />
      I also think that there are enough text editors now. It's better to combine efforts to write a good GUI linked to the script.</p>

      This may be beyond the scope of a mere script editor, but I would like to see an integrated development environment with a debugger that would:<br />
      - Let you step through your code as it executes, with the option of express-executing (i.e. without stepping through) a function or section.<br />
      - Display the current contents of the stack, user-variables, and NSIS variables.</p>

      </blockquote>This is not possible since the NSIS compiler doesn't support it. It might be an idea for NSIS 3.0, but until then, I won't even try to support it. It's way to difficult.
