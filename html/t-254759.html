Reading through UAC site i noticed that the setup shoud be emarked with requestedExecutionLevel to highestAvailable.<br><br>I read another post on using Mt.exe but "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin\Mt.exe" -manifest setup.exe.manifest -outputresource:setup.exe.cab;#1, the size of the cab file reduces and when i try to execute i get corrupted installer.<br><br>Can somebody help me on how to properly embed a manifest file into the isntaller.<br><br>Thanks and Regards<br>-C</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">onad</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th September 2006 11:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">There are TWO different things involved:<br><br>1)<br>Your have to authenticode sign the application<br>(NOTE: You need buy a certificate for this, see <a href="http://www.thawte.com/ssl-digital-certificates/code-signing/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.thawte.com/ssl-digital-ce...ing/index.html</a> )<br><br>2)<br>Add to the installer the minimum rights in a manifest.<br><a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=250937" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....hreadid=250937</a><br><br>Yes it is Vista, things changed ;) good luck, since you need that with this one...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ckm</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">14th September 2006 07:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">For testing i am using Basic.nsi script sample.

Use !packhdr to execute it while it's built. If you don't do this, you'll get CRC errors, which is what I have to assume you have.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ckm</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">15th September 2006 12:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks Kichik i was looking at perl plugin example how they do it and still in the process of doing this.
