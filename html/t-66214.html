      <p class="post-content">This warez site is pathetic. Tons of freeware. Winamp 2.77 has been "warezed" too. So has RedHat Linux.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Most warez sites are run by young kids.<br />
      The entire scene is pathetic. Not paying for your software is pathetic. And if you visit warez sites you will spend more time closing pop-up windows and resuming broken transfers then you would flipping burgers to pay for the software.<br />
      <br />
      heh, which reminds me. I actually paid for Winamp when it was shareware. ahhhhh, those were the days! :D:D:D<br />
      I'd pay for NSIS too but it's freeware. :( (it saved me a LOT of money and I couldn't be happier with it)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would have to say ... the whole idea of "warezizing" a product that is free is completely stupid. Ironic even. If they could have found a piece of software that was worth pirating, then it would have been a good idea. But the fact that some dumb teenager placed that on his page, is very possible.<br />

      <p class="post-content">im just glad slate blue is popular enough to even be considered for piracy. maybe i will build a shareware scheme into it, just to see if it gets cracked. only registered users get the "secret" function(s).<br />
      <br />
      now i bet you want to know what the "secret" function(s) is/are...register and see.<br />

      <p class="post-content">That's true, they are mostly run by stupid kids. They don't have all freeware however. I noticed that Linux Mandrake isn't on there yet. The idiot who made the site probably has no idea that Linux is free. And it is beyond me why someone would be dumb enough to download a free program in order to put it on a "warez" site. It's pathetic. All warez sites are.</p>
