      <p class="post-content"><strong>Error creating uninstaller file?</strong><br />
      Hi there, I've been reading forum posts and google listings for weeks and I still can't figure out why the Uninstaller for my script is created sometimes and not created at other times.<br />
      <br />
      I'm struggling with understanding where the uninstall keys should be placed in the registry, so could it be related to using the following values for the registry?<br />
      <br />
      ;Default installation folder<br />
      InstallDir "$APPDATA\Prism"<br />
      InstallDirRegKey HKCU "Software\Prism" "Install_Dir"<br />
      ...<br />
      WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\Prism" "Install_Dir" INSTDIR<br />
      ...<br />
      WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}" "DisplayName" "${MUI_PRODUCT} (remove only)"<br />
      <br />
      When it is created, it is properly placed in the $INSTDIR but other times it just does not seem to be created.<br />
      <br />
      I even did a search on the hard disk to see if the file was being placed in a different folder. I do see a file called "UNINSTALL.EXE-079433DA.pf" being placed in the "Windows/Prefetch" folder. Googling that folder name doesn't help any.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>problem resolved!</strong><br />
      All is well!<br />
      <br />
      I had to create the directory that stored the uninstall program before I executed the WriteUninstaller command??<br />
      <br />
      Not sure if that is the correct procedure, and it's not in any of the documentation, but it worked for me!</p>
