I'm trying to use the LZMA compressor to compress a 10 GB file, but I know most of the file is empty space and it will compress down to 600MB.<br><br>Problem is I've started it compressing, and 8 hours later it's still going, with no indication of how long it will take. It seems it's trying to load the entire file into memory, and therefore the system is doing a lot of swapping, and I think it's going very slowly.<br><br>EDIT: I tried using the zli compressor, and whenever I give it a file igger then 705MB, it seems to just truncate it - I'll report ack the exact size that it truncates to when I get there.<br><br>PS.
