      <p class="post-content">You'd need a different logic for this one. Instead of turning off the current selected section and checking if another was selected you'd need to turn off just the section that was last selected if both are selected.</p>

      <p class="post-content">About the finish page link:<br />
      <br />
      With the next release (candidate) the link will no longer receive the initial keyboard focus. If you can't wait that long, the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip" target="_blank">nightly snapshot</a> will contain this fix within, at the most, 24 hours.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You need another logic such as:<br />
      <br />
      If 1 is selected and 2 was selected before, unselect 2.<br />
      If 2 is selected and 1 was selected before, unselect 1.<br />
      <br />
      That should do it, I think.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hello!<br />
      <br />
      it worked! thanks very much.<br />
      <br />
      a few more questions :<br />
      <br />
      1.<br />
      i am using the logiclib. i am using from it - if..else..endif. when i compile i get this warning :<br />
      <br />
      "Variable "_LOGICLIB_TEMP" not referenced, wasting memory!"<br />
      <br />
      i do not have that variable. its from logiclib. why it appears ? am i doing something the wrong way ?<br />
      <br />
      2.<br />
      in the uninstall components page i have "Space required: 0.0 KB" i think it should be something with a minus : "Space required: -123.0 KB".<br />
      <br />
      3.<br />
      i have a custom page made with install options. i have a checkbox and 3 radio buttons. how can i make the radio buttons to be enabled only when the checkbox is "checked" ?<br />
      <br />
      PS: i am using "Development snapshot (Wed, 07 Jan 2004)"<br />
      <br />
      thanks for helping !</p>

      <p class="post-content">1. A known issue, you can safely ignore it.<br />
      <br />
      2. You can use AddSize with a negative size or even get the installed sections' sizes on install time and set it with a minus on uninstall time using SectionGetSize and SectionSetSize. You can also simply hide that field using FindWindow, GetDlgItem and ShowWindow.<br />
      <br />
      3. See Contrib\InstallOptions\TestNotify.nsi for an example. In that examples it enables and disables a text field according to a check box but it disabling a radio doesn't require a change to the script (aside from the control id of course...).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi!<br />
      <br />
      I have the same problem exept I have a subsection with 6 sections:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Subsec<br />- Sec1<br />- Sec2<br />- Sec3<br />- Sec4<br />- Sec5<br />- Sec6<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Is there an easy way to create an macro like RadioButtons, that works like 'copy of one-section.nsi' that kichik posted? Otherwise the code is going to get VERY long with 6 sections...I think :p<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!
