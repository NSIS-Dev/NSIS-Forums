      <p class="post-content"><strong>Access extracted files? (Not what you think.)</strong><br />
      Hi.<br />
      <br />
      I am trying to figure out where NSIS saves temporary files it extracts while installing. I have an NSIS installer on my web site (<a href="http://www.deeplake.com/internet.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.deeplake.com/internet.shtml</a> - the setup program there) provided by a 3rd party. I would like to customise the program in some way (just by hex editing), but I need to get the uncompressed version first of all.<br />
      <br />
      This is not an installer in the traditional sense--it does not ask you where files should be put, and it doesn't even install a program. It just creates a dial up networking connection and that's it.<br />
      <br />
      So, how is NSIS doing this? Is it extracting a file, running it and then deleting it? I've tried killing it half way through and looking through TEMP dirs for a file, but no look. Or is all the functionality implemented in an NSIS script?<br />
      <br />
      Any help would be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">A example:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>Section<br /><br />  #Put other things here<br /><br />  InitPluginsDir<br />  SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />  File "Program.exe"<br />  ExecWait "$PLUGINSDIR\Program.exe"<br />  Delete "$PLUGINSDIR\Program.exe"<br /><br />  #Put other things here<br /><br />SectionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      The $PLUGINSDIR is a directory with different names each time run the installation, that is used to put temporary files (located in $TEMP directory). It is automatically deleted when you exit the installer. If it doesn't be deleted, try RMDir command after all.

      </blockquote>Thanks for you reply, however I think you have maybe misunderstood me. I am not writing an installer - I have a compiled installer provided by a 3rd party. I want to access the files that are extracted by the installer--that's all.<br />
      <br />
      Is there any way that this can be done?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>It depends on the script.
