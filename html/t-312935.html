Apparently there's a function called ExecAppFile that is never called. This function doesn't exist in UAC.nsh, so I doubt it is related to the UAC plugin. The problem is probably in your own code.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kripplet</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th September 2009 13:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">If you read the documentation on the UAC plug-in wikipage, then there it says to use this to run an application after the installer has finished:<br><br>!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN<br>!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_FUNCTION ExecAppFile<br><br>Function ExecAppFile<br>UAC::Exec '' '"$INSTDIR\${APPFILE}"' '' ''<br>FunctionEnd<br><br>That is why I use "ExecAppFile". It is indeed no function of UAC, but of UMUI.<br><br>And you're also correct that it isn't a EM but a warning. But it also says that it is zeroing out the code, which results in an installer which doesn't start up anything after it is finished.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Anders</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th September 2009 14:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">this has nothing to do with the uac plugin.
