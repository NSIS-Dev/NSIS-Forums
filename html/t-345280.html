      <p class="post-content"><strong>ShellEx macro</strong><br />
      i don't know where <a href="http://pastebin.com/3FeNdUwc" target="_blank">this macro</a> came from, i couldn't find it on the wiki or the forum. i'm pretty sure though i got it from someone here.<br />
      <br />
      so, i've been using this for some years now and never ran into a problem. from what i remember, this allowed me building an installer with user rights and whenever it runs an executable, it will display an elevation dialog if required by the executable.<br />
      <br />
      however, i've been told it won't work if the path or the executable contains a single quote. any ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content">That macro uses the SEE_MASK_NOCLOSEPROCESS (0x00000040) flag meaning that your code is leaking process handles. Other than passing the working directory as a parameter without having to use SetOutPath, this macro has no advantage over ExecShell...<br />
      <br />
      Edit: I'm guessing somebody that does not know what they are doing copied parts of <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellExecWait" target="_blank">this macro</a>. That macro has the same single quote issue but at least it provides some actual value over ExecShell...</p>

      </blockquote>i have no idea. as i said, this was recommended me to someone as i wanted to be able to execute a program with admin rights even if the installer runs with user rights only. from what i remember a simple exec didn't execute such a program, whereas this macro popped up an elevation dialog.

      </blockquote>A normal ExecShell will do that (ExecShell calls ShellExecute and Exec[Wait] calls CreateProcess)

      <p class="post-content">hm, i noticed when using <i>ExecShell runas</i> it only works with .exe files but .msi files will not open at all. is this a limitation by windows?</p>

      <p class="post-content">An MSI file is not an executable. You must use msiexec.exe.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: And why are you using runas exactly? You should just use RequestExecutionLevel (along with UserInfo) to ensure the installer is already elevated before any installation occurs.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Indeed, it always annoys me when installers install partly to all users/HKLM and partly to current user/HKCU. The rest of my family end up with partially installed/broken apps that they don't want.</p>
