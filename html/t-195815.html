The only plug-in I can think of that comes anywhere close to that area is the System plug-in. But I made sure it's DEP-safe years ago. Maybe you're using a very very old version (should be even pre 2.0, I think)?</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
