I have a strange problem that I was wondering if anyone could figure out. I have .exe files made from Matlab, which are 16 bit .exe's that open a command window then a GUI when executed. All I want to do is have Windows hide this command window. The name changes on different systems and on different calls, but it's always a DOS window, and I know nothing about finding HWNDs and hiding them. Here is NSIS code that at least runs one of these programs (though it still opens up a separate command window):<br><br></p><pre>
<code>Name "Help"<br>OutFile "bar.exe"<br><br>Section "foo"<br>  SetOutPath "c:\Program Files\Foo"<br>  ExecWait foo.exe<br>SectionEnd</code>
</pre><br>
      Pretty simple, I'm just wondering if there's a way to use NSIS's FindWindow and HideWindow commands for this extra popup. I tried this in C, and it usually works, but only when I know and enter the correct window title. I like and understand NSIS, and just thought I'd ask some experts :).

      <p class="post-content">I had no idea there's been so much discussion on this before. I had just given up trying to find a solution :). So, now I'm using<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>SetOutPath "c:\Program Files\foo"<br>  nsExec::Exec "cmd /C foo.exe"</code>
</pre><br>
      And I only have one question left. I want to make the working directory the program's installation directory (there are 2 exe's here, one for the install program, and this one). I assume this would include:<br>
      <br>
      ; Get the install directory created by the installer exe<br>
      ReadRegStr HKLM SOFTWARE\Foo "Install_Dir" $x<br>
      <br>
      But I don't know what other steps are needed to make this the working directory for nsExec. And I love NSIS, but I've learned all I can for one weekend and need help :).<br>
      <br>
      Actually, this exe file will be installed in the install directory, so would it automatically start with the correct working directory?

      <p class="post-content">You can use variables in command parameters. As in your example the command should look like<br>
      <br>
      SetOutPath "$x"<br>
      <br>
      or<br>
      <br>
      SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"<br>
      <br>
      as a global variable. This variable is set if you used the directory page</p>
