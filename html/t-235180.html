I have built installers very easily and am now building my own pages.<br><br>I have a question about how to do something though.<br><br>I want to bring up a page where a user enters a database name and a port ()2 fields) . They then hit next and this next page asks "configure another?". If they check yes then it calls back to the previous page (with the two fields). The code then stores all the data each time and later on generates the config files for each database.<br><br>I don't now how to do this. I have tried and I have the screens working but not the workflow as described.<br><br>alternatives:<br>a) I could configure a button "Configure Another" on the page but then I would like to add the previous details to a listbox showing the software has remebered the previous info and this would open up the possibility of removal functionality in future versions of the installer.<br><br>b) message box and then wipe the screen ready for rentry. I don't really like this at all.<br><br>Anybody able to help?<br><br>Regards,<br>John</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2006 20:13 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can use a leave callback function to store the data and ask the question. However, I think the first alternative is a better one. That can also be achieved using the leave callback function, but you'll also need the NOTIFY flag of InstallOptions. See Examples\InstallOptions\testnotify.nsi.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">yegger</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th January 2006 03:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Thanks a million, I got very far with this.
