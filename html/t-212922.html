      The release of Eclipse 3.1 has delayed my release, because of changes which have required me to port a lot of code from 3.0 to 3.1. On the plus side, 3.1 provides functionality which I had to previously code by hand, so I decided the upgrade was worth it.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br>
      I was hoping to get a hierarchical treeview of !included files in outline, current implementation is not really useful.<br>
      <br>
      Note, I'm not an Eclipse advocate, haven't used it for any Java development, but fiddled with the CDT plugin. What I'd like to see is something similar to Project View of CDT.<br>
      <br>
      I don't know if you'll ever implement a Project View for NSIS or even a NSIS Perspective, but before that I ponder over obtaining a hierarchical structure in Outline View (it *should* be possible because C structures are shown in treeview in Outline View of CDT).<br>
      <br>
      Basically, when I click an !include directive in Outline I'd like the corresponding file opened in editor. Also a plus sign should appear next to it, so that I could see its Outline view when expanded. As you build the tree of !include'd files, don't forget to parse !addincludedir directives in sources as well. Thanks<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I know this is not trivial, but if you do it, I believe your work will stand out from the rest.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Add this to the feature request list in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipsensis/" target="_blank">SourceForge page</a>.<br>
      But I can tell you right off the bat that this is not something that is going to come soon.<br>
      I have had it in on my to-do list, but before I look at it, I plan to rewrite my NSIS parser and object model so that:<br>
      a) I can optimize the processing of document changes.<br>
      b) Support advanced features of the kind you suggest.<br>
      Bear in mind that I do this in my spare time- I do have a "real" job which pays the bills so that I can afford to do this one for free.</p>

      Some things to try:<br>
      1) Uninstall the plugins and reinstall using the update site: <a href="http://eclipsensis.sf.net/update" target="_blank">http://eclipsensis.sf.net/update</a><br>
      2) Check the .log file in the your workspace .metadata folder and see if it is reporting any errors.<br>
      3) Run eclipse from the command line and specify -vm &lt;path to java&gt;\java.exe (This will print to the console any errors which are not reported in the .log file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Does Eclipse hang or is it just the button going gray?<br>
      Also, could you check via task manager whether the MakeNSIS process has been started?<br>
      If you get <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html" target="_blank">Process Explorer</a>, you can get the exact command line used to execute MakeNSIS.<br>
      Next, check whether a hidden window of window class "Hidden EclipseNSIS Window" has been created. You can check this using Microsoft Visual Studio Spy++ or <a href="http://www.catch22.net/software/winspy.asp" target="_blank">WinSpy++</a> .<br>
      What is the full path name of your Eclipse installation and what is the full path name of your script file?<br>
      Did you install the standard NSIS 2.09 distribution or some other one?<br>
      Did you accept the default installation type or did you change something in it? (I mean the installation types you see when you run the NSIS 2.09 installer).<br>
      I, too, really don't understand what is going on... hundreds of people have downloaded the plugin and not reported a problem like this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok. here i go...<br>
      <br>
      eclipse does not hang, but the compile button (after i press it) becomes grey and remains grey. if i minimize/restore eclipse it is enabled again.<br>
      in process explorer - only once makensis appeared. the first time i opened a script after installed eclipsensis. is was there only for a second. after that - nothing. the nsis installation is detected because if i change the path (in eclipsensis configuration), i get an error message.<br>
      in winspy - yes, there is a hidden window of window class "Hidden EclipseNSIS Window". what should i do with it ? :)<br>
      <br>
      full path of eclipse "c:\program files\eclipse". also tried "C:\eclipse"<br>
      full path to my script - not relevant. i tried from root dir and does not work.<br>
      <br>
      nsis - standard version and standard install.<br>

      <p class="post-content">The brief run of MakeNSIS means that EclipseNSIS is verifying the compiler version.<br>
      The fact that the button is reactivated when you minimize and maximize Eclipse means that MakeNSIS has been run successfully. Something seems to be going wrong while processing its results.<br>
      The hidden window is used by MakeNSIS to communicate with EclipseNSIS. If it is being created, try manually compiling the script using MakeNSIS and pass the /NOTIFYHWND HWND argument where HWND is the handle number of the hidden window in decimal format and see if the script compiles OK.<br>
      Does the EclipseNSIS console view display?<br>
      If not, can you open it using the views menu and see if any output is shown in it?<br>
      I'm sorry but I really don't understand what could be going wrong.<br>
      Are there any special permissions involved- e.g., are you not an admin on the computer.<br>
      Does this problem occur with every script or just one script?<br>

      <p class="post-content">I have the same problem.<br>
      <br>
      If you compile an independent script without opening a NSIS script from the workspace, the script won't compile. At this time, the "EclipseNSIS Console" window doesn't open. It also doesn't output anything, neither if you have the window open or closed.<br>
      <br>
      After the first time you open a NSIS script from the workspace, any NSIS script can be compiled normally, including independent NSIS scripts...<br>
      <br>
      If you close all documents, and open an independent NSIS script, then the same problem happens again.<br>
      <br>
      EDIT: The "Code Folding" feature doesn't work as well. It only works for scripts in the workspace.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ah, that explains it.<br>
      <br>
      This is not an EclipseNSIS bug. Eclipse does not provide access to all the cool editing features (folding, problem markers, etc.) for files which are not in an Eclipse project. Hence you will not see these features available when you open an external file in Eclipse. (It is the same for any Eclipse editor- check out the Java editor).<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, EclipseNSIS reads and writes certain attributes in a file which is compiled or edited using EclipseNSIS. However, because of the limitations of Eclipse, these attributes can only be set for files which are part of an Eclipse project. Hence, the normal compile and test functions of EclipseNSIS will not work for an external file. The file <b>HAS</b> to be part of an Eclipse project for EclipseNSIS to function properly.<br>
      <br>
      I am surprised that you are able to compile an external (independent) NSIS script since EclipseNSIS does not support this- it will not compile a file which is not in the Eclipse workspace- the currently released code simply will <b>NOT</b> do it.<br>
      <br>
      The next version of EclipseNSIS may support this- however you still will not get code folding or problem markers, etc.- Eclipse just doesn't provide these features for external files (I would have to rewrite most of the Eclipse editor from scratch- which is just not worth the time since it is much easier for the user to just create a new project).</p>

      <p class="post-content">EclipseNSIS 0.9.3 and EclipseNSIS InstallOptions Editor 0.9.3 are both available for download now.<br>
      See the <a href="http://eclipsensis.sf.net" target="_blank">EclipseNSIS home page</a> for details.<br>

      <b>Changes:</b><br>

      <u>EclipseNSIS</u></p>

      <ul>
        <li>External files are now supported- including compiling, testing, code folding and annotations.</li>

        <li>Other minor bug fixes.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <u>EclipseNSIS InstallOptions Editor</u>

      <ul>
        <li>Added support for Unknown control in design editor.</li>

        <li>Added distribution, locking actions to design editor.</li>

        <li>Added preview support in both source and design editors.</li>

        <li>Improved RTL support on Windows 2000 and better.</li>

        <li>Fixed Z-ordering of controls.</li>

        <li>External files are now supported- including code folding and annotations.</li>

        <li>Other minor bug fixes.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <b>Notes:</b><br>
      I was mistaken when I earlier said that Eclipse does not support annotations and folding for external files. While it is true that Eclipse does not support these features by default, it does provide the tools to build support for them. The result- most of the functionality for both EclipseNSIS and InstallOptions editor is avaialable for both external as well as internal (workspace) files. What is not available (obviously) is storing and retrieving custom compilation options for external files. This is only available for workspace files. External files will use the global compilation options set using the EclipseNSIS Preferences page.<br>
      <br>
      As always, I am looking for any and all bugs you may find. These may be entered in the EclipseNSIS project SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=116143&amp;atid=673849" target="_blank">Bug tracker</a>. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=673852&amp;group_id=116143" target="_blank">Feature requests</a> may also be entered.

        <p class="post-content">Hi,<br>
        I have several .nsh files !include'd, and happened to press Alt-C while editing one of them. Naturally the build failed and an error line popped up in Problems View.<br>
        And it's stuck, it does not go away, even if I compile the main .nsi successfully. How do I get rid of such dangling entries in Problems View? Is this view not cleared before every compile?</p>

        <p class="post-content">edit: now that I've spent a few more minutes thinking about it, there are plenty of situations where you <b>would</b> want the EclipseNSIS script generator to create an uninstall section, even for sections that are purely function-based. And I think it would take many thousands of more minutes to code logic for this issue than it would to just manually edit the generated template... and that time could better be spent on pretty much anything else that would be much more worthwhile. So I withdraw my post.<br>
        <br>
        I'd also like to add a huge <b>thank you</b> to all that are involved in the eclipseNSIS project, as well as everyone who has spent any time working on and improving NSIS, the WIKI, the documentation, the examples, the included contributions, etc. It is very much appreciated by many, including myself.<br>
        <br></p>

        <blockquote>
          One thing I noticed was that (maybe I'm wrong) when building a new install file from a template, EclipseNSIS does not allow me to create a section that does not install any files. By this I mean, I have a section or two that just does file manipulations. Download updates, perform version checks, etc etc etc. But I have to insert a dummy file for each section so that EclipseNSIS lets me continue with the template.<br>
          <br>
          Optimally, I'd prefer to somehow mark that section as "performs function operations", so I didn't have to tell it to install the dummy file. That, and if a section only performed functions, to not have it generate an uninstaller section for those particular sections.<br>
          <br>
          It's very a minor thing, but I thought I'd bring it up anyway.

        Unfortunately there is no easy way to clear the markers from your nsh file. What you can do is clear all the markers for the project it belongs to. To do this, navigate to:<br>
        &lt;Workspace&gt;\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\.projects\&lt;your project&gt; and delete the .markers file.<br>
        The next release will be fixed so that compile/test menus and shortcuts will ONLY be enabled for nsi files- not nsh files.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Jamyn</b>:<br>
        I understand what you are saying- however, creating sections which are not going to actually install something are beyond the scope of the Wizard- and frankly it would be kind of pointless as well. All you would really gain is avoiding having to type two lines ("Section" and "SectionEnd"). You should use the wizard to generate the base script and then customize it with all the bells and whistles you need.<br>
        Perhaps you could use the code templates to be able to quickly insert sections instead?<br>
        Also, thanks for the kind words. EclipseNSIS is something I created as much for myself as for the Eclipse/NSIS community. it was a personal itch I just had to scratch :-).</p>

        <p class="post-content">If I just download a nighly build (makensis /version works as expected) and try to set it as NSIS Home it shows me 'Invalid NSIS Home, MakeNSIS 2.0 required'. This is a new issue after upgrading to EclipseNSIS 0.9.3. Version 0.9.2 worked fine.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Strange. There is no significant difference in the version validation code between 0.9.3 and 0.9.2.<br>
        Can you check in the .log file if any error is being recorded?<br>
        If not, I may create a special debug build for you to use (and generate a log).<br>
        [edit]Has anything else changed on your end? Java VM, MakeNSIS path, MakeNSIS exe name, etc.?[/edit]</p>

        iceman_k, I usually add this view as a fast view to my perspective, especially in development versions. It's very unobtrusive, but still very useful.</p>

        <p class="post-content">I keep it docked with my other views. You can also configure the view to automatically activate upon new entries- also a useful feature.<br>
        The problem with this view, however, is that if your log has been rotated, you may miss some information. So while I use it, I prefer to dig into my workspace .metadata on occasion.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Since you are monitoring this thread, are you seeing the same issue as Joost &amp; Comm@nder21? Specifically- EclipseNSIS 0.9.3 does not accept CVS builds for the NSIS home.<br>
        Like I said, I have tried it on several OS's without a problem. The only possible thing I can think of is that it has something to do with the localization settings on the user's PC- though I feel that I have accounted for that as well.<br>
        Perhaps I will create a fragment build which logs the actions performed during version validation and distribute via this forum. The other option is remote debugging- but the performance on that is poor even with 2 computers right next to each other in the network- let alone on different continents!</p>

        <p class="post-content">OK, I was able to reproduce this problem. As I suspected, it was because of a localization issue. I will issue a patch fragment which will fix this problem.<br>
        What mystifies me is that this apparently worked in 0.9.1 and 0.9.2- even though the validation code has essentially not changed (the only difference was to log errors to the log file instead of the console).<br>
        <b>Update:</b> When Scons builds MakeNSIS.exe, it sets the version thus:<br></p>
        <pre>
<code><br>cvs_version = strftime('%d-%b-%Y.cvs', gmtime())<br></code>
</pre><br>
        <br>
        i.e., it uses the localized version of the month name. However, if you download the nightly build from the NSIS web site, the month name is in english- which may not match your locale. This causes the EclipseNSIS date parsing to fail- since it expects a localized version number.<br>
        Hence, I will modify the code to account for english as well as localized version numbers. In the meantime, if you rebuild MakeNSIS.exe on your local PC, EclipseNSIS should accept it.

        It will be available when Eclipse 3.2 is released- probably Q2 2006.<br>
        At that time EclipseNSIS will support it as well.

        <b>Notes:</b><br>
        The EclipseNSIS console has been refactored to use the standard Eclipse console. This has resulted in a significant performance boost while compiling.<br>
        The new NSIS update feature enables you to check for, download and install the latest NSIS software from within EclipseNSIS, either on demand or on a scheduled basis.<br>
        You can now configure NSIS scripts as launch configurations. What this means is that a set of compilation options for a NSIS script can be saved as an External Tool launch configuration with Eclipse. This way multiple configurations can be saved for the same script and can be accessed easily through the External Tools menu or toolbar item. Additionally, NSIS script can be saved as project builders, and can be configured to run when the project is built.<br>
        <br>
        As always, I am looking for any and all bugs you may find. These may be entered in the EclipseNSIS project SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=116143&amp;atid=673849" target="_blank">Bug tracker</a>. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=673852&amp;group_id=116143" target="_blank">Feature requests</a> may also be entered.

        <p class="post-content"><strong>EclipseNSIS 0.9.4 HOTFIX</strong><br>
        EclipseNSIS 0.9.4 HOTFIX<br>
        ========================<br>
        For whatever reasons, the way in which NSIS reports its version number was changed in NSIS 2.15.<br>
        This prevents EclipseNSIS from detecting that a valid version of NSIS is installed.<br>
        As a workaround, a hotfix JAR file is being provided on an interim basis. The hotfix can be downloaded from <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/eclipsensis/net.sf.eclipsensis_0.9.4-hotfix.zip?download" target="_blank">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/e...x.zip?download</a> .<br>
        Please note that that the hotfix DOES NOT support new syntactical elements in NSIS 2.15- specifically the new !if command and the modification to the !define command.<br>
        Other than that, it should work just fine.<br>
        <br>
        Installation Instructions:<br>
        ==========================<br>
        1. Close any running instances of Eclipse.<br>
        2. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the Eclipse plugins folder.<br>
        3. Backup the net.sf.eclipsensis_0.9.4.jar file.<br>
        4. Copy the net.sf.eclipsensis_0.9.4.jar file in the hotfix to the Eclipse plugins folder, overwriting the old version.<br>
        5. Restart Eclipse. The new version of NSIS should now be accepted.</p>

          <p class="post-content">I don't understand.<br>
          I use Eclipse 3.1.2, your plugin 0.9.4, this afternoon, I downloaded two times net.sf.eclipsensis_0.9.4.jar from 2 different mirrors, the timestamp of the jar is dated March 6th (and in the jar, NSISValidator.class too), but always the same problem, I don't know where is my mistake...<br>
          <br>
          I did a flashback (??? sorry, I'm french with a bad english, how you say in english when you install an old version?) and now it's ok, too tired to search.</p>

          <p class="post-content">Couple of things to try:<br>
          a) Start eclipse with -clean option (this clears the configuration cache).<br>
          b) Verify that Eclipse is indeed pointing to the correct plugins location, i.e. that there isn't a second plugins location with the old 0.9.4 jar. One way to do this: start Eclipse, access EclipseNSIS and then try to delete net.sf.eclipsensis_0.9.4.jar. If it lets you delete it, that means it is picking up the older version from somewhere else.<br>
          <br>
          One more question- are you using the standard or the French version of NSIS?</p>

          <p class="post-content"><strong>Invalid NSIS Home</strong><br>
          Hi,<br>
          <br>
          I was using EclipseNSIS succesfully last week - nothing on my PC has changed, however today when starting eclipse (or attempting to create a new NSIS script) I am prompted to configure NSIS and configure the path to MakeNSIS.exe - I've tried but I get the error:<br>
          <br>
          'Invalid NSIS Home'<br>
          <br>
          I have tried uninstalling everything and re-installing (with a clean eclipse startup), but it still doesn't work.<br>
          <br>
          I have the most recent EclipseNSIS plugin from the update manager (<a href="http://eclipsensis.sf.net/update" target="_blank">http://eclipsensis.sf.net/update</a>) and have obtained and installed the most recent NSIS install (nsis-2.15-setup.exe)..<br>
          <br>
          Any suggestions?<br>
          <br>
          Thanks,<br>

          <p class="post-content">What do you mean by "installtoptions just won't show up in the plugins"? Is it that you cannot use it to open INI files or it doesn't show up in the plugins list in the <i>Help-&gt;About</i> menu?<br>
          Some things to try:<br>
          a) Make sure you have installed GEF 3.1.<br>
          b) Open <i>Help-&gt;Software Updates-&gt;Manage Configuration</i> menu and check the status of the net.sf.eclipsensis.installoptions feature.<br>
          c) Check the error log and see if there are any messages indicating why the plugin did not start. The error log can be either seen using the Error Log view, or by opening the .log file in the .metadata folder in your workspace.<br>

          <br>
          The best way to install/update EclipseNSIS is by using the Eclipse Updates Manager. It ensures that all prerequisites are met before you can install the plugins. Downloading and unzipping does not guarantee that the plugins will work, especially if some other necessary plugin is missing.</p>

          </blockquote>To open the view, use the <i>Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Error Log</i>.<br>
          If that menu item is not available, try <i>Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...</i>. The wizard that opens should have a folder named "PDE Runtime" (I am assuming you did a complete Eclipse SDK installation). That folder should have any entry named "Error Log".<br>
          To read the log directly, you have to know where your Eclipse workspace folder is. Within that folder will be a subfolder named .metadata which, in turn, will contain a file named .log<br>

          </blockquote>It's no different from how you would open an editor for a Java file, a text file or any other file in Eclipse.<br>
          If you have a workspace with projects set up, then either double-click on an .NSI file or use the EclipseNSIS wizard to create a new one.<br>
          Or you can open any .NSI file on your computer using the File-&gt;Open menu item.<br>
          Remember to install the hotfix to get past the MakeNSIS 2.15 version number issue.<br>

          A couple of reasons for it:<br>
          1) I have been traveling for 3 of the last 5 weeks on my "real" job (the one that pays the bills).<br>
          2) This is the most rigorous testing cycle I have ever performed, and it is turning up a lot of little things that I had missed earlier or broken during the current development cycle.<br>
          Rest assured that I am still putting in at least a couple of hours a day testing and fixing the application. I still hope to get it out by the end of the month.</p>

            <b>Notes:</b><br>
            Java 6 is now officially supported. Windows Vista is nominally supported, but I have not tested it on this platform, since I do not have it installed. Support for Windows 98 &amp; ME is deprecated in this version and will be removed in the next version because of stability issues.<br>
            <br>
            As always, I am looking for any and all bugs you may find. These may be entered in the EclipseNSIS project SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=116143&amp;atid=673849" target="_blank">Bug tracker</a>. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=673852&amp;group_id=116143" target="_blank">Feature requests</a> may also be entered.

            <p class="post-content">Awesome! Is it possible to tune-up bitmap controls a bit? For example shift bitmap icon a bit to the left/right to unhidden digits showing size when dragging borders. Maybe even display actual bitmap (specified in text label) instead of an icon? But the first thing I would ask is to enable these bitmaps in preview - perhaps it just the matter of copying them along with preview script in temp directory.</p>

            You see, the TEXT property of the bitmap refers to the location of the bitmap on the <b><i>target</i></b> system- so if you are setting its value to a local file name on your system, you are making a mistake.

            <br>
            The logic seems to be pretty simple for previewer - the only problem is to remind user to extract the bitmaps to $PLUGINSDIR as needed.

            <p class="post-content">However, how can EclipseNSIS know which .nsi file the .ini file will be used with? The same .ini file can be used with potentially unlimited number of .nsi files.<br>
            Also, it is possible that the image file for the bitmap is not part of the installer, e.g., it is already present on the target system or it will be downloaded from some web site, etc. So, it is unlikely that what you are asking will ever happen. However, since (I assume) the developer is actually testing the installer before releasing it, (s)he will see that the bitmap file is missing and correct the problem accordingly.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Indeed, EclipseNSIS can't figure out what .nsi is used to display given .ini, but it could parse .nsi files, detect all included .ini and then walk through bitmaps and throw a warning (suppressable) if the file referenced in bitmap is not included in .nsi or extracted to plugins dir. Is that possible?<br>
            <br>
            Just for testing design I wish I knew Java to make a patch to cover my basic scenario when .bmp files referenced from .ini are included in preview .nsi file to be unpacked in $PLUGINSDIR later and displayed during preview. How can I iterate over the list of bitmaps in .ini and run a filter just before preview .ini will be processed?</p>

            <p class="post-content">I had discussed this with Deguix about a year or so ago.<br>
            The problems I have faced in the past are:<br>
            a) InstallOptionsEx is changing all the time- i.e., there is not yet a stable final release.<br>
            b) It is very buggy (at least the last time I looked at it).<br>
            <br>
            If a stable and final release can be made, then I will consider it.<br>
            I understand that in the lifecycle of any product there will be enhancements, changes, etc. However, IOEx was evolving to rapidly for me to consider it.</p>

            <p class="post-content">$PLUGINSDIR does not exist until the installer is run on the end-user's machine. It is different everytime the installer is run. So it cannnot be resolved or validated on the developer's machine. I think you are missing the difference between <b>RUNTIME</b> and <b>COMPILETIME</b>.<br>
            Also, it doesn't have to be $PLUGINSDIR- it can be anywhere on the end-user's machine. <b>NOT</b> on the developer's machine.<br>
            That is the last I am going to say on this subject. Unfortunately, the feature you are want is not going to happen (at least in the near future), because it is impractical to implement at this time.<br>
            It is much easier for the developer to validate that the bitmaps exist by simply compiling and running the installer.<br>
            <br>
            0.9.5.1 should be available in a week or so, if all goes well.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Hello,<br>
            <br>
            First of all let me say - great job ! I really like the new version of EclipseNSIS.<br>
            <br>
            One question (not really related to NSIS) - How do I associate ".nsi" extension with Eclipse ? I tried manually but it does not work.<br>
            If I enter - "path to eclipse\eclipse.exe" "%1" - as the command for "open" action, Eclipse is launched but no file is opened.<br>
            <br>
            Thanks.</p>

            <p class="post-content">:( :( :(<br>
            <br>
            I updated my Eclipse and EclipseNSIS today, and where everything worked fine before i now have a problem "compiling".<br>
            <br>
            When i now open any of my .nsi files i am not presented with the option of "CompileScript" in the EclipseNSIS menu, it is greyed out.<br>
            <br>
            If i create a new .nsi file using EclipseNSIS Script Wizard it works fine , until i close Eclipse, when i reopen the file i have the same behaviour as stated above....<br>
            <br>
            I know this probably only is a configuration issue, but i don't get where i go wrong.<br>
            <br>
            Any help or "being pointed in the right direction" would be much appreciated.<br>
            <br>

            I downloaded all the Items again (Java (5.11 / 6u2), Nsis, Eclipse, EclipseNSIS (0.9.5.1 AND 0.9.6) and tried it again on my machine. I also tried it on a brand new VMWare XP Prof SP1 English. Nothing it shows the same behaviour as described above.<br>
            <br>
            Here is what i do<br>
            <br>
            1. Install Java<br>
            2. Install NSIS<br>
            3. Install Eclipse<br>
            4. Install EclipseNSIS and GEF 3.3.0<br>
            <br>
            am i missing anything ?<br>
            <br>
            :( and all because i only wanted to draw my custom pages instead of editing an ini file :(<br>
            <br>

              However, in an attempt to reproduce your problem, I set up an Windows XP SP2 German installation.<br>
              I then installed Sun JRE 1.5.0-12, NSIS 2.29, Eclipse 3.3, GEF 3.3 and EclipseNSIS 0.9.6.<br>

              </blockquote>You are looking for things that don't exist. There is no NSIS perspective nor is there any such thing as an NSIS project.<br>
              What you will find, however, is an NSIS Script Wizard which you can use to create new NSIS scripts.<br>
              Alternatively, you can open an existing NSIS script using the File-&gt;Open menu item.<br>
              If you have an NSIS file in an existing Eclipse project, you should be able to double click on it to open it.<br>
              The EclipseNSIS menu will show up once an NSIS script has been opened in the NSIS editor.<br>

              <br>
              One thing though. When I get a compilation error and click on it in the console a new copy of the file with the error in it is opened, even if it's already opened in Eclipse. I think it would be better if it would just jump to the line with the error in the already opened file.<br>
              <br>

              At least, not that I know of.<br>
              You can add your nsi file to any Eclipse project.<br>
              If you don't have an Eclipse project, you can create a new Project and set its location to be that of your nsi file.</p>

              </blockquote>Yeah, that's why I got confused... When I'm going to write something in Java I choose "File-&gt;New-&gt;Project-&gt;Java Project". When I'm going to write something in C++ I go "File-&gt;New-&gt;Project-&gt;C++ Project". So naturally I went looking for a "Installer Project" or "NSIS Project" but couldn't find anything... I found a "General Project", guess I can use that...

              I used Eclipse with NSIS this afternoon, creating an InstallOptions page with the editor.I finished it,tested,and it was ok.Now when I try to open it,create a new InstallOptions page, or even open the InstallOptions editor,it throws me an error,and goes to the source editor.I also can't preview the file.<br>

              <br>
              I also want to use NSIS in my Eclipse IDE. But before i should know wether I can use NSIS with user input(point out to a special directy e.g.) in the installer which i can write into my already existing .XML file.<br>
              <br>
              I have also googeled about NSIS + xml but found several plugins? Do they work together with NSIS-eclipse and which one to use is best?</p>

              <p class="post-content">Hi<br>
              <br>
              I don't exactly know what you are asking. If it is equal to:<br>
              <br>
              "I want to do something with an XML file using NSIS and am afraid that EclipseNSIS doesn't support it"<br>
              <br>
              I can say: Eclipse is just being used as IDE, referring to standard makensis.exe when building the installer. That means, feel free to use it. In fact im writing an installer that reads/writes an XML file as well.<br>
              <br>
              The next question was:<br>
              <br>
              "Which is the best XML plug-in for NSIS?"<br>
              <br>
              You are right, there are several ones...<br>

              <br>
              I use this one:<br>
              <br>
              <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/XML_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/XML_plug-in</a><br>
              <br>
              I suggest to take a look at the features and the trade-offs of all of them, then decide which one to try.<br>

              </blockquote>Every time you save the script, the internal model representing the script structure is completely refreshed. When this happens, Eclipse automatically expands all collapsed regions.<br>
              This does not happen if an incremental refresh is done of the model.<br>
              However, because of the complexity of NSIS scripts, I have not implemented incremental refreshes yet.<br>
              <br>
              If you would like to see the collapsed regions stay as such when you save a script, file a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?atid=673852&amp;group_id=116143" target="_blank">feature request</a> and I will get around to it when I can.

              Hello,<br>
              <br>
              It is told on EclipseNSIS revision history page (<a href="http://eclipsensis.sourceforge.net/revisions.shtml" target="_blank">http://eclipsensis.sourceforge.net/revisions.shtml</a>) that 0.9.7.3 version of EclipseNSIS was released on 10/06/2009.<br>
              <br>
              I need this version because EclipseNSIS stopped working when I moved from 32bit Vista to 64bit Windows 7, and they say that support for Windows 7 was added.<br>
              <br>
              However, I can only download 0.9.7.2 from update site and sf.net download pages. Was the update ever released? How can I get it?<br>
              <br>
              Since I did not find any contact information on eclipsensis.sourceforge.net site, I will be grateful if you just suggest me the way to contact EclipseNSIS developers.<br>

                After a long hiatus, EclipseNSIS 0.9.8.1 and EclipseNSIS InstallOptions Editor 0.9.8.1 are both available for download now.<br>
                See the <a href="http://eclipsensis.sf.net" target="_blank">EclipseNSIS</a> home page for more information about EclipseNSIS.<br>

                Notes:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>This is a minor release which adds full support for Java 7 and Oracle Java VMs.</li>

                  <li>There is a known issue with the Java 7 Hotspot VM which causes the Lucene Porter Stemmer to crash.<br>
                  Lucene is used by EclipseNSIS to index the NSIS help documentation.<br>
                  See:<br>

                  <br>
                  The workaround for this is to add the following line below the -vmargs line in C:\eclipse\eclipse.ini:<br>
                  -XX:-UseLoopPredicate</li>

However, please be aware that real life has a nasty habit of intruding into open source (i.e., unpaid) work, hence it may be a while before I get around to making any significant changes to the product.<br>

                <p class="post-content">It looks like your environment is not configured correctly.<br>
                As NSIS Wizard in Eclipse works fine for me (exactly the same version) we can assume this situation is not caused by NSIS, so you should look for error in your environment, machine or simply in parameters you put into Wizard.</p>
