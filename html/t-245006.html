I recently noticed symantec pop up indicating 2 counts of DOWNLOAD TROJAN deleted, and below that was another...action was partial .....location is C:\Documents and Settings\Dylan\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\0DMRG1YV\........status: infected, primary action: clean security risk, action: quarantine was partially successful.<br>I immidately bought spysweeper and ran a scan finding tracking adware cookies..I still have access to my firewall, I've ran a full scan in safe mode without any findings. The only thing I've noticed is a tracking cookie's (which is constantly being blocked by webroot spyweeper) . I've attempted deleting the location of the file but I still get tracking cookies.<br>I've ran avg antivirus, macafee, and spyware doc scans without finding a trojan. (all programs are removed I know it's bad to have multiple sofware) IS my computer infected with a trojan? oh yeah, syamntec stated the filename of the trojan as YUpacENVVXl0Sm9BQUNQeFhtb0FBQUR3[1].wmf</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th April 2006 10:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hi,<br>probably this forum is not the right place for this post.<br>Anyway, it seems that a web place that you're visiting often gives you the problem. Also could be either a toolbar for IE, or a BHO, or other activex addon. The wmf is an image format file stored in IE temporary folder. Why don't you just start using Firefox? It is nice, faster and far far away safest. :-)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">galil</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th April 2006 11:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Or better yet, Opera.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
