Well it's complicated.<br><br>Once upon a time, long ago in a galaxy far away, I noticed that winamp's install had changed, it now used superPIMP technology. I had used PiMP for my plugins, and needed something more meaty for installing Skinmaster. Unfortunatley I was broke, so I wasn't going to fork out for something huge, bloated, overpowered and hard to learn like InstallShield. I found some shit to make my own system and started work, it was hard, so I gave up, I found an open source system, and that was hard to use too.<br><br>So I mentioned to Cody (Used to do Denny's job, and provided me hosting for Skinmaster) to ask Justin if he was gonna release SuperPIMP. Justin said it sounded like a good idea (thro Cody), and nothing happened.<br><br>Then one day Cody mailed me to say NSIS .9 (or someother early version was out) and I fell in luv. It rocked.<br><br>What was NSIS at this time? <i>"NSIS tries to be a scriptable win32 installer/uninstaller system that doesn't suck and isn't huge."</i> It didn't suck. It was a little limited, but the learning curve for scripting it was WAY short.<br><br>Good things about 1.0x and 1.1x was it was simple to write a script, it wasn't overfeatured, it rocked. It did enough. If you wanted more, write a tiny exe to go in one of the sections to do the power stuff. Version Beta 18 of Skinmaster I think had an exe in to do stuff NSIS couldn't do at that time. It may still have (it's months since I touched that project)<br><br>Yeah there are loads of great things going in (I'm using 1.2x right now cos I haven't been able to keep up with the updates!) but the more that goes in the harder it is for a newbie, it's gonna get to the point it's as inpenetrable as Install Shield, perhaps more so as Install Shield has wizards and stuff.<br><br>This is a plea for restraint! Keep NSIS as an easy to use, simple to script installer, don't give it so many bells and whistles that it will be beyond mere mortals use.<br><br>Or if you want to add all this in, then do 2 versions perhaps, a lite and a beasty version. Lite should be enough for most people I think.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deep-Trouble</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th April 2001 13:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yeah I agree with Mike .. as he has said NSIS is getting complicated day by day.

If you don't want to use new features because you think it makes it "too complicated", then just stick with the version you are using now and don't go download a new release. Just edit the CONFIG.H file and be done with it. I don't think you should be criticizing people who want to spend their own time adding features that they think are useful to open source code.<br><br>In the future, I hope NSIS becomes even more robust than any of the commercial installers out there, with a myriad of GUI's and ways of doing things that are all optional and open source. In the future, NSIS will probably be very easy for a casual user to use by running a simple wizard or using some GUI not unlike that of some of the commercial installers. The difference is that it will still be open source, and that you aren't forced to use any one particular way of doing something. If you want to still edit the script directly, you will be able to. If you want to just create a quick no-nonsense install with a wizard, you will be able to. And if you just have to have some additional feature that the installer does not possess, then you can even add to the source code of the installer. That is the beauty of the NSIS.<br><br>And if you just want the features that are out now without any future updates, nothing is stopping you from just using the current installer without ever downloading a new version... although I doubt you will do that.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Koen van de Sande</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th April 2001 20:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I don't mind new features - as long as they are useful and don't make NSIS too big.

I haven't checked lately, but I think both the EXE header is smaller, and the data it compresses is compressed more efficiently.</li><li>The complexity of writing scripts hasn't gone up, with the exception of requiring Sections be ended, and the default section to be created. The reason sections have to be ended is just for error reduction sake, it would be too easy to screw up. So the only new requirements in an NSIS script since 1.0j is possibly having to add a line 'Section' and a one or more 'SectionEnd's.</li><li>additionally, in 1.4 beta 2, you cannot put the header modifications commands inside of sections. while this might be considered an added complexity, it makes scripts much more readable and keeps you from making assumptions of how things work (i.e. trying to make 'Name' depenedent on the script).</li><li>All of the other new features are NOT NECESSARY. They are purely optional.</li><li>Many of the new features, such as the label system for gotoing, are MUCH less complicated and easier to understand. Goto MyLabel is a lot easier to understand than Jump 2, IMO, especially if you wonder how many instructions a command takes (0, 1, or more?).</li><li>Things having to do with the error flag, DLL version checking, file date comparing, you are not required to use. They are just there in case you need them to be.</li></ul><br>Having said that, I must weigh in my views on an InstallShield type wizard or whatnot. Other people are welcome to do such things, but I personally don't see that as the direction.<br><br>"NSIS tries to be a scriptable win32 installer/uninstaller system that doesn't suck and isn't huge."<br><br>I don't say anything about learning curves in there, and that's for a reason. NSIS should be powerful. NSIS should be relatively easy to use, once you get the hang of it. Perhaps the documentation needs massive updates to help people get started faster. I am in big favor of this.<br><br>To finalize what I mean<ul><li>NSIS will continue to become more and more powerful, without sacrificing the ease of creating small scripts (except where absolutely necessary or very benificial, i.e. having to use SectionEnd), and without getting large (i.e. having an EXE header size of &lt; 40k).</li><li>More than anything, NSIS really needs updated documentation, that lets people slowly get into the structure of writing scripts. So they can start with writing to the NSIS 0.9 feature-set, then eventually add more as they become more comfortable with it. We need an open documentation project. Heh.
