      <br>
      Ah yes, that should work as well, and cleans up all the various NOTIFY's for *all* the dialogs all at once!<br>
      <br>
      Last night, I was worried about changing Notification(), as I only have started working on the code since last night.<br>
      I didn't know what ramifications changing that #define might have on the rest of the code!<br>
      <br>
      Also,<br>
      I am trying to use your code dump, and I don't have "fopen_s", I am assuming that must in a new lib that ships with VS 2005?<br>

      <br>
      The 2 problems you still have pending...<br>
      <br>
      Are you sure they are InstallOptionEx problems?<br>
      <br>
      You are using SetCtlColors, which is a function provided by the base NSIS Installer, right?<br>
      <br>
      Looking at InstallOptionEx, it sure doesn't look like it does much deaking with Group Boxes...<br>
      <br>
      Maybe you can avoid using SetCtlColors, and instead just call the needed things directly by using System/calls directly into the OS...<br>

      &gt;I have a property page object with a groupbox on it. I want to be able<br>
      &gt;to set the background color of the groupbox on the fly. The point of<br>
      &gt;this is to output examples of text settings (font, foreground color,<br>
      &gt;background color) in the groupbox.<br>
      <br>
      &gt;I cannot figure out how to set the background color of the entire<br>
      &gt;groupbox. Any hints would be very much appreciated.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Groupbox controls don't HAVE a background colour - they are just a "frame"<br>
      with a transparent interior. One solution would be to put an empty static<br>
      text control on the dialog, then put the groupbox on top of it. Set the<br>
      colour of the static control in the usual way.</p>

      I am sure they are InstallOptionEx problems because the SetCtlColors work fine with the original InstallOption GroupBox and Link controls.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, It must be possible to make it work with IOEx.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi SuperPat,<br>
      <br>
      I will take a look deeper into your problem.<br>
      <br>
      Couple things about the source...<br>
      <br>
      1) Using Visual Studio 6, I get this error:<br>
      c:\nsis\installoptionsex2.4.5b2_2007-02-14\contrib\installoptionsex\installeroptions.cpp(2120) : error C2374: 'nIdx' : redefinition; multiple initialization<br>
      c:\nsis\installoptionsex2.4.5b2_2007-02-14\contrib\installoptionsex\installeroptions.cpp(252) : see declaration of 'nIdx'<br>
      <br>
      I just went and cleaned it up by changing it to nIdx2 on line 2120, as well as in that for() loop.<br>
      <br>
      2) This one is minor, but it sure would be nice. =)<br>
      I don't seem to have COLOR_MENUHILIGHT defined in my headers, so I tacked this in the .h file right below<br>
      the #ifndef USER_TIMER_MINIMUM section:<br>
      <br>
      #ifndef COLOR_MENUHILIGHT<br>
      #define COLOR_MENUHILIGHT 29<br>
      #endif<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the fopen_s()...<br>
      I am wondering if you could ifdef that one by having it as a regular fopen() for anyone using anything less than VS 2005...<br>
      If not, no biggie, I just keep having to change it back to fopen() all the time. =)<br>

      After spending a considerable amount of time trying to track down your GroupBox problem, I am getting pretty convinced that it can't be something in the "GroupBox" handling, or lack of handling...<br>
      <br>
      I am now starting to think that maybe its parent window is causing the problem.<br>

      <br>
      Spy++ ships with VS 6, and presumably VS 2005 as well.<br>
      <br>
      You run it, and then tell it what "Window" to watch,<br>
      by dragging the "pointer" to the window we care about.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, I drag it to the window with the text of "This is a group box with a..."<br>
      (Class of a Button).<br>
      (Window 20600 for this run)<br>
      <br>
      Here are the messages I get when I "hide" the window, then bring the window back to the foreground, which should cause it to redraw everything.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hi SuperPat.<br>
      <br>
      I have found/fixed your problem!<br>
      <br>
      Go to ReadSettings().<br>
      <br>
      Look for this code:<br>
      // Remove FLAG_CUSTOMDRAW_TEMP flag only when the user<br>
      // specifies any of the color commands.<br>
      switch(pField-&gt;nType)<br>
      {<br>
      case FIELD_LABEL:<br>
      case FIELD_LINK:<br>
      case FIELD_TEXT:<br>
      case FIELD_LISTBOX:<br>
      case FIELD_COMBOBOX:<br>
      {<br>
      pField-&gt;nFlags |= FLAG_CUSTOMDRAW_TEMP;<br>
      break;<br>
      }<br>
      }<br>
      <br>
      If we add:<br>
      case FIELD_GROUPBOX:<br>
      <br>
      To the switch, this fixes the problem.<br>
      <br>
      Hopefully this fixes most (all?) of your problems, so that a new version of UMUI can get released!<br>
      <br>
      (I am *really* looking forward to it!)<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hi SuperPat,<br>
      <br>
      And another fix for your "Transparent" Link problem.<br>
      <br>
      (ie, the one where if you have transparent on, it displays the background of the link in white)<br>
      <br>
      The code is just not taking into account that the transparent mode is already on.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, go to:<br>
      <br>
      if (lpdis-&gt;itemAction &amp; ODA_DRAWENTIRE)<br>
      <br>
      To this line:<br>
      // Draw Background on the whole control<br>
      if(crBgColor != 0xFFFFFFFF)<br>
      <br>
      And change it to be:<br>
      <br>
      // Draw Background on the whole control<br>
      if(crBgColor != 0xFFFFFFFF &amp;&amp; GetBkMode(lpdis-&gt;hDC) != TRANSPARENT) {<br>
      <br>
      Scott</p>

      <span class="post-time small text-muted">20th February 2007 20:13 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p>

      <p class="post-content">And finally,<br>
      <br>
      After that change, the "link" text has a weird "white" shadow effect purposely put around the characters in the link.<br>
      This is just plain strange looking, and I suspect it should NOT be done when in TRANSPARENT mode...<br>
      <br>
      So this code:<br>
      <br>
      if(crTxtShwColor != 0xFFFFFFFF) {<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      // Draw Shadow Text<br>
      ++rc.left;<br>
      ++rc.right;<br>
      ++rc.top;<br>
      ++rc.bottom;<br>
      SetTextColor(lpdis-&gt;hDC, crTxtShwColor);<br>
      <br>
      DrawText(lpdis-&gt;hDC, pField-&gt;pszText, -1, &amp;rc, DT_EXPANDTABS | DT_WORDBREAK | (pField-&gt;nTxtAlign == ALIGN_TEXT_LEFT ? DT_LEFT : 0) | (pField-&gt;nTxtAlign == ALIGN_TEXT_CENTER ? DT_CENTER : 0) | (pField-&gt;nTxtAlign == ALIGN_TEXT_RIGHT ? DT_RIGHT : 0));<br>
      <br>
      // Draw Normal Text<br>
      --rc.left;<br>
      --rc.right;<br>
      --rc.top;<br>
      --rc.bottom;<br>
      }<br>
      <br>
      Probably should be changed to be like<br>
      if(crTxtShwColor != 0xFFFFFFFF &amp;&amp; GetBkMode(lpdis-&gt;hDC) != TRANSPARENT) {<br>
      <br>

      <p class="post-content">Hi SuperPat,<br>
      <br>
      I think you forgot to set up a NOTIFY:<br>
      Put this in your .ini file for each of those BUTTON controls:<br>
      <br>
      Notify=ONCLICK<br>
      <br>
      This isn't ideal either tho, cuz it will still call into our "validate" function, which we really don't want.<br>
      <br>
      You probably want to muck around with having the<br>
      Notify=ONCLICK in the .ini file,<br>
      but process it differently in the dll.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Hello,<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, when we add the Notify=ONCLICK on the button field, the dialog appear, but I don't want that it calls the leave function because it is not very clean.<br>
      <br>
      This is why it would really have to be modified the DLL so that it do not need Notify=ONCLICK to show File/Dir.. dialogs<br>
      <br>
      An other problem found with the FileDialog:<br>
      The filter key contain<br>
      Filter=Poop Files|*.poop|All files|*.*<br>
      The filter is constructed by putting pairs of entries together, each item separated by a | character. The first value in each pair is the text to display for the filter. The second value is the pattern to use to match files.<br>
      But it doesn't work, I have only one entry and his name is <i>Poop Files|*.poop|All files|*.*</i><br>
      Obviously, It does not have succeeds in cutting out the pairs...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi SuperPat,<br>
      <br>
      This one is pretty tough...<br>
      <br>
      I can "capture" the drawing by going to:<br>
      <br>
      case WM_DRAWITEM:<br>
      <br>
      And changing:<br>
      <br>
      if(pField-&gt;nType == FIELD_LABEL || pField-&gt;nType == FIELD_LINK) {<br>
      <br>
      to:<br>
      <br>
      if(pField-&gt;nType == FIELD_LABEL || pField-&gt;nType == FIELD_LINK || pField-&gt;nType == FIELD_BUTTON) {<br>
      <br>
      But it doesn't really draw it right...<br>
      But we do get "..." which is more than we got before...<br>
      <br>
      Hopefully this can help you track it down more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">SuperPat,<br>
      BTW, there is obviously an interaction problem with it and your skinnedbutton plugin.<br>
      If I yank the skinnedbutton from your test, the buttons get drawn right.<br>
      Maybe the fix here is as simple as sending a message to the skinnedbutton to redraw itself...<br>
      (This obviously should be happening automagically, but maybe thats the bug, that IOEX isn't sending it.)<br>

      Another test I did.<br>
      Get rid of all your color changing stuff from the test2 script.<br>
      <br>
      Even with doing that, the 2 pushbuttons don't show up.<br>
      <br>
      The only way I can get them to show up, is if I get rid of<br>
      the skinnedbutton calls, so that the regular buttons get used.<br>

        <blockquote>
          That too should be on the project page. It's the centralized place for ioex development. I'm sure deguix will not mind giving you access so you can upload the fixes there as well.
        </blockquote>Unbelievable as it may be seen, I thought about this yesterday, but I forgot about it. I now assigned full rights to SuperPat.<br>
        <br>
        I can also help you with development, but sincerely, I can't stand coding in C++...

        <p class="post-content">I updated the project file releases. Now it shows all SuperPat's versions merged into beta package (2.4.5 beta 1) and alpha package (2.4.5 beta 2 alpha 1-6 -&gt; I named your builds as alphas there). Also, I updated the InstallOptionsEx page at the nsis.sf.net to reflect this. I don't like to update CVS when there's only few people working on project (yields 1 as I still don't want to come back to development). If there's anything wrong with all this, just ask me.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Changelog (2.4.5 beta 2 alpha 7 7/Apr/2007):</b><br>
        # From now, it is an official version.<br>
        # Added: setFocus dll function: Set the focus on the specified control in parameter. It was designed to be used in your leave script functions. Prefer to use the FOCUS flag if you can.<br>
        # The compilation option USE_FOPEN_S was renamed in USE_SECURE_FUNCTIONS (in VisualStudio 2005 only)).<br>
        # Fixed: Applied IO Patch that kill some compiler warnings under Linux and mingw32.<br>
        # Fixed: Use installer's name for message boxes (IO patch #1661677).<br>
        # Size optimization: msdn now says SHGetMalloc returns the same allocator CoTaskMemFree uses and a little debugging backs this even on Windows 95.<br>

        <p class="post-content">I just realized that, as of NSIS 2.42, InstallOptionsEx will fail if used as a drop-in replacement of the existing InstallOptions. The new MUI header no longer uses the /NOUNLOAD flags, thus causing crashes with InstallOptionsEx which has not been updated to take advantage of the new API.<br>
        <br>
        I understand there will be no further updates to InstallOptionsEx, and moving to nsDialogs is encouraged, just dropping this note here (will also adjust the wiki) for the record.</p>

        <p class="post-content">I will release a new version 2.4.5 b2 (not alpha) of the plugin this week-end with a lot of bug fixes.<br>
        Two versions of the DLL will be released, a legacy version and a version using the new NSIS plugin API. The last one can be use as replacement of InstallOptions for ModernUI with NSIS 2.42 and more.</p>
