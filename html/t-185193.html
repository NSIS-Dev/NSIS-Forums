      Hi i am a newbie to programing and I am currently a student who has been posted to a company for attachment. My task in this company is to create an installation disk for one of its applications. First I have to create an installer to install a small batch file. It is a HelloWorld class which i created using java. But i have no idea how to package it into an installer. I have read the NSIS manual and have gone through the forum but don't understand most of the stuff there as the only programming knowledge I have is of Java. I hope you could give me some examples on how to make an installer for a batch file. Thanks!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can find scripts that help you inside <i>Examples</i> folder inside your NSIS dir, however I recommend looking inside <i>Examples\Modern UI</i> as the Modern UI adds more beauty to your installers.<br />
      <br />
      The simplest installer you can create is this below:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>OutFile a.exe<br /><br />Section<br />SectionEnd</code>
</pre>

      <p class="post-content">See what each of the scripts in the NSIS\Examples folder does. It's very easy to adapt an existing script. Also try the great wizard that comes with <a href="http://hmne.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://hmne.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey it's me again. I have a question regarding one of the examples given in the NSIS examples folder. This is from example2. Here's the code:<br />
      <br />
      Section "Example2 (required)"<br />
      <br />
      SectionIn RO<br />
      <br />
      ; Set output path to the installation directory.<br />
      SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
      <br />
      ; Put file there<br />
      File "..\makensisw.exe"<br />
      <br />
      For the last line (File "..\makensisw.exe"), is the makensisw.exe a file that already exists, one that will be created by the installer or is it the file that i would like to include in my installer.<br />
      <br />
      And also to change the directory of $INSTDIR i think i need to use StrCpy but i am not sure how to use it. Could someone give me an example on how to do this.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again!</p>

      <blockquote>
        is the makensisw.exe a file that already exists, one that will be created by the installer or is it the file that i would like to include in my installer.
      </blockquote>It is a file that already exists, and the file that you would like to include in your installer:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code>  <i>Quote from <b>example2.nsi</b>:</i><br />  ; Set output path to the installation directory.<br />  SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />  <br />  ; Put file there<br />  File "..\makensisw.exe"</code>
</pre><br />
      It will include the file <i>makensisw.exe</i> in the installer and extract it to $INSTDIR.

      <blockquote>
        And also to change the directory of $INSTDIR i think i need to use StrCpy but i am not sure how to use it. Could someone give me an example on how to do this.
      </blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>StrCpy $INSTDIR "C:\YourDir"</code>
</pre>
