To be honest, I was never much of a SB fan (I'm not saying it wasn't a good piece of work, just I prefered a text editor). This is looking like it could be very useful though. Just now I seem to end up with several thousand combo boxes on top of one another and I can't get rid of them, but it is a alphalpha I suppose. The layout, and the way the prog operates (or will eventually operate) is excellant IMHO. Keep up the good work - it's looking like a very useful tool. :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dbareis</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">13th January 2002 04:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Wasn't working too well on WIN2000 but looked promising.

I think that it's more just a general usability issue than anything else. Maybe best to get it working before you spend any time on my pernickity requests :) That said, it would be nice if boxes were dropped into the closest empty space (if one exists).<br><br>I'll say again though, it is a very useful tool.
