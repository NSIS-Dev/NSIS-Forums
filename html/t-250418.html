But I even more like I could resolve problem quickly and I couldn't spend much time on making a better install tool or other tools. It is major function of a special tool. Of course, if we could expand many basing on a professional tool by ourselves, it is better.<br><br>Anyway, I am trying to add something into NSIS to expand its functions.:D</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dandaman32</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2006 18:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">First of all, I'm back guys. I know I haven't shown up around here for awhile but trust me I've been cookin' up some fun stuff :D.<br><br>Anyways, reebes, I've been working on a technology that not only adds web install features to NSIS, but it does so in dramatic fashion using a custom scripting language and 7-zip compression. <b>No kidding.</b> It's called CMPS, which stands for Component Manager Packaging system. It's currently in alpha stage and it isn't very well documented yet, but search the ExperienceUI forums and you'll find some information on how to use the packaging system. You'll want to install both the CM alpha and MkCMP, which will generate a CMP file based on the contents of a directory. I'd also highly recommend that you install 7-zip, <a href="http://www.7-zip.org" target="_blank">www.7-zip.org</a>. It's not required but it can make working with package files a lot easier.<br><br>Download it from <a href="http://xpui.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=193#193" target="_blank">http://xpui.sourceforge.net/forum/vi....php?p=193#193</a>. <b>Read the post first.</b> You may also want to read <a href="http://xpui.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12" target="_blank">this thread</a>.<br><br>Edit: as far as I know, the version of Component Manager that supports CMPS is only compatible with ExperienceUI 1.11pre. You can get the ExperienceUI from <a href="http://xpui.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>-dandaman32</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Comperio</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2006 18:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><b>YES!</b><br><br>That's what I'm talking about!
