      i have a multiple installer and i wanna know at the finish page if a specific program was or was not installed. i must specify that if the app is already there, the installer will pass to the next one. but on the finish page i have to show what was installed and i cannot figure it out how to tell the installer that if the specific program was installed, not to show the label with it's name on the finish page.<br />
      Thank you!</p>
