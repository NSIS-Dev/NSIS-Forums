      <p class="post-content"><strong>A few questions...</strong><br />
      Hey guys I'm prety new to nsis. I was just wondering:<br />
      Is it possible to have a "Select All" and a "Select None" button on ur components page? Or would I have to create a custom page to do so?<br />
      Also with WriteRegStr is it possible for me to write a dword value? If not how do I register a .reg?<br />
      With creating a custom page, how could I put the components there? And would I be able to have a preview image (an image would appear when u hovered over than component, sort of like the description on the components page but with an image)? Thanx heaps.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>No, you'll have to make a Page with installoptions and add the select-all button.<br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Look for the instruction <b>WriteRegDWORD</b><br />

      <blockquote>
        With creating a custom page, how could I put the components there?
      </blockquote>With InstallOptions use the Checkbox and Labels to emulate the components page.<br />

      <blockquote>
        And would I be able to have a preview image (an image would appear when u hovered over than component, sort of like the description on the components page but with an image)?
      </blockquote>I don't know if that's possible in the current versions of Nsis and InstallOptions. I think you'll have to re-write the plugin.<br />
      Hope it helps! :)

      <p class="post-content">Thank you very much for replying.<br />
      <br />
      Turns out I don't need the registry function but it's good to know :D<br />

      <br />
      Oh and one other question, I'm trying to use the get parent function but am failing miserably :(, could someone help me?<br />
      <br />
      Thanx again in advance.

      </blockquote>What get parent function? Directory or Installer Window?

      <p class="post-content">Sorry me again. I've noticed this bug in my installer: when you choose another location for installation it automatically adds the original subdirectory, e.g. if your default location is "C:\Program Files\My Prog" and then you click browse and select "C:\Windows", it'll put "C:\Windows\My Prog".<br />
      <br />
      One other thing: how do u make it so if one section is selected another must be required?<br />
      <br />
      Thanx again.</p>

      </blockquote>Yeah, it's part of the installer system. I don't know how but I think is cool to have this option.<br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>See makensis.nsi example, there's an example of this.
