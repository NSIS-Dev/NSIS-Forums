I can't really believe that the only possibility would be to have the image as a seperate file, because the installer is able to contain everything needed for the setup, but NOT the image?

Why should the logo be placed as a seperate file? If I download a program from the internet, I also just get the setup.exe and no additional files... it's kind of unlogical that the installer can do everything, but not something easy like this...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">CancerFace</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th April 2006 11:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Try <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=1852069#post1852069" target="_blank">this</a> then.<br>CF</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th April 2006 11:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You're right that it should be embedded in the installer.<br>However that wouldn't be a good idea in other respects because it would have to be in an uncompressed format (BMP's are generally quite large), or decompressed directly into memory (which again would require extra installer overhead for this to be accomplished).<br><br>Just extract it to $PLUGINSDIR and let the installer delete it when it's finished.<br><br>-Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Guv'nor</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">24th April 2006 13:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Sorry, I posted into the wrong thread... so I'll post the things I wanted to say again, now into the right thread ;)<br><br>---<br>Thank you!<br><br>I just extracted it into the TEMP-Directory and deleted it afterwards again.
