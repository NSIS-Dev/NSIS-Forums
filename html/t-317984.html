I've been given a script that supports English and Spanish and asked to add Arabic to it.<br><br>I inserted this line<br>!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "Arabic"<br><br>and added Arabic strings to this section<br>LangString FAIL ${LANG_ENGLISH} "FAILED"<br>LangString PRODUCT_NAME ${LANG_SPANISH} "Product Name"<br><br>saved the NSI file as UTF-8, and found out the hard way that NSIS doesn't support Unicode script files.<br><br>This script is using several plugins and I am not NSIS expert. I really really don't want to switch over to Unicode NSIS.<br><br>Is there any way to add arabic strings to the installer script without switching over to Unicode NSIS? Maybe move them to a separate file saved with Arabic codepage?<br><br>thanks,<br>Sergey</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Pidgeot</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th March 2010 04:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You can store them with mixed code pages, but you won't be able to see both Arabic and Spanish at the same time - because their respective code pages simply don't contain all of the required characters (Arabic contains no Spanish accented letters, and the Western European code page doesn't contain any Arabic).<br><br>If you try to display text in the wrong code page, you'll get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake" target="_blank">mojibake</a>. That's probably going to be a problem - because at the very least, you probably need to show both for a language selection dialog.<br><br>I really think you should switch to Unicode NSIS now. You'll get a much better result out of it, and unless you stop updating NSIS entirely, you're going to have to do it eventually anyway, because as far as I can tell, they're actually integrating the Unicode changes now - so it looks like we may have seen the last ANSI release.<br><br>If you're concerned about plugins, then you could post which plugins you are using, and it'd be possible to see where you might experience problems.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
