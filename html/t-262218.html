If it's not installed then it will download NSIS from SourceForge and then install it.<br><br>Then it checks for HM NIS Edit (Detects HM NIS Edit) and then recommends it but if the user doesn't want it installed then it will just proceed. If the user wants it installed then it will download HM NIS Edit from SourceForge and then install it. It will also download/install the Fabio Function plugin which I find to be helpful because you can simply press Ctrl+G and it will pop up a dialog that will allow you to jump to any section or function in the script. Once the HM NIS plugin is installed it will associate HM NIS Edit with NSIS script files (.nsh/.nsi).<br><br>After both of those are installed it will download 2 plugins from the NSIS wiki. They are zip files. Once the plugins are downloaded it will extract the zip files and install the plugins into NSIS.<br><br>The plugins gotten are:<br>ScrollLicense<br>ZipDLL<br><br>Two very helpful plugins for installing. This is a nice script if your friends want to install NSIS. Rather than taking an hour to explain to them how to get it it will do it automatically for them with no hassle.<br><br>keywords:<br>Detect installation<br>Check for installation<br>Detect NSIS<br>Check for NSIS<br>Detect HM NIS Edit<br>Check for HM NIS Edit<br>File association<br><br>Any feedback?<br>SAM:)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Red Wine</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">21st December 2006 17:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Cool!

Post your code only and add links to the related software that you use. Probably under real world installers? See other pages to figure how to deal with wiki. The very first time it seems hard.

After a few rounds would be very easy.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">CraigF</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">22nd December 2006 10:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by sag47</i><br><b>Am I allowed to post it in both?
