      <p class="post-content">Try nsExec::Exec.<br>
      It will run the executable hidden, and the installer will wait until it has finished.<br>
      <br>
      ExecWait also waits for it to finish, but it doesn't hide the command window.<br>
      Exec just executes a program and doesn't wait.<br>

      <p class="post-content">I came to this topic with the same problem -- i.e. how to split the installation into several files. I can understand the solution offered, but I feel it is a little bit underwhelming. If I pack all the files myself with an external packer then:<br>
      <br>
      1. I will run into problem of filesize, because I want the first pack to be smaller, so that it would fit on the CD along with the setup.exe file;<br>
      <br>
      2. I will have to manually set the size of my sections so that the installation displays it properly; and<br>
      <br>
      3. I will have to write some messy interface between my setup and the unpacker (checking for disc in drive, reading the error levels, deleting partially unpacked files if setup is aborted, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      I am a dissatisfied InstallShield user and I am sincerely trying to like NSIS, but if it cannot split the installation into several file "on its own", this seems like a big drawback to me. Or am I missing something?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I am afraid you are not missing anything.<br>
      <br>
      NSIS is developed on a free-time basis where nobody is getting paid (to my knowledge anyway!)<br>
      Therefore, if you want something done, you must do it yourself (and ask questions on the way of course!)<br>
      <br>
      Edit: Perhaps I could make some default NSIS installer header which sets this up, where one must simply identify each CD and file to install. However, like I said it'd be when I have some free time, which is not common at this time!<br>

      <p class="post-content">I appreciate all the effort that went into creating NSIS and I understand the concept of OpenSource project. My point was, that if I use a command line controlled external compressor, then I am using precious little of NSIS functionality.<br>

      </blockquote>How could I identify CD and file to install? As far as I was able to say, NSIS simply creates one file (Setup.exe) and puts everything into it. How could I change this behaviour without changing the source code and recompiling?
