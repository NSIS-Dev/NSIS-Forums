      <p class="post-content">you can probably add the resource using !packhdr and resource hacker. Reading it from the resource is another matter. IE and some other MS things support the res:// protocol, that might help</p>

      <p class="post-content">when i tell "resources" i mean into the installer exe made by makensis. I only want to transfer the file from the memory to the plugin to show it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes i know what you mean, resource hacker can be called from the command line.<br />
      <br />
      But why can't you just extract it like a normal file to $pluginsdir?<br />
      <br />
      Even if it is a resource, people can still make a copy of your image by using resource hacker</p>

      <p class="post-content">so ewasy to understand why i want that.<br />
      Imagine want to use certain images only to show during the install function. Then why we need to extract these images ?<br />
      The best would be to load them on the memory and give this memory to the splash plugin, or others.</p>

      <p class="post-content">$pluginsdir is deleted when installer quits, no reason not to put it there. The image is even compressed, if it was a resource, it would not be compressed</p>

      <p class="post-content">As said use Resource Hacker to add a resource using !packhdr and then use the LoadBitmap API to load it at run time then set it at run time using SendMessage with STM_SETIMAGE.<br />
      <br />
      To be honest though, what on Earth is the point? There really is no benefits by storing the bitmap in the exe header when you can compress it in the data block.<br />

      <p class="post-content">maybe you not understand what i want to do. ok i go to repeat.<br />
      <br />
      I want to use a bmp or gif or jpg. This image is into the installer generated by makensis. But to use this image, i dont want to extract it to a file. I WANT TO USE IT DIRECTLY FORM THE MEMORY. Is that possible with nsis ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, it is possible. Afrow UK just gave you the solution: add a resource using a command line tool like Resource Hacker (using the compile-time !packhdr command) and load it from your executable using the LoadBitmap API (check the System plug-in for info about calling Windows API).<br />
      <br />
      Note that your images will be uncompressed when stored inside the installer resources.</p>
