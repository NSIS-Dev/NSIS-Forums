(L for localizable, I needed something to say its not the original NSIS, but a modification).<br><br>Before all, say I'm sorry for the piece of shit I upload a few days ago. This version is smaller, complete and a relase version. (previous one was a test version I made &amp; fogot to recompile).<br><br>From now version numering will be NSIS_MAYOR.NSIS_MINOR.L-NSIS_VERSION.<br><br>download <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis167.1.zip" target="_blank">here</a> and rename to .exe. (Geocities doesn't allows to upload executables directly).<br><br>Please if you like it, report bugs, suggestions, whatever you think in to improve it (I mean releated to SetText &amp; run-time localization). I'm thinking on a ReadLicenseDataFromFile function, what do you think about ?.<br><br>It's another history but... Today, in my country (Spain), two people (a policeman and a policeman wife) has been killed by Vaske Terrorists (wrongly called "Vaske Independentits" in some countries outside Spain). Let's call things by its name, let's call'em killers.<br><br>New in this version:<br><br>* Partially rewrite code<br>+ Text are processed before be setted (for example if you write $0 as second parameter to SetText it will be extend to the content of $0), Except for FileErrorText &amp; LicenseData, they must be written as you want they to appear in the screen.<br>+ Most Install &amp; uninstalls text are supported (installation types texts &amp; sections text not supported *YET*)<br>+ Included an external program program to let user to choose installation language (it's optional &amp; makes L-NSIS to be a bit slower on init after choosing language, it's due to the script used to load language strings, it must wait to an INI file to be ready).<br>+ L-NSIS packaged made with L-NSIS &amp; localized to Spanish (both english &amp; spanish are supported in the same installation). Uff, now I'm thinking about... if you see 'French' don't choose it, it isn't yet supported (all the messages will appear in english).<br>+ Added loadlang.nsh a script to load all the avaliable texts from an INI file.<br>- No updates in the GUI, this means that if you set a text while it's in the screen it will not be referesh (it will be changed internally but not in the screen). Working on it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">DuaneJeffers</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th November 2001 07:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">What you could have done is create the .exe, then placed it in a .zip file so that when they open it up, it would be a .exe file.<br><br>-Duane</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">FreeNsisTweaker</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th November 2001 11:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Please fix the download link!
