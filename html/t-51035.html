      <p class="post-content">Hi there,<br />
      <br />
      I want to be able to do upgrades gracefully. During the first installation, there are third party drivers I install that I do not want to install on upgrades. Also, files may have been added or removed from the original installation which I would want to synchronize with every upgrade. I have tried to use the existance if the registry key to trigger an uninstall, but for some reason it doesn't execute. I can't think of any other way.<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestion or sample code would be greatly appreciated.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">hi,<br />
      <br />
      well, i would do it like you described it.<br />
      <br />
      1. you could write something to the registry (WriteRegStr) during the first install, so you can check for existance (ReadRegStr) and don't have to install the drivers again.<br />
      <br />
      2. to check for files you could use the 'IfFileExists'<br />
      command.<br />
      <br />
      i don't know why your registry routine didn't work, so maybe you should post some parts of your script.<br />

      <p class="post-content">This is the code I place at the top of the section, before te "File" commands.<br />

      I see the log file showing the execution of the uninstall, but it never actually executes.<br />

      <p class="post-content">hi,<br />
      <br />
      that looks like it should work, but you could debug it a lil' more, so you have more chances to find the failure.<br />
      <br />
      try it like that:<br />
      <br />
      ClearErrors<br />
      ReadRegStr $1 HKLM "SOFTWARE\Cavio Corporation\Cavio" ""<br />
      IfErrors lbl_nouninstall<br />
      <br />
      ReadRegStr $1 HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Cavio" "UninstallString"<br />
      IfErrors lbl_nouninstall<br />
      <br />
      ExecWait "$1" ; &lt;-- maybe you should replace "" with ''<br />
      ; i don't know what happens<br />
      ; when $1 returns this: ""longpathname/filename.exe" /param"<br />
      ; so maybe: '"longpathname/filename.exe" /param' would work<br />
      ; better<br />
      IfErrors lbl_error lbl_nouninstall<br />
      <br />
      lbl_error:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK 'Error: $1' ; only for debuging<br />
      <br />
      lbl_nouninstall:<br />
      <br />
      cu yzo<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks yazno, your assistance helped.<br />
      <br />
      For some reason, I had to issue a "SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"" before the "ExecWait...". Now, the problem I am having is that it is not waiting for the uninstall to complete. As if I were using just "Exec" instead of "ExecWait".<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions? Is anyone trying to do the same thing?<br />
