      <p class="post-content"><strong>Passing name of a batch file as a parameter</strong><br />
      &nbsp; I must call my NSIS setup.exe file from within a batch file and I need to assign to a variable the name of the batch file that called setup.exe<br />
      <br />
      Alternatively I could place the name of the file (or a parameter) after setup.exe (as in the sample batch file below) and somehow I would like to assign that file/parameter to a variable. I tried using the GetParameters sample listed in Functions.htm, but have not been able to figure it out.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">in your batchfile:<br />
      <br />
      setup.exe /Dcaller=%0<br />
      <br />
      and then you should have ${caller} defined as you batchfile name.<br />
      <br />
      untested, but it should work.<br />

      <p class="post-content">/D is only for the compiler, not for the installer.<br />
      <br />
      Can't you do it without this batch file? Maybe the installer can take over the functions of the batchfile. Else, write a small txt file to $TEMP and let the installer read it. Or use the registry...<br />

      <p class="post-content">I agree with Hendri, everything that can be done with a batch can be done with NSIS. If you still want to do it with the batch file you sohuld call setup.exe like this:<br />
      setup.exe %0<br />
      <br />
      And in NSIS:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
Call GetParameters
<br />Pop$1
<br />MessageBox MB_OK$1 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>You will see that $1 now contains the paramters you sent to setup.exe which is the name of the batch file. If $1 does not contain the path to the batch file you can always add $EXEDIR to it.

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the suggestions guys, I will try them soon. I am using NSIS to create a utility to perform certain things. This file needs to be called by third-party software and usually they specify it must be a batch file, that is why I am having the batch file call my NSIS file.<br />
      I want the NSIS file to look for some values in the calling batch file, that is why I need the utility to find out the name of the batch file. I don't want to create a different exe for each product so I want to be able to read the variables from an external file which in this case would be in the batch file itself (If I can read the values from the batch file, I only need to have two files instead of three).<br />
      Now I just need to figure out how to read a batch as if it was an ini file.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi,<br />
      <br />
      Using the unmodified "GetParameters" code in Functions.htm and Kichik's suggestion, I am able to get the name and full path of the calling batch file. Is there a way to just get the name of the calling batch file without it's path?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Modify the code of GetParent to not cut the first part but the last part from the full path. Eg.:</p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Function GetParentMod <br />  Exch $0 ; old $0 is on top of stack<br />  Push $1<br />  Push $2<br />  StrCpy $1 -1<br />  loop:<br />    StrCpy $2 $0 1 $1<br />    StrCmp $2 "" exit<br />    StrCmp $2 "\" exit<br />    IntOp $1 $1 - 1<br />  Goto loop<br />  exit:<br />    IntOp $1 $1 + 1     ;modified<br />    StrCpy $0 $0 "" $1  ;modified<br />    Pop $2<br />    Pop $1<br />    Exch $0 ; put $0 on top of stack, restore $0 to original value<br />FunctionEnd</code>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Hendri, I tried the modified Function GetParentMod and it works great under Win95, but when tested under Win 2000, for some strange reason it adds a <font color="red">"</font> at the end of the calling file name (ie: mybatch.bat").<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't see the reason why this would happen, but you can always check for this and delete the <b>"</b> if necessary:</p>
      <pre>
<code>; Put string<br />StrCpy $0 'C:\My docs\prob.exe"'<br />MessageBox MB_OK $0<br />; Perform check<br />StrCpy $1 $0 "" -1<br />StrCmp $1 '"' 0 Done<br />StrCpy $0 $0 -1<br />Done:<br />MessageBox MB_OK $0</code>

      <p class="post-content">Great! It now works properly under Win 2000. I still need to test it under a variety of systems. Many thanks to Hendri and those who provided suggestions.<br />
