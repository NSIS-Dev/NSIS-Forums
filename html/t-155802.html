      <p class="post-content"><strong>Finding files anywhere?</strong><br />
      I Have a program that uses a Database. However this Database needs to be accessed by a number of different computers and providing a Database Server is out of the question. So we have put the file on a file server. How can we get the location of the Database file so we can make appropriate registry changes as apart of installing the program.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't really understand what you mean. If you want to detect the location of a database, you will at least need to have some information about where you can find it.</p>

      It will be stored within a mapped network drive. I don't know what the drive letter is. So either I would need a function to search all drives or using a second directory page that you select a DB.<br />
      <br />
      Either solution would be good. This is actually for a university project and I am a newbie but can manipulate some one elses code for my needs once I know whats happening</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you know the name of the computer you can use a path like \\computername\drive\dir\file.dat<br />
      <br />
      If you really want to search all drives (then your installation will really take half an hour), you can find file search functions in the archive at <a href="http://nsis.sf.net/archive" target="_blank">http://nsis.sf.net/archive</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">I will only be searching network drives. They should not be that big.<br />
      <br />
      I've used to DetectDrive And FindFiles from the archive to search on network drives. DetectDrive only returns one drive at a time.<br />
      <br />
      I can't seem to find a simple looping mechanism in NSIS which really bugs me.<br />
      <br />
      But I suppose I'll be able to check if there are no more drives and exit the when the file has been found.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I actually re-organised my code so that the search was perfomed within the callback of detect drive</p>
