      <p class="post-content"><strong>Installer for PDA Application</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I have 2 queries and I need directions:<br />
      (1) How do I create an installer using NSIS that installs within the PDA rather than from desktop PC. Any sample code is welcome.<br />
      (2) How do I read/write PDA registry from installer that installs:<br />
      (i) from a desktop PC.<br />
      (ii) within a PDA.<br />
      Any sample codes are welcome.<br />
      <br />
      Please kindly advise. Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here I further elaborate...<br />
      <br />
      (1) I want to create an installer that works in PDA or rather in Pocket PC 2003 environment. This installer can install several CAB files to my PDA.<br />
      So far I have managed to create an installer that installs all my CAB files to the PDA from a desktop PC via ActiveSyn. But I want to create an installer that can install the CAB files to the PDA without the need to use a desktop PC. This would be useful, for example, I can download the installer from some website using Pocket IE to my PDA and execute the installer directly.<br />
      <br />
      (2) I want to read/write PDA registry to implement some kind of expiry for the installer and the PDA application. The installer can write the installation date to the PDA registry. My PDA application can then read the installation date from PDA registry to check for the expiry.<br />
      <br />
      Please kindly advise. Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nsis-installers only support windows 95/98/2000/2003/SE/ME/NT/XP at runtime.<br />
      <br />
      there are possibilities to compile them at linux.<br />
      but i've never heard anything about PDA's.<br />
      <br />
      maybe it'll run on windows CE ...<br />
      surely not on palmOS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want to create installers that will run on the Pocket PC itself, you'd probably have to compile a special exehead for the Pocket PC. I wish I had more information or even the ability to test this on my own, but I've never even seen a PDA with Pocket PC ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK. So I can only create an installer that install the CAB files to PDA from desktop. If that is the case, is there any way to write to the PDA registry from the desktop installer?<br />
      <br />
      Please kindly advise. Thank you.</p>
