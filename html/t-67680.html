Update</strong><br>Ok, this is something bad.<br><br>1) Laptop, after thanksgiving weekend, stoped running. The Hard Drive could not be found and I had lost the entire NSIS Project House site.<br><br>2) I will be going in for surgery next week and I cannot get the site started again.<br><br>So, I am asking you, if you can, could you help me create the site. The requirements are as follows: You need to know how to code PHP-based pages, use and create MySQL tables and produce an great site in little time. I hope to have the site up by New Years, and I will be working on some of the coding.

I have decided to not take an advisory role in the Website for NSIS Project House. I am still going to be the project admin, but I will just be looking in and helping with problems and I will be writing documents for the help on NSIS. This news has not been told to anyone and in fact, this will be the first time anyone will know this. This news comes with the new Admin to the project, our own Koen van de Sande. He has and will continue to work on the website. He has been given Webmaster Admin status with some restrictions. Hopefully he will take the project website and make it much better than what I can give you guys. On a plus side, Koen has made an barebones website that will continue to grow.
