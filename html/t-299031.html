It's late here, and I'm pretty tired. I don't have a lot of time to do this, so I thought I'd better put up my question as sson as possible. Again, I'm sorry if this has already been answered.<br><br>I am making an extremely simple CD-based installer. I want my files to remain separate from my installer, as installation is more a convenience than a necessity.<br><br>Specifically, I want to do the following:<br>[list=1][*]Open a dialog box that gives the user the ability to either continue with the install, or cancel the process.[*]Copy all files (including folders) from the CD to a directory on the HD.[*]Create a special folder made of specially crafted shortcuts on the desktop.*[/list=1]<br><br>So is this possible (and fairly simple coding) for this language, or do I need to look for a more all-purpose solution?<br><br><br><font size="1">* In case you wanted to know, I have to run the installed programs through DOSBox. I am making a CD of a friend's DOS programs so they can easily be installed on Windows, as he knows next to nothing about computers. (He didn't even know the programs were DOS programs...)</font></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Comperio</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">23rd October 2008 15:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">All should be pretty much "out of the box"<br><br>1. Use a message box in the .onInit function<br>2. Use CopyFiles<br>3. use CreateShortcut (with maybe CreateDirectory)<br><br>Even the most basic install should do what you want. The best way to learn is just jump in an start playing! :D<br><br>(Have a look at some of the samples with NSIS and the help files to get you started.)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
