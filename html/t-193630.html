<code><br>Function .onInit<br>        ReadRegStr $0 HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "01"<br>        ${if} $0 == 1<br>                !insertmacro UnselectSection ${Sec01}<br>                SectionSetText ${Sec01} ""<br>        ${endif}<br><br>        ReadRegStr $0 HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "02"<br>        ${if} $0 == 1<br>                !insertmacro UnselectSection ${Sec02}<br>                SectionSetText ${Sec02} ""<br>        ${endif}<br><br>        ReadRegStr $0 HKCU "Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections" "03"<br>        ${if} $0 == 1<br>                !insertmacro UnselectSection ${Sec03}<br>                SectionSetText ${Sec03} ""<br>        ${endif}<br><br>StrCpy $1 ${Sec04}<br><br>FunctionEnd</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      The <b>StrCpy $1 ${Sec04}</b> is for the one section function, the rest is for the other.<br>
      <br>
      I've noticed that it doesn't matter if I have the <b>StrCpy $1 ${Sec04}</b> in there or not.<br>
      <br>
      What happens when the installer is run, is that when the components page is loaded the first time, the default component is checked.<br>
      Then, if I check the optional component, they are <i>both</i> checked, which I don't want to happen.<br>
      <br>
      This seems to be because the <b>StrCpy $1 ${Sec04}</b> isn't used at all.<br>
      <br>
      After the initial checking of the optional component(after they are both checked), the "one section" function seems to work; when you then uncheck one, the other is checked and vice versa - but then it's a little too late, since I doubt users are going to check it more than once before they hit 'Next'.<br>
      <br>
      So what if I later have an even bigger script and need a lot of different functions to happen within .onInit - how do I do it?<br>
      <br>
      As I said I have made a custom function already, and if I try to make a similar one, it says it's already defined at compile time.<br>
      <br>
      [EDIT]-It seems that OneSection doesn't work like I want it to - that's the problem.<br>
      <br>
      I just removed the other code and only left <b>StrCpy $1 ${Sec04}</b> inside .onInit, and I get the same problem as before; on first load of the components page, both of those componens can be checked. I can't have that happening. Any other way?<br>
      <br>
      I have tried to !include setsections.nsh that someone suggested in another thread, but even though I rename the SEC4 etc. to the section names in my script, and put the function in the same place as I now do(below all my sections), I still get "Sec04 not defined" when compiling, which I don't get using OneSection.[/EDIT]<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for any help.
