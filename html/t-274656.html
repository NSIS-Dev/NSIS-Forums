The only things I can remember changing on in my script since the last time I successfully ran it, were the file directory of my program, the version number, and the defualt installation directory. The ShowInstDetails is still there and still says "Show." If anybody knows what could be going on, please let me know.<br><br>Thanks!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th July 2007 14:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Perhaps you have a duplicated ShowInstDetails or maybe a SetDetailsView in a section.<br><br>Stu</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">madams</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">20th July 2007 15:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Nope, I just searched through my entire script, but could only find ShowInstDetails ounce, and could not find SetDetailsView at all.
