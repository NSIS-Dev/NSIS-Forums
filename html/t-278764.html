      <p class="post-content"><strong>Create a shortcut link which has "Run as administrator" option enabled on Vista</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      During an installation process I need to create a link in the start menu and in case we are on Windows Vista I need this link to have "Run as administrator" option checked.<br />
      <br />
      The link is to Windows component (rundll.exe), so I can't achieve this by adding a manifest to an exe.<br />
      <br />
      Is this possible with NSIS?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Createshortcut does not support this. You could create a small wrapper program with a manifest that exec's rundll32 (you could create the app in nsis even)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I use rundll.exe to execute the function in my dll. So theoretically I could provide a standalone exe for that. However I put that inside a dll long time ago (before Vista) because I wanted to make things simpler.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway I noticed that on Windows Vista it's the 21st byte of the .lnk file that marks whether the shortcut is launched with elevated rights or not. I could simply modify that byte after .lnk is created (in case we are installing on Vista), but that would be an ugly hack.</p>

      It was beyond me to write it in NSIS script so I put it into the dll, and called via rundll32 upon sucessful install.

      <p class="post-content">OK, I am not sure if there is something is wrong with this method, but I came across this and have not seen a reference to it anywhere on NSIS forum. I think it is way easier than anything else proposed here and seems to work great.<br />
      <br />
      Basically the "Run As Administrator" is simply a registry value stored in "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\layers" , so you can use:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br /> WriteRegStr HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\layers" \<br />"$MY_SHORCUT_OR_EXE" "RUNASADMIN"<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Obviously replace $MY_SHORCUT_OR_EXE with your executable or shortcut. You can replace HKLM with HKCU for user specific setting instead of all users.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I figured I'd share.<br />

      </blockquote>None taken. I am curious myself how come this never came up here. I am no expert on Vista, (having ran it for the first time yesterday)I am updating my "roll-your-own" OpenVPN package to support Vista and ran into this need. It works for me, auto-prompting to up privileges every time I run whatever I put into the reg. The only issue I still have is the running apps with "run-as-admin" automatically at login. For some reason instead of prompting the user, it just blocks it forcing the user to run it manually :-(<br />

      How would this effect the shortcuts/exe's functionality in xp?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      you mention $MY_SHORCUT_OR_EXE .. does this mean if you have an exe in programfiles and a shortcut to that on the desktop and start menu you only have to do it once for the exe and all shortcuts to that would be fixed or do i have to do it once for all shortcuts and for the exe .. exact details are crucial to not having to fart arse around guessing how it works<br />
      <br />
      when you refer to<br />
      <br />
      qoute:<br />
      <br />
      "The only issue I still have is the running apps with "run-as-admin" automatically at login."<br />
      <br />
      Are you refering to apps launched via a shortcut added to $SMSTARTUP ?? when windows bootsup?<br />
      <br />
      This is looking promising so far..<br />

      </blockquote>I experimented with this and it seems like if exe is set to run as admin, shortcuts automatically inherit it. I started off working on shortcuts, but it seems like doing exe is enough<br />

      <br />
      Which under XP start openvpn-gui when user logs in. Under Vista after reboot I get a message in system tray - "Windows has blocked some startup programs". I tried putting the shortcut in the startup folder - same thing. Looks like you cannot run "run as admin" programs automatically on login - which sucks.<br />

      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I am still relatively new to NSIS, so I am not sure I understand how to use plugins.<br />
      <br />
      I downloaded the ShellLink Plug In from: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellLink_plug-in" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellLink_plug-in</a><br />
      <br />
      I unzipped it and copied the ShellLink.dll file to Program Files\NSIS\Plugins.<br />
      <br />
      Trying to follow the example on the plugin page, I then modified a part of my script from:<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      CreateDirectory "$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}"<br />
      CreateShortCut "$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk" "$INSTDIR\${PRODUCT_NAME}.exe"<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      to<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      CreateDirectory "$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}"<br />
      CreateShortCut "$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk" "$INSTDIR\${PRODUCT_NAME}.exe"<br />
      <br />
      ShellLink::SetRunAsAdministrator "$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk"<br />
      Pop $0<br />
      <br />
      $0=0 -no errors<br />
      $0=-1 -error<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      That causes the following error when I try to compile my script:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Plugin Command: SetRunAsAdministrator $STARTMENU\Programs\Sharp Software\Auto Sales Manager WPF Server.lnk<br />
      Pop: $0<br />
      Invalid command: $0=0<br />

      </blockquote>Normally I'd say 'add a manifest', but I have no idea if that works for file associations. I think you can put "runas.exe /user:Administrator yourexe.exe %1" (or something similar) as the opening application, and it will throw a window asking for the admin password. But it's probably much better to make your exe take care of this problem itself: make it so it launches another instance of itself as admin, if it's being run as user.
