      <p class="post-content"><strong>Chinese Character Wanted!</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      When I run your example languages, Simplified Chinese version comes up with squiggles everywhere, and not Chinese Characters. How do I get Chinese charaters to appear ?<br />
      <br />
      eg, I want characters like these:<br />
      å¸³å‹™ä¸_å¿ƒï¼šè´æ³¨æå– æ_¥é©Ÿ äºŒ ä¹‹ äºŒ (it says Cashier: 2 of 2.)<br />
      <br />
      Your Language file need to utf-8 , utf-16, unicode, or some other multi-byte characters.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a tutorial or something I can read to get Chinese language working ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">One other thing, Does the installer support being called something like:<br />
      "æ¨‚åŠ›è³ŸåŸŽä¸Ÿæ–‡ç‰ˆå®‰è£è»Ÿé«”.exe"? ( in English is "HypeGamingSetup.exe")<br />
      I tried changing the name of "languages.exe" to that, and got a "Error Lanching Installer" Error. I changed the Languages.exe to "abc.exe" and it worked, so that indicates to me that inside your code your function "GetModuleFileName()" is returning only 8-bit characters for the name of the setup?</p>

      <p class="post-content">the system you run the installer on might need simplified chinese support installed. Like, even though they display fine in a browser for me I might not be able to run an aplication with those characters in them. Just a thought.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've gone to regional language setting and install the Asian Languages pack, which should enable simple Chinese. Also, the Chinese version of our program display Chinese charaters fine, but we use 16-bit (Wide character) encoded character strings.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What were your Chinese tests done on? I haven't tested it on the chinese version of Windows xp, (only an English version that has the language packs installed) which is the only thing I can think of that *might* make your installers work.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, you really should goto utf-8, utf-16, unicode encoding for all your text files, instead of leaving them as 8-bit ascii. Also, internally you should use Wide character strings, otherwise you'll run into more and more issues with language conversion. It's a difficult hurdle to jump, but one we've made recently for our own program.<br />
      <br />
      Only when you make that change can you say that your program "fully supports other languages".</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS does not support Unicode. You must set the language for non-Unicode applications in the advanced tab of the Regional and Language Options control panel to the language you want to view. You can also try using <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nolybab" target="_blank">Nolybab</a>.</p>
