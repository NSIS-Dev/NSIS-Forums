      <p class="post-content"><strong>Compress file on uninstall</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      i ve been searching posts about compressing files in NSIS installer/uninstaller but was not able to find information about my query.<br />
      I'd like to compress some files on uninstalling process before they get deleted by my uninstaller. I wanted to know if they were a NSIS plug-in that can help me. I found ZIPDLL.DLL plug-in but it seems it can only be used to uncompress files.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.</p>

      Well, you want to compress files before they get deleted by your uninstaller...<br />
      You probably could do that by the stand alone command line 7zip utility (7za.exe) that is available on 7zip download section.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks i ll give a try to 7za.exe<br />
      Therefore, i think i gave a bad explanation to my problem :<br />
      <br />
      I made a NSIS script to install my application. With that application user can create projects that are saved into a directory 'Projects' in $INSTDIR. When the user decide to uninstall my application i display a custom page (InstallOptions with checkboxes) that ask user if he want to keep files in the 'Projects' directory. I used to use RMDIR /r $INSTDIR to uninstall my application, i don't know how to skip deletion of a particular directory so i decided to copy this directory to a temporary place and wanted them to be zipped. I thought i could use NSIS script / plug-in to compress this files/sub-directories to store them in case of re-installation of my application.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe this can be done with 7za.exe embedded in the NSIS script installer.<br />
      <br />
      Thx</p>

      </blockquote>There's a good chance to achieve that with Advanced Uninstall Log,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I first wanted to use uninstall log (i don't remember if it was yours) but my app is 256Mb, 5617 files and 1897 directories, i was afraid that the log file would be too large to be used correctly at uninstall...</p>
