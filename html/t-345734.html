      <p class="post-content"><strong>extracting zip in unicode installer</strong><br />
      Question is pretty simple. Is there any zip extracting pug-in which works in Unicode? As i could make sure ZIPDLL, nsUnZip and even 7zip don't work with Unicode?<br />
      <br />
      Is it true NSIS is not used in Unicode? I hope someone has encountered this problem and solved it.</p>

      I found nothing about working with zip packages in Unicode on the whole forum. Even this tread was left with no answer.<br />
      <br />
      I had no other choice but to rewrite sources. For those who need to use macro<br />
      <b>!insertmacro ZIPDLL_EXTRACT SOURCE DESTINATION FILE</b><br />
      <br />
      Now it works in Unicode, just copy it to the plugins directory. I did nothing with other functions so probably in Unicode they still don't work. Actually I'm not sure if even this attachment is needed since after so many years nobody carried about this. Anyway, here it is.</p>

      </blockquote>Yes, probably you are right, and I had confused it with the ZipArchive which is part of ZipDLL

      Old friend,<br />
      You'll be happy to know that you've helped at least one poor soul.<br />
      I've had the same problem with using zipDLL with unicode nsis, and your revised dll works perfect !!<br />
      Thank you<br />
