The Ones calling a delete on certain rows of a table always return an error,the ones calling to drop base do not drop because they say that de DB is in use. Here is the big picture, i call a script to create a temporary DB to retrieve the Data of two existing DB then modify the temporary DB(delete some rows on two tables).After, i drop the two existing DB, recreate them, transfer data in those two DB from the temporary one, drop the temporary one.The data transfering goes well both ways,the big issue is i cannot delete rows from the temporary DB and i cannot drop the two existing DB. I had to seperate alot of queries (like the ones using Identity_Insert on /off) to make them work .<br>1) Is there some kind of protection that prevents Data from being deleted when called from Nsis?<br><br>2)Why Nsis says the DB is in use when i put a 10 second sleep before the last insert to drop a DB?<br><br><br>P.S. Remember i doubled check all My queries and they are working perfectly fine when i call them from MS SQL or Access.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jpderuiter</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th September 2010 23:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Can you give some sample code you are using?<br>It should work without a problem.<br><br>What version of MSSQL are you running against?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Grennvicted</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">12th September 2010 00:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">In NSIS<br><br></p><pre>

      The Deletion query that works in MS SQL<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>Delete From MyTable<br>Where (Id&gt;1 Or Id =1) And (Id&gt;5 or Id=5) And (otherStuffId=5 And OtherStuffId=6)<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      The Id is a primary key and i want to delete the 2 rows of each Id where otherStuffId=5 and otherStuffId=6<br>
      <br>
      The deletion query return an error message (with NSIS) that's what i do not understand.<br>
      I'm workin with Ms SQL express 2005.

      <p class="post-content">First I think nothing will deleted ever with this query, because (otherStuffId=5 And OtherStuffId=6) will always return false...<br>
      <br>
      But about your error, what error code is returned?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You were right about the query but in acces and MSSQL both returned Success.(An "Or" was needed). Plus the fact i'm new to NSIS i used an old Script using execute "sb_attach_db".<br>
      It looks like you need to (RMDir ${Installdir}/"SQL") recursivly remove the SQL folder when using the command, but not when you execute a script instead of a query.So that was why the series of scripts were working partly and part time.<br>
      <br>
      Thx!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello,<br>
      not sure of what are you meaning with 'So that was why the series of scripts were working partly and part time.'<br>
      If you have scripts to ececute you should extract them in a convenient folder and then execute them.<br>
      Usually you can extract them in the $PLUGINSDIR folder. This is a temp folder that nsis removes after installation.<br>
      Look at the example provided with the plugin.<br>
