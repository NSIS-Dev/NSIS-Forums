It is similar to the mIRC shareware model. It encourages registration within 30 days but is still functional if not registered.<br><br>I am planning on making an install of Venis with NSIS packaged in the install. The package will include a readme.txt and credits.txt. The credits.txt will list names found in the Credits html page of the NSIS Html docs. The Html docs will remain untouched along with the location NSIS installs by default with all added packages in the current NSIS distributions.<br><br>I personally do not think any one NSIS editor should be packaged into the NSIS install. I think if anything, it should be packaged by the Editor. If you do package an NSIS editor with NSIS, it should be a new opensource project. It may be an advantage in keeping them seperate; you can install NSIS and then install the different editors and be confident they will not mess up the currently installed NSIS.<br><br>It would be nice to have a section in the documentation with all the popular NSIS editors with a brief description what their strengths are. For instance, I made Venis into an editor rather than a wizard script generator because that is what I wanted.<br><br>I will, hopefully by tomorrow, have a prerelease ready of Venis 2.1. I will send an E-mail to the Source Forge NSIS administrators and post a link to it here.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">n0On3</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">11th July 2003 04:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by sealite</i><br><b>I don't know who voted for new project but guys keep in mind that for new project we'll have results in weeks, months ?!</b></blockquote>What I understood with that options it that the editor should be a separated (new) project, not an enterly new project.

Many people want to use development snapshot or other versions.
