      <p class="post-content"><strong>"pareFileTime" error on install?</strong><br />
      I have a user with Windows XP who is unable to install one of our products which uses NSIS (The product is Bugdom 2). When he runs the installer he gets the error:<br />
      <br />
      The procedure entry point areFileTime could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll.<br />
      <br />
      I've searched this forum and FAQ and SF forums for any mention of this error and come up empty.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone got a clue on what the cause could be?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would say the installer is corrupted. He should download it again.<br />
      <br />
      He was unlucky that the corruption seems to have occured in such a way that Windows could not load it properly. Otherwise the installer's built-in CRC check would have given a sensible message.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is happening with dozens of customers on all of our titles that use NSIS.<br />
      <br />
      So, if it's because of bad downloads, then NSIS needs some work on the integrity check routines.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Looking thru the sources, it would appear that this should be "CompareFileTime", as that is the only occurance of "pareFileTime" I could find.<br />
      <br />
      Still looking at ideas; a 90% failure rate on downloads is very discouraging.<br />
      <br />
      Bugdom 2 and Otto Matic are the programs on our site currently using NSIS. Full versions are in the FTP directory with the demos.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you think it's an NSIS issue, please attach a script that reproduces it.<br />
      <br />
      NSIS contains a full data check, however, if the installer is corrupted in such a way that Windows can't load it anymore, there is nothing that can be displayed.</p>

      </blockquote>My script is attached, although I am not sure how it will help.<br />
      <br />
      I see what you mean about the data check; it does seem that the symbol table is being corrupted and preventing the installer from launching.<br />
      <br />
      Would have thought by now that MS would get their act together on file downloads with IE... sigh.<br />

      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">I downloaded bug2demo_install.exe from ftp using a download manager (FlashGet) and I got the same error. I expect the file on the server itself is corrupted.</p>
