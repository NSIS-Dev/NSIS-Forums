      <p class="post-content">Ok, my mistake Joost. It is working. I was getting confused because it was taking longer for the file to actually appear within Windows explorer. So with that in mind here is the first version,<br>
      <br>
      The program is called FolderList and used within a script as follows,<br></p>
      <pre>
!system "FolderList.exe $\"c:\Temp\*.*$\" $\"*.exe,*.ico$\""
<br>&gt;!include "FolderList.exe.txt" 
</pre>Note the quotation marks on the call to "!system" I think this is what messed me up the first few time.<br>
      <br>
      You currently cannot recurse a file structure like you can with the NSIS "File /r" command. I will be adding this soon. Breakdown of the paramters are as follows,<br>
      <br>
      1st paramter - The file/folder of files to include. Wildcards are<br>
      allowed.<br>
      2nd paramter - List of files to exclude from the inclusion list.<br>
      Wildcards are allowed.

      <p class="post-content">Here's an updated version of FolderList. You can now use /r to recurse a folder structure. I have also created two macros which can be used insted of the !system and !include commands.<br></p>
      <pre>
!macro FOLDER_LIST INCLUDE_DIR EXCLUDE_FILES
<br> !system "FolderList.exe $\"${INCLUDE_DIR}$\" $\"${EXCLUDE_FILES}$\""
<br> !include "FolderList.exe.txt"
<br>&gt;!macroend
<br><br>&gt;!macro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE INCLUDE_DIR EXCLUDE_FILES
<br> !system "FolderList.exe /r $\"${INCLUDE_DIR} $\" $\"${EXCLUDE_FILES}$\""
<br> !include "FolderList.exe.txt"
<br>&gt;!macroend 
<br>&gt;

</pre>Some example usages are,<br>
      <pre>
<code>
"c:\Temp\*.*" "*.exe,*.com"
<br>&gt;!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE "c:\Temp\*.*" "folder1\*.txt,folder2\*.com" 
</code>
</pre>The first example I have explained in previous posts. The second example will include all files in c:\Temp and it's subfolders. It will cut out txt files in c:\Temp\folder1 and com files from c:\Temp\folder2<br>
      <br>
      FolderList can be used in replace of any "File" script command.<br>
      <br>
      A note on how files/folders are ignored. If you choose to recurse a file structure the ignore file list must mirror this structure.<br>
      <br>
      If for example Temp has sub directories of folder1, folder2, etc. and I want to ignore all exe files in both folder1 and folder2 I have to do the following,<br>
      <br>
      FolderList.exe /r "c:\Temp\*.*" "folder1\*.exe,folder2\*.exe"<br>
      <br>
      You cannot ignore all exe files in folder1 and folder2 using one command. You currently have to specify them as separate ignore filters.<br>
      <br>
      I am working on a way to get around this now. Vytautas (or anyone else), if you've got any suggestions I could definitely use them now.

      </blockquote>This program makes the the files/folders that you specify invisible to the compiler. Just take a look at the text file it creates. It's just a bunch of "File" commands. You can include the lines I specified anywhere the "File" command is valid because it's doing the same thing.<br>
      <br>
      I know the CVS dir's your talking about as I've run into the same problem. If you have alot of files/folders to include it will be tedious to ignore each "CVS" named folder within all the folders you are including. This is why I'm working on a way to ignore a file or folder that exists in multiple folders. I mentioned this in a previous post.<br>
      <br>
      To ignore a CVS folder just use<br>
      <pre>
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE "c:\\YourFolder\\*.*" "CVS\\*.*" 
</pre>This will ignore the folder c:\YourFolder\CVS and all files/folders within it.

      </blockquote>This is true. The $OUTDIR variable is not modified although this would be the case as well if you were to use the "File" command. It doesn't modify the $OUTDIR variable. My program works the same way. You need to set $OUTDIR before you call my program. I probably should've mentioned that initally, sorry about that.<br>

      <pre>
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE "c:\\Temp\\folder1\\*.txt" 
</pre>Obviously this doesn't include any of the other folders under Temp but it does work. Provided you don't have a large number of folders in the Temp folder that may work for you. Just add the other folders separately. Obviously if it worked the way you're suggesting then all of the other subfolders under "Temp" would work. So there is a benfit to it. I'll put it on my list of features to add.<br>

      <p class="post-content">The first error only seems to happen when you compile in Win2k as when I tested with Win98 it worked fine but when I tried to compile the same script in Win2k I got an error that said that the file was not found listing the name of the subdirectory.<br>
      <br>
      The second problem is that if you use a single file command to recurse a directory tree it also recreates the whole tree so that the files in the subfolders on the local machine are placed in the same subdirectories on the target machine. However you program produces a list of file commands that copy files from their subdirectories into the $OUTDIR set by the installer before the call but it does not recreate the directory tree. For example: If you have two directories one containing exe files and another containing help files using your program both the exe and help files would end up in the root directory rather that the 'bin' and 'help' directories.<br>
      <br>
      As for the last suggestion I was thinking of a case where the whole program directory could be recursed but one of several directories only needed to copy one type of file. It would make this sort of senario a lot easier to manage.<br>

      where ${NSISDIR}\ is of course the directory I administer my project in. The following error occurs at MakeNSISW:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code>!insertmacro: FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE<br>!system: "FolderList.exe /r "C:\Programme\NSIS\TSW\*.* " "CVS\*.*""<br>!system: returned 0<br>!include: "FolderList.exe.txt"<br>File: "C:\Programme\NSIS\TSW\DATENBANK" -&gt; no files found.<br>Usage: File [/nonfatal] [/a] ([/r] filespec [...]|/oname=outfile one_file_only)<br>!include: error in script: "FolderList.exe.txt" on line 1<br>Error in macro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE on macroline 2</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Any idea?

        The second problem is that if you use a single file command to recurse a directory tree it also recreates the whole tree so that the files in the subfolders on the local machine are placed in the same subdirectories on the target machine. However you program produces a list of file commands that copy files from their subdirectories into the $OUTDIR set by the installer before the call but it does not recreate the directory tree. For example: If you have two directories one containing exe files and another containing help files using your program both the exe and help files would end up in the root directory rather that the 'bin' and 'help' directories.
      </blockquote>I see what your saying now. Yes you're right I didn't take this into account originally. I recently fixed this problem and will probably post a new version tomorrow.

      <p class="post-content">Ok this version should solve the directory recreation issue in the installing folder. Given a folder "c:\temp" that has many subfolders say, folder1, folder2, folder3, ..., folderN these folders will be created in the installtion directory as $OUTDIR\folder1, $OUTDIR\folder2 rather than dumping everything into $OUTDIR as it was doing before.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Dear rsegal -<br>
      <br>
      I gave your latest FolderList a try, but still without success. Ok perhaps I am doing it wrong, so here is what I did:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>!macro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE INCLUDE_DIR EXCLUDE_FILES<br>  !system "FolderList.exe /r $\"${INCLUDE_DIR} $\" $\"${EXCLUDE_FILES}$\""<br>  !include "FolderList.exe.txt"<br>!macroend<br><br>!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE "${NSISDIR}\TSW\*.*" "CVS\*.*"</code>
</pre><br>
      (Still the part I've mentioned above)<br>
      <br>
      This time, I get another compilererror:<br>
      <pre>
<code>!insertmacro: FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE<br>!system: "FolderList.exe /r "C:\Programme\NSIS\TSW\*.* " "CVS\*.*""<br>!system: returned 0<br>!include: "FolderList.exe.txt"<br>Push: $OUTDIR<br>Error: Can't add entry, no section or function is open!<br>!include: error in script: "FolderList.exe.txt" on line 1<br>Error in macro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE on macroline 2</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      If I take a closer look to the generated file FolderList.exe.txt (Line 1-11 which are mentioned to be the faulty line), it is showing the following lines:<br>
      <pre>
<code>Push $OUTDIR<br>CreateDirectory "$OUTDIR\DB"<br>SetOutPath "$OUTDIR\DB"<br>Pop $OUTDIR<br>Push $OUTDIR<br>CreateDirectory "$OUTDIR\DB\CVS"<br>SetOutPath "$OUTDIR\DATENBANK\CVS"<br>File "C:\Path\to\NSIS\TSW\DB\CVS\Entries"<br>File "C:\Path\to\NSIS\TSW\DB\CVS\Entries.Extra"<br>File "C:\Path\to\NSIS\TSW\DB\CVS\Repository"<br>File "C:\Path\to\NSIS\TSW\DB\CVS\Root"</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Any ideas?<br>

      <p class="post-content">A new bug in the latest version of your program. It is a little difficult to describe so I will attach directory tree snapshots the dir.txt file contains the source directory and dir1.txt contains the target directory produced by the installer. {NOTE: No files were actually excluded in this script.}<br>
      <br>
      Because the files in your program are sorted in alphabetical order files in the root directories get placed in subdirectories is they come after a folder in the sorting order.<br>

      </blockquote>Sure you could probably do the same thing with those script calls. I'm doing it with the same Win32 calls in C++. NSIS is definitely nice but I've been using C/C++ alot longer than I've been working with NSIS. It's what I'm most proficient and comfortable with. That's why I chose it.
