The source code is available, so you can just look it through yourself and get certain that it is not. If antivirus software detects NSIS to be a trojan, then it may be the vendors of the shipped software, that has a trojan and has used NSIS as an installer. That has nothing to do with NSIS.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sheik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th August 2008 16:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Wow, you are actually PURPOSELY installing the Alexa Toolbar???<br><br>You do know that its considered Spyware, right?<br><br>Instead of installing it, you should be RUNNING from it!<br><br>But I have no doubt, that you will get warnings from your AntiVirus/Spyware Monitors, as basically anything from Alexa will trigger them, as they (Alexa) are generally considered bad news.<br><br>Heck, if anything, The NSIS project should be mad that these guys are USING NSIS to wrap up their Spyware...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">QOAL</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th August 2008 17:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">"DR/<b>alexbar</b>.N.142 dropper"<br>Doesn't that say it all, it's not saying the installer is a virus at all.<br>It's telling you that alexa is.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Lassar</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">29th August 2008 19:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Anyway, I have not installed the ie alexabar.<br><br>I deleted it.<br><br>It is Spyware.<br><br>The reason I am going to use it is to improve my google ratings.<br><br>What do you think of making a special profile in FireFox just for it.<br><br>In this case I would run the FireFox Alexa Toolbar profile and pop in to my website once a month.<br><br>Quit, then go to my regular profile.<br><br>Do you think I would be safe if I did this ?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Sheik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">30th August 2008 03:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I don't know much about Alexa, except that it is a Virus/Spyware, but you are kind of playing cards with the devil here...<br><br>How do you know that Alexa will play "nicely" like you want it to?<br><br>By its very nature, it is not MEANT to play nice, but instead, hijack your computer for its own purposes...<br><br>If I were you, I would try to find a different program, that isn't a Virus/Spyware, to use for your stuff...</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
