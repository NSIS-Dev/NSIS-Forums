But the compiler states that there is a mismatch. They both are XP icons, meaning they range from 16x16 to 48x48 at the usual colors (16, 256..)<br><br>So what does the docs mean when it states that:<br></p><blockquote>Note that if you use different icons for installer and uninstaller the file size and structure of the icons has to match otherwise the build of your installer will fail.</blockquote>1. Filesize?? How can the filesize be equal to each other when there are different amounts of colors?<br><br>2. Structur, meaning there has to be the same 'types' of icons?<br><br>I need some understanding and coding help here, hope you guys can.

Doesn't mention actual contents of the icon re what colour goes in what square.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">tatsudoshi</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th November 2004 18:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Well if the point of view is that the user of the docs already knows what the docs are talking about, then yes. But for the N'th % of the public that does not know how icons are made up, the docs does not give enough help. It would take 3-4 more lines to tell what is meant by 'structure' so again, it is a matter of what point of view we are talking about.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th November 2004 21:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">How about:</p><blockquote>Sets the icon of the installer. Every icon in the icon file will be included in the installer. Note that if you use an uninstaller, each icon in the icon file must have the same size and color depth as its matching icon in the uninstaller icon file. The order of the icons in the icon file also matters. For example, if the installer icon file has three icons, first icon sized 32x32 pixels with 8bpp, second icon sized 16x16 pixels with 8bpp and third icon sized 8x8 with 8bpp; then the uninstaller icon file must have three icons with the same sizes and color depths, in the same order.</blockquote>?</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">tatsudoshi</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th November 2004 10:13 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yes, I think that would help alot more :)<br>:up:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">tatsudoshi</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th November 2004 10:13 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yes, I think that would help alot more :)<br>:up:</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script src="../js/highlight.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
