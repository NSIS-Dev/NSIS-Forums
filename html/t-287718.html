<code><br>AccessControl::GrantOnFile "$DataDir" "(BU)" "GenericRead + GenericWrite + DeleteChild"<br><br></code>
</pre><br>
      This doesn't seem to be working ... have I got the syntax right? As it's more-or-less as copied from the page on the Wiki, I hope so! In particular, am I literally supposed to put "(BU)" as trustee for all built-in users or is that just a shorthand for "BUILTIN\USERS" in the example on the Wiki-page?<br>
      <br>
      I'm using the current version of AccessControl (downloaded yesterday) and I see from the Wiki that in recent versions "Error messages are now just returned on NSIS stack" ... so presumably every call to GrantOnFile must be followed by a pop instruction to get the error status -- what form is that status in? Is it a Win32 numeric error code, or what?<br>
      <br>
      It would be really nice to have some working example code (with error handling) on that Wiki page.

      </blockquote>Hmm... Unless I'm mistaken that is the SID for the "Users" group, and not all users of a PC are members of that group (Administrators, for example, are not ... though they'll have the right rights anyway). Is that what "(BU)" is meant to mean? I really want to allow access to all/any users ...<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps I should use "Everyone" (S-1-1-0)?<br>
      <br>
      Incidentally, it seems that Windows does recognize 2-character abbreviations for well-known SIDs in some situations, so "(BU)" may well work as well as "(S-1-5-32-545)" (and maybe "(S-1-1-0)" can be written "(WD)") ... I had a look at the code for the AccessControl plugin and it strips the parentheses off the 'Trustee' string and passes it to ConvertStringSidToSid which is documented as accepting the 2-letter codes.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for your help.

      </blockquote>Just for the record: ConvertStringSidToSid only accepts abbreviations for standard SIDs in XP and later. If you have to support Win2k you will have to use the numeric SIDs.
