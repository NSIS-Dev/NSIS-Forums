      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS InstallBuilder in the works</strong><br />
      As a new fan of NSIS I only had one thing that I didn't like about - no GUI interface. Yes there are some 3rd party editors that provide some good start wizards - but I like my gui and I had my fill of editing script files after running BBS's for years.<br />
      <br />
      So I decided to see if I could actually come up with a complete GUI front end for NSIS - something that would let new comers to NSIS; and old hands, create an install pack without having to see a line of script.<br />
      <br />
      so was born NSIS InstallBuilder - now it is still in the early stages but I thought I would post a link to some screen shots of the work in progress incase anyone else might be interested.<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      If anyone is interested in having a closer look at the early builds and reporting back any bugs or making suggestions for features you can email me at misc @ winextra dot com<br />

      </blockquote>I'm going to be offline for a short period of time during which I will be working on InstallBuilder a bit more; among other things,and when I return I will have a version that will be more widely available as I will be happier with its stability. At that time I will take your recommendation and create the wiki page.

      Ideally I am looking to have a GUI front end that will let a developer create an install package of their application(s) that is equal to anything produced using one of the commercial installer apps; and without having to touch a line of NSIS script code.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I think this current build of NSIS InstallBuilder is stable enough to use for production releases; but I would like good confirmation of this from folks who use NSIS on a regular basis.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      There are two system requirements for using NSIS InstallBuilder:<br />
      <br />
      1. .NET 2.0 Framework installed<br />
      <br />
      2. the newest version of NSIS installed<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I have also setup a support newsgroup on the WinExtra news server for the program - <a href="news://news.winextra.com" target="_blank">news://news.winextra.com</a> is the server address and the group is winextra.help.installbuilder . You can also reach me on MSN Messenger using <a href="mailto:winextra@hotmail.com">winextra@hotmail.com</a>[/email] - just make sure to let me know that it is regarding the program.<br />
