      <p class="post-content"><strong>Need help with System:Call</strong><br />
      I am having problems when trying to call a DLL with System::Call.<br />
      I know for certain that the DLL is being loaded when I attempt to call it (I verified that by using FileMon by SysInternals).<br />
      It is the call itself that is failing. I am going crazy trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. The only thing I know for certain is that the DLL *is* in an accessible location and that it is being loaded when I issue the System:Call. Any help would be very appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      Here is the prototype for the DLL Function:<br />
      typedef BOOL (__stdcall *TCC_FN)(DWORD*);<br />
      BOOL __stdcall MyFunc(DWORD *results);<br />
      <br />
      here is the function I wrote:<br />
      ;--------------------------------------------------<br />
      SetPluginUnload alwaysoff<br />
      Function CallMyFunc<br />
      SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
      System::Call "MyDLL::MyFunc(*i .r1)i.r2"<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK 'Results: $1'<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK 'Return Value: $2'<br />
      <br />
      ; last plugin call must not have /NOUNLOAD so NSIS will be able to delete<br />
      ; the temporary DLL<br />
      SetPluginUnload manual<br />
      ; do nothing (but let the installer unload the System dll)<br />
      System::Free 0<br />
      FunctionEnd<br />
      ;--------------------------------------------------<br />
      The messageboxes that result read as follows:<br />
      Results: 0<br />
      Return Value: error<br />
      <br />
      Valid return values for "Results" ($1) are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32<br />
      Valid result values for "Return Value" ($2) are 1 and 0</p>

      <p class="post-content">If the DLL is surely loaded but the function is not called, it's probably a name mangling problem. Open your DLL with <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" target="_blank">Dependency Walker</a> and make sure the function is really named MyFunc. I guess it's actually named _MyFunc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can't claim to be 100% sure it's loading. I just know that when the call to System::Call is issued, FileMon shows that my setup is doing /something/ with MyDLL.dll. I interepreted that as loading, but I guess it could be /trying/ to load the dll and failing. Is there any way to know if that's the case?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can use another SysInternal tool called DebugView. In your plug-in's DllMain use OutputDebugString and use DebugView to see if DllMain is really called.<br />
      <br />
      Have you tried Dependency Walker?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, I figured it out.<br />
      Posting my solution here in case another bone headed novice does the same thing I was doing.<br />
      Due to my unfamiliarity with the NSIS installer, I was just piecing code together from the samples without a 100% understanding of what it's actually doing. Anyway, I was doing the following<br />
      <b>;---------------------------<br />
      ...<br />
      ReserveFile "MyDLL.DLL"<br />
      ...<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_EXTRACT "MyDLL.DLL"<br />
      ...<br />
      ;---------------------------</b><br />
      <br />
      For some reason, extracting my DLL in that manner was causing my DLL to become corrupted (or, for some reason, simply unusable - I haven't had time to fully investigate). Once I changed the code to be a simple<br />
      <b>File MyDLL.DLL</b><br />
      The function worked perfectly.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for your help, by the way, kichik.</p>

      <p class="post-content">MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_EXTRACT treats the extracted file as an INI file and uses WriteINIStr to write something to it. That's why it corrupts DLLs.</p>
