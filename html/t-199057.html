      <p class="post-content"><strong>Script Generation?</strong><br />
      I'm a network administrator and deploying software to Windows systems is, well, difficult. Way back in my academia years I had access to a copy of Installer WISE which would "reverse engineer any installer". They still have this feature, but the $1200 price tag is a bit of a put off, and I know others need the same capabilities for less money.<br />
      <br />
      What this feature did was it would take a snapshot of the current registry, enviroment, filesystem listings, and then quit. At this point you would go and do whatever you want: change settings, install software, download documents, etc. Many reboots later, you would launch the snapshot system again and it would take a snapshot again and diff them and build an installer script for the diff which you could tweak.<br />
      <br />
      The idea is I can install software or adjust system settings, then deploy a silent installer through the login scripts.<br />
      <br />
      Does NSIS have a plugin/related application/etc that could do something like this? I'm I hoping for a miracle? Any input would be appreciated!</p>

      </blockquote>You could check out PC Magazine's InCtrl5 utility which does just that, for a lot less money ($5.97, actually :-)), and then see if you can parse the report file that it generates:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Total Uninstall can do this logging and can export report to textfile. As I know it's free. Look at <a href="http://www.martau.com/" target="_blank">http://www.martau.com/</a></p>
