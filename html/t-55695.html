      <p class="post-content">Hiya.<br />
      I'm in the process of PiMPing some of my AVS presets. But my computer is majorly screwed. I have two seperate versions of Windows mix-n-matched<a href="http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif" target="_blank">http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif</a>. This means I can't run a dos prompt. So I need the PiMP GUI. But the link in the Developer's section is broken. So do any of you out there have the file I need?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, you are screwed. Even if the PiMP GUI existed, it would still need DOS. NSIS needs DOS.<br />

      <p class="post-content">It's 'cos my bro attempted to install a crappy copy of Windows ME on my Win 98 computer. It was an update thing. So...<br />
      That's as far as I can figure out. I've got no idea. When I try to open a dos promt it just says "You have mismatched windows components installed. Please run setup again".<br />
      And I really can't be bothered. As I'm going away in two days time.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>still you could supply link to pimp guy</strong><br />
      I know you said he didn't need the gui front for pimp, but you could still give other forum readers a link. This is in fact not a one-to-one conversation, but a news group/forum.<br />
      So if you could kindly submit the non-broken link to PiMP GUI. Thanks in advance...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I said that there wasn't a PiMP GUI that compiles the project. There is one, but it only helps manage the PiMP project. I even got confused using it and I have used NSIS for a while now. But the GUI still uses DOS to compile it. Even the Zip2EXE program. The reason for this is the DOS compression is much greater than anything you could cook up for compression in Windows. If you pit a Zip versus the NSIS EXE, NSIS would win WITHOUT it's compression flags.<br />
      <br />
      Now, if you cannot get the DOS prompt in the OS, then there are alternatives, but I don't remember them right now.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS???</strong><br />
      I donno what you're talking about, but I really mean PiMP. Not SuperPiMP/NSIS, but that simple PiMP for plugins and so on. I am sure there was a GUI that could start the makepimp program with you script file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for all your help DJ and everyone else. I ended up PiMPing them up on my bro's computer. And I uploaded it this morning.
