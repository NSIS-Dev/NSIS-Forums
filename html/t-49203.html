It now loads the entire files into memory, which makes it 5 times faster. If you don't want to do this (because of extremely large files), you can still change the MemoryMode setting in the ini file to revert back to the 1.0 engine.<br><br>A GUI is coming soon...<br><br>VPatch is currently based on a routine which scans a file for similar blocks.<br>Ideas on how to generate patches are welcome! (mainly because Clickteam Patch Maker sometimes creates smaller, sometimes bigger patches).

This worked quite well, to speed up lookup I had a number of techniques the main one I can remember off hand (I wrote it years ago) was keeping a table of link lists, each list pointing to matching strings in the original file so if a string began with '0003' it would check all strings identified in the 3rd linked list. I had a lot of different "op codes" to handle short/long as well as near and far strings etc.<br></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Koen van de Sande</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th May 2001 18:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Yes you are right, searching for fragments of the target file is better, and VPatch does that.<br>However, size of these fragments determines the compression - and making fragments too small (currently 256 bytes) will make things quite slow.<br>I'm not really sure what you mean by link lists, but I'm sure it's something similar to what I use.<br>Perhaps making fragments smaller will help. Do you know what kind of fragment size you used?<br>Currently I'm using 256 bytes as standard size because this gives good performance on my PII 233 - but since most people have faster machines nowadays, perhaps I should make it a lot smaller.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dbareis</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">9th May 2001 22:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">My smallest fragment was one byte past the smallest number of codes that I could represent it with, which with the best opcodes was 5 or so bytes!<br><br>If I was looking for a fragment that began with "12345678"x then I would take the first 2 bytes "1234"x and look up the table (entry '1234'x) which pointed to a linked list of source fragments which started with '1234'x.<br><br>Now a better way might be to pick the first byte and one or more bytes futher into the fragement to do a similar thing, so for example if your were insisting on 256 byte fragments, you might pick the first byte and the middle byte. Of course all this is just to improve performance.<br>Note that I wouldn't base my design on what a 233 can do, these won't be around much longer (and I had a 200 when I was writing my program)...<br><br>While relatively fast to build the patch (given sufficient ram) the actual application of a patch was fast.<br><br>With small patches like I was using I found I could do a good job even basing my patch on completely dissimilar/unrelated source files!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Koen van de Sande</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th May 2001 08:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">The actual minimum for fragment size is 16 (or maybe 12).

I just get the first 4 bytes of the block-to-find, and check every 4 bytes of the target files if they match (increasing by 1 each time). If so, it uses the Delphi command CompareMem() to check if the blocks actually match (CompareMem is an Assembler routine of Delphi).<br>How could you do this more efficient?

These 2-byte CRCs are used as indexes into a hash array of linked lists.<br><br>Each linked list item has an offset (the position in the original file where the 64-byte block that had this CRC can be found) and a pointer to the next item.<br><br>To scan for fragments, the code generates a CRC16 for the first 64 bytes of the file. It then looks up the offsets and compares them to those found in the hash array; if there is a match, it computes the length of any of the possible matches in the linked list and picks the longest.<br><br>If it can't find a match, it advances by one byte and computes a new CRC16. Lather, rinse, repeat.<br><br>This is not quite an optimal approach but it very, very good. It is not fast by any means, but it can be speeded up by increasing the block size from 64 to 128 or any other amount. It can be made to perform 'perfect' patches by reducing the block size to 2, but it will then take hours (if not days) to complete even a medium-sized patch.<br><br></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dbareis</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">10th May 2001 22:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">To Koen van de Sande:<br><br>The look up is as described ealier I know where ther first two bytes (and I think I did other "magic") of every string is.

VPatch does something similar, but with the actual data of the fragments (and I increase not by 1 byte, but by BlockSize/2).<br>In theory, BlockSize=2 gives the smallest patches, but you have to watch the overhead of your opcodes. VPatch's biggest opcode is 9 bytes long, so BlockSize=8 would be the bare minimum (because 8/9 are for large blocks).<br><br>General:<br><br>What kind of file sizes should the patch generator be able to handle? VPatch can handle files up to RAM size (or 2GB if you use the old MemoryMode=0 thingy).<br><br>To dbareis:<br><br>I think these lookup tables are not suitable for files larger than 1 MB (because for every 2 bytes you need to store the offset in the look-up table-&gt;1000000*4=4MB of memory for the lookup table of a 1 MB file).<br>Wait a minute, 4 MB isn't so bad...
