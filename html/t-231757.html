I think it's not a NSIS-failure, but maybe you can help.<br><br>Example:<br>The target of the link is a pdf-file on the user's hdd. If there's no pdf-reader installed on the user's system, nothing happens. In the decription of the link isn't mentioned, that a pdf should open, so the user thinks that the link is dead or something.<br><br>Sure it isn't your problem (we should unpack a txt-file or stuff), but maybe you can help me to show an error-message or something like that?

That would be better than showing nothing, but it would be great if i could show it directly after the click on the link. I wonder why the standard-windows-"Choose a program to open the (unknown) file"-message (don't know the English text exactly) doesn't appear. Isn't that possible?<br><br>My alternative would be: check if pdf-reader is installed (like Animaether described),unpack a txt-file if it is not and direct the link to the text-file.<br><br>But txt-files aren't that nice.

Maybe i should invest more time, but i think i ain't got enough of it here on work. Or isn't it that difficult? A few further informations would be great. Or where can i read about it?<br><br>The ExperienceUI? Never heard about it.
