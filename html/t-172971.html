      <p class="post-content"><strong>Wish registry functions worked with variables for rootkeys</strong><br />
      &nbsp; I started to write this piece of code to decide which root key to use for storing certain configuration values in registry.<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />${If} $OSgen == "Win9x" ; Windows 95/98/ME<br />  StrCpy $RootKey "HKLM"<br />${Else} ; WinNT/Win2000,WinXP<br />  ${Select} $UserRights<br />    ${Case2} "User" "Guest"<br />      StrCpy $RootKey "HKCU"<br />    ${Case2} "Admin" "Power"<br />      ${If} ${Context} == "1" ; context selected during instalation, 1=All users, 0=Current user<br />        StrCpy $RootKey "HKLM"<br />      ${Else}<br />        StrCpy $RootKey "HKCU"<br />      ${EndIf}<br />  ${EndSelect}<br />${EndIf}<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      And I wanted to use it this way:<br />
      <br />
      WriteRegStr $RootKey "Software\${Company}\${ProductName}" "Key1" "Value"<br />
      <br />
      But finally I have found that registry functions don't accept variables for rootkey. So this is my feature suggestion for next version of NSIS.

      <p class="post-content">And one more note:<br />
      <br />
      It would be also nice if Start menu would support variable rootkey. Currently it is defined during compilation (!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_REGISTRY_ROOT "HKLM") and does not allow to set it in runtime based on user environment.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I created a macro for writing to the registry, in which I pass HKLM or HKCU depending and then reference it like a normal macro would. This appears to work fine for me.<br />

      your macro works, but it doesn't solve what I wanted. Macro only expands its definition during compilation, nothing more. I wanted to use variable (defined in runtime) for a root key. If I use your macro with variable ($R1):<br />
      <br />
      !insertmacro Write2Reg $R1 "Software\MyCompany" "Chicken" "Egg"<br />
      <br />
      it does not work and I get the same error during compilation:<br />
      <br />
      Usage: WriteRegStr rootkey subkey entry_name new_value_string<br />
      root_key=(HKCR|HKLM|HKCU|HKU|HKCC|HKDD|HKPD)<br />
      <br />
      because WriteRegStr function does not allow first parameter to be variable. Macro cannot change anything with this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I did not check that code. It's indeed just a macro that is processed on compile-time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Summarizing:<br />
      <br />
      Macros parameters in which are used codes are like defines, it is like just putting another name to a variable, like:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>
Section
<br /><br />StrCpy $R0 Test
<br />&gt;!define TEST $R0
<br />MessageBox MB_OK${TEST}
<br /><br />&gt;SectionEnd 
<br />&gt;
</code>
</pre>As the professional way to say it, when you use ${TEST} it is just linking to the buffer that contains the string, but not the string itself, so if a parameter doesn't support variables feature, it doesn't look inside that buffer for the string, it returns the variable name as a string (i.e. $R0).

      <p class="post-content">I think I might have designed a macro that should fix your problem. If you could test the attached macro and if it works I shall convert all of the reg functions into similar macros.<br />

      yes, it is a solution. I wrote something similar for HKLM and HKCU only. But the disadvantage of using macros is that each usage of your WriteRegStr macro (and I have lot of them) is expanded during compilation to 21 instructions. That's why I wrote my wish so some core NSIS developer could enable variable rootkey in WriteRegStr instruction.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks anyway.</p>
