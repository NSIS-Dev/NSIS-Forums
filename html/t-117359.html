This check detect if the file exists and if not it creates it.<br><br>Now back to the ? mark problem, the Entries was overwritten everytime so the CVS thought that there was a error and moved and download a new version everytime. this means that everytime NSIS Update was ran it update the file in the root NSIS directory.<br><br>With the new version the check detect the file and doesnt override the Entries and it just does a cvs update. This mean if you ran NSIS Update 2 times in a row on the second time it wouldnt update any files because the Entries file was correct and the version matched.<br><br>I hope I didnt Confuse you!<br><br>I am really sorry about doing that I am trying to intergrate my program into a program I new nothing about until yesterday. I have spend the last 14hours working on fixing all the little bugs that bugged me including that one. I guess I thought no one would see that. I just that doesnt make me less of a person.

Comments thus far on this thread seem favourable however, well done.<br><br><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Techkid</i><br><b>Just thought you would like to know I have visited your site many time looking for examples and dll's.

This drive was my Backup Drive and Projects Drive. In the event something would happen to my C: drive the D: drive store all my data. So NSIS Update code was lost after hours of trying to retrive data from my 80gb hard that register as 9.4gb and had 2gb free, I gave up. It wasnt a Total failure though the code was in the cvs, well some of it, The UI ans stuff wherent but I was going to create a new UI anyway.<br><br>Second I just visit the NEW NSIS Archive and NSIS Update is there, this is awesome. I really like the new archive.<br><br>Third It will be a few days before I will start coding on NSIS Update. I have some really code ideas for NSIS Update Also I am working on a solution for the Sheduler on none NT machines. The new code was kinda getting bloaty at 254kb need to cut that down. I guess the Hard Drive failure wasnt such a bad thing ( Okay it was, I lost everything music, videos, websites, projects, backups, dvds) arrrrg!<br><br>A Very Upset,<br>Nathan Purciful</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kichik</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">5th January 2003 18:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=9&amp;instances=0,8" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/...&amp;instances=0,8</a><br><br>This page in the archive is dedicated to your NSIS Update.

The files are hidden in the Install Directory\NSIS\.<br><br><blockquote><b>Another idea: I have ISDN internet at home :rolleyes:, and it's not a permanent connection.

This is a limitation of NSIS once INSTFIles beings you can cancel until done.<br><br><blockquote><b>Also: The progressbar should also fill up when downloading.</b></blockquote>This is controled by NSIS Update.<br><br><blockquote><b>Just a suggestion: Make it possible to set that NSIS Updater asks before connecting and downloading files.

Now if you have IE or Windows to connect on no connection then that is something maybe you should change.<br><br><br><blockquote><b>Another suggestion: A reference to the configuration of NSIS Updater in the Controlpanel.</b></blockquote>This is a idea, I havent done any Control Panel work but I sure it cant be that hard. I will look into this because there really need to be a way to change configuration will out edit the config file ( on the other hand there is really good documentation on editing the config file )<br><br><br><blockquote><b>The next suggestion: A program which covers all the NSIS Updater programs + NSIS programs/files/source code/exaples.

The problem is the user would have to have the runtime installed for them to work (aka VB runtime, or .net runtime). You need to write plugins in a language that can be compiled as a standalone dll with no dependancies that aren't already included on all windows machines. So, you can use C,c++, or pascal. There are other languages, but those 3 are the main 3 that can be compiled as standalone dlls.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Techkid</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th January 2003 07:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I just Released NSIS Update 2.0.1 into the wild.

It now has a better debuger you can see what is happing with NSIS Update if you having problems. I added AutoClose (on|off), if NSIS Update errors while Updating it will turn the debuger on. If NSIS Update is updating CVS and cant find CVS95.exe it will tell you to Reinstall NSIS Update. Changed the way NSIS Update Output the Log was 'U NSIS\!Install.bat' now it is 'U !Install.bat'. I have added No Startmenu Shortcuts (also if this is turned off NSIS Update will try closing NSIS shortcuts window).<br><br>Scheduler:<br>I am going to start working on it soon, I want to do some stuff with dialer, like Connect if not connected if we dialed then disconnect on finish.
