like to jumpstart the script with the most basic, i still uses HM NIS for that, i agree eclipse is huge, and i dident see any features better than HM NIS, so ill stick with HM NIS (Can you even compile and run script with eclipse ?)</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">temp4746</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">16th October

notepad but its just a pain in the ass.<br>I dont want to go back to the days of editing html without any syntax highlighting, code-completion, and even a simple button to preview.<br>Everything took ages more than it should.<br><br>I remeber when i once got to edit a web site with dreamweaver just got the layout and everything really easily and then modifyed the code to fix anything i dont like.<br><br>Doing nsis will be pretty much the same thing with notepad.<br><br><blockquote><i>Originally posted by kukomamasan</i><br><b>Can you even compile and run script with eclipse ?</b></blockquote>Yes, both of them pretty much have the same level of features so there are buttons to complie, test and such.<br>And also insert file, color and all that.<br><br>Pretty much copied from hm nis :P</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">AaronLS</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th October 2008 06:16 <abbr

script.<br><br>I used HM Edit I think one time when I was learning NSIS to generate a basic script. Since then I've used Notepad++ to write hundreds of lines of NSIS script.<br><br><a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm" target="_blank">http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm</a><br><br>I just used the NSIS gui for compiling my script for awhile, and then later I created a batch file and finally NANT scripts. I have two nant scripts. One that compiles without any compression(using conditional compile time commands), and one that compiles with compression. The reason I do this is because we are compressing a lot of data, and the compiler compiles much faster with compression disabled. Thus for rpaid modifications and testing the developer doesn't have to wait along time for the compiler to finish.<br><br>Edit: This might be useful to you,<br><a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Notepad_Plus_Plus" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Notepad_Plus_Plus</a></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Yathosho</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">18th October 2008 12:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">been a longtime hm nis user, switched to notepad++ earlier this year.. won't go back, just as lightweight as hm nis and i can use it for so much more.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">iceman_k</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">27th October 2008 14:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">I am the author of EclipseNSIS and my recommendation would be to use whichever IDE works best for you.<br>EclipseNSIS is really targeted for those developers who already use Eclipse and also need to use NSIS.<br>If you don't use Eclipse and need a stand-alone IDE for NSIS, go with HM-NIS or Notepad++, as others have recommended.<br><br>In fact, even I use HM-NIS for quick edits and compilations.<br>The disadvantage of HM-NIS as you know, is that it is extremely out of date. Even with the new syntax files you are not going to get context-sensitive help without manually updating the configuration files.<br>EclipseNSIS, OTOH, dynamically detects NSIS keywords and help topics.<br>Additionally, the EclipseNSIS wizard supports new NSIS features like MUI2 and MultiUser install. It also allows you to save the wizard settings as a template for later reuse.<br>EclipseNSIS also has the auto-update feature where it can detect, download and install the latest NSIS release for you.<br>The big hole in both HM-NIS and EclipseNSIS is the lack of support for nsdialogs.<br>Both, however, support (the now deprecated) InstallOptions, though HM-NIS still has some open bugs in its implementation of this feature.<br><br>The bottom line is that if you want the ultimate lightweight editor go with with Notepad or Notepad++.<br>If you want some more features without having to download a 180 MB platform, go with HM-NIS.<br>If you <b>already</b> use Eclipse (and this is KEY), EclipseNSIS is probably the best bet for you.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/nsis-dev/NSIS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/highlight.pack.js" async></script><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
