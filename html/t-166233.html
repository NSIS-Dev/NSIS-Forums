      <p class="post-content"><strong>Include compiled modules</strong><br />
      I'm running an installer which include a lot of small files.<br />
      <br />
      Once completed, choosing no compression (nor in the script nor at command line), the resulting file is 46MB. Compressed with bz2 is 26MB.<br />
      <br />
      Since the application is divided into modules and the user doesn't always install all of them, I would like to divide even setup into smallest pieces / modules, because it take about 20 mins to compile.<br />
      <br />
      Compressing file before launching NSI compile I save 5 mins.<br />
      <br />
      Dividing into smallest modules, I should save time, because I should re-compile only the one changed.<br />
      And since NSI script file is the one often changed I would save a lot ot time.<br />
      <br />
      Does any one know how to or have any idea to achive this?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can copy external files using CopyFiles or decompress them using plug-ins like ZipDLL and ExtractDLL.</p>

      <p class="post-content">since you're a junior member, i want to add this: since NSIS 2.0 RC1 there's LZMA compression, which in most cases produces smaller installers. in case you weren't aware or didn't try that one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it is prossible using a old computer. I had a computer with Pentium 166, 16 MB RAM before, I compiled my program "Registry Changer - C-Evo" (2.26 MB) with LZMA in 1 minute or more (I don't really know if this is right, but was slow for me...)</p>

      </blockquote>Well, I'm a junior member because I just registered, but I'm using NSIS for almost an year.<br />
      Anyway, any suggestion are well accepted.<br />
      <br />
      The computer I'm compiling with is a P-III @ 800MHz.<br />
      I'm sorry for being not so clear, but 25MB is the size of compressed compiler. The source data are about 100MB. Almost all text of 1Kb to 4Kb, so a lot of small files to be compressed, and I fear this was the cause of so much time to compile.
