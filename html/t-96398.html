A replacement/enhanced GUI for the installer itself, or a text editor for NSIS scripts maybe with development &amp; word processor type features &amp; wizards &amp; help lookup, and/or something that integrates compilation of NSIS, or do you mean just a sort of wizardy thing, maybe WYSIWYG style editor ... like I said what do you mean?<br><br>- Have you considered if what you are proposing is being done already/has already been done? there are quite a lot of NSIS gui tools out there already (although I have only seen one that I personally believe is good enough to use (<a href="http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/NsisWorkbench" target="_blank">NSIS Workbench</a>)).<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to spoil your party, I just want to make sure of what you intend and that it is worth your while, and I'm just curious to know if you maybe have something to say that I really didn't expect :p<br><br>Hmm I guess there is the fact that NSIS Workbench is not open source (at least I don't think it is). I'd be willing to work on an open source project like this as long as it's goals were set out in advance and clearly justified the effort (and that we weren't just duplicating existing effort). The other problem for me is that the real work in NSIS is the scripting and you can't really aid that much with a GUI, it's very installation specific, (and yes I know you can provide context sensitive help etc etc but these don't help actually code a solution to a problem) and so for the amount of work required is a GUI necessary?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Fiffi</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">1st August 2002 11:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Hello Sunjammer,<br><br>i would like to start a OpenSource GUI project that really help to write NSIS installation scripts.<br><br>I have see the NSIS Workbench too, and a lot others.

      <p class="post-content">I believe so because the XML file links to the XSL file (there is a standard syntax for this I believe, it may even be possible to embed the XSL but I don't think that's the preferred solution) and so IE (and other browsers?) can handle the XML by finding and applying the XSL it refers to.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello Sunjammer and LsMoNKi,<br>
      <br>
      basicly i understanded what you want/mean. But i am not able to create XML/XSL - files from the HTML-file. When anyone create the XML/XSL - files from the HTML-file then i try to implement it in N²E.<br>

      <p class="post-content">I didn't expect you to ;) - Someone with more knowledge of XML than me would need to do that (well I can find out how if needs be) and an appropriate structure for the XML would need to be defined... that would probably take a couple of attempts. It's a good little side project for anyone who's interested (if I get time I'll attempt this).</p>

      <p class="post-content">The XML file would still be valuable if we were to distribute with NSIS the HTML generated from the XML because the XML can be parsed more easily by computer programs. It's common for programs to distribute files in different formats, we have an even better excuse in this case since the XML format isn't just meant as an alternative format for humans to read as would a PDF be for example. Distributing both would solve the old browser problem and provide the XML benefits at the same time.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Few Internet browsers have full support for XSL at the moment.<br>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
        Internet Explorer 5 is Bad<br>
        XSL in Internet Explorer 5 is NOT compatible with the official W3C XSL Recommendation.<br>
        <br>
        When Internet Explorer 5.0 was released in March 1999, the XSL standard was still a W3C Working Draft.<br>
        <br>
        Since the final W3C XSL Recommendation is different from the Working Draft, the support for XSL in IE 5 is not 100% compatible with the official XSL standard.<br>
        <br>
        This restriction applies to both IE 5.0 and IE 5.5.<br>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
        Internet Explorer 6 is Better<br>
        Internet Explorer 6 fully supports the official W3C XSL Recommendation.<br>
        <br>
        The XML Parser 3.0 - shipped with Internet Explorer 6.0 and Windows XP - is based on both the W3C XSLT 1.0 and the W3C XPath 1.0 Recommendations.<br>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
        Netscape 6<br>
        Netscape 6 isn't fully supporting the official W3C XSL Recommendation.<br>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
        Internet Explorer MSXML Parser<br>
        MSXML Parser 2.0 is the XML parser that is shipped with IE 5.0.<br>
        <br>
        MSXML Parser 2.5 is the XML parser that is shipped with Windows 2000 and IE 5.5.<br>
        <br>
        MSXML Parser 3.0 is the XML parser that is shipped with IE 6.0 and Windows XP.<br>
        <br>
        According to Microsoft, the MSXML Parser 3.0 is 100% compatible with the official W3C XSL Recommendation: "MSXML 3.0 offers a significant advancement over MSXML 2.5: server-safe HTTP access, complete implementation of XSLT and XPath, changes to SAX (Simple API for XML), higher conformance with W3C standards, and a number of bug fixes."

        i guess it is to be assumed that people would say this, because Slate Blue is, as you so succinctly put it, 'unfinished'.<br>

        <p class="post-content">As an unfinished program there was quite a bit for me to comment on and I guess some if not all of the points I raised would be addressed if there were to be another version.You've written something bigger &amp; better for NSIS than I have so I felt a little guilty reading that page again but after downloading and playing with Slate Blue once more I can't really fault what I said.<br>
        <br>
        Maybe the comments I made will be of interest to anyone who develops a new NSIS editor or similar program. On that front I think people interested in writing a new editor *should* download and try Slate Blue because it has a few interesting ideas, the NSIS dll that can be used for compilation for example.</p>

        <p class="post-content">i think sometime i may finish up Slate Blue, but in Delphi rather than VB.<br>
        <br>
        one thing that I find interesting is that Workbench uses almost all premade components, that comes with sytax coloring, etc etc, while I had to write mine from scratch. of course it'll be a little buggy :)<br>
        <br>
        and i do think that should someone decide to write a new GUI, they should look at both GUI's out there to gain some good ideas. the DLL is kind of a moot point, however, because it is rarely updated (or was when I was writing SB).<br>
        <br>
        no harm done really :) i take all the comments, negative or positive, as a way to improve my software.<br>

        <p class="post-content">The only reason that the NSIS Workbench isn't open source is that it<br>
        uses commercial components, some don't have freeware alternatives of<br>
        the same quality although one or two could be changed to freeware<br>
        components/coded by hand.<br>

        never mind Wise/Installshield is realistic, definitely can't imagine<br>
        it being better (partly due to NSIS "shortcomings" like installing<br>
        locked files), but I suppose aim high! To get anywhere near to<br>
        rivalling them it needs to be run both in editor and gui/wizard mode<br>
        and be able to swap between the two modes as required, not easy.<br>
        <br>

        </blockquote>I'm not sure that it needs to be like them to be better, personally I can't stand InstallShield and it's user interface and wizards. I think the reason NSIS attracts some people is just that, it *isn't* InstallShield. As for the others, well I've never used InnoSetup so I can't comment, but I can't remember seeing a Wise installer I liked the appearance of (mind I can't remember one giving me any trouble either).<br>

        <br>
        It's nice to see some opinions that are different however, most of what has been said so far has been by people agreeing one way or another :D<br>
        <br>
        As for NSIS Workbench, yeah I liked it. The sign of a good app is one I actually find myself using, NSIS Workbench made the grade on that test.

        <p class="post-content">I could try and remove as much of the commercial components as I can but by the sounds of it people like the idea of starting their own project from scratch, and why not.<br>
        <br>
        I haven't quite worked out what the aim for the new project is other than aiming to be a rival for... If it's a similar type of program to the Workbench then that, whilst not pointless, seems a bit of a waste of coding effort and trying to get mine open source but requiring certain commercial components to be able to develop it isn't such a bad idea. If the project is more ambitious which would really mean a two way editor/gui in the same way as Wise then that's something that would need to be started from scratch.<br>
        <br>
        One final comment is that I think work needs to be done on the NSIS installers GUI, the bit the user sees. Unless things have changed then it looks practically the same as it always had. When it was first released it looked OK but these days looks distinctly old fashioned and I personally wouldn't use it for anything other than distributing freeware. Definately could do with a make over (unless someones done, this haven't kept up to date with the forum recently).<br>

        <p class="post-content">Guys,<br>
        You have been discussing about a frontend I think that I have a brilliant idea ;-).<br>
        <br>
        All the "front-ends" that I have seen for NSIS are just better text editors, loaded with more-and-more functionality suited for NSIS script developing.<br>
        <br>
        How about a "Object Oriented" front end, where the user gets to see the different stages of the installer (say a tabbed interface) where he gets to type in the necessary modification for the different texts, looks, etc.<br>
        <br>
        e.g: if, say, he chooses "XP style" on, the the picture changes from the default look to a "XP style" image.<br>
        <br>
        What this does is that it gives a wizard-like appeareance to the "front-end". This will make users switch from the easy-to-use interfaced installers to NSIS !!! Yay !!!<br>
        <br>
        The script editor also will have to be a part of this "NSIS Designer" so that any modifications in the settings in one place will reflect in the script in the script editor, kinda like ISTool for innosetup.<br>
        <br>
        How 'bout that idea !!!<br>

        <p class="post-content"><strong>NSIS Editor - Venis 1.0.3</strong><br>
        Hello everyone,<br>
        <br>
        I have just added a new feature to Venis so now I can say it is more than just a text editor. <a href="http://www.spaceblue.com/venis/" target="_blank">http://www.spaceblue.com/venis/</a><br>
        <br>
        I added a new MessageBox Wizard. I designed the dialog for future use, if I get positive feedback.<br>
        <br>
        To use the MessageBox Wizard, you drag the new "MessageBox Wizard" icon to the line of your choosing in your NSIS code. Then when you drop the MessageBox wizard (let go of the mouse click), a MessageBox Wizard appears.<br>
        <br>
        The MessageBox Function Wizard will put the function arguments together for you. The text message for the message box will be properly quoted using the first logical quote that was not used in the message in this order: ", ', `. The Select button allows you to select one message box option at a time. Each option is appended to the current options. Return checks are selected in the same fashion. At any time you may press the F1 key to open the makensis.htm file to the specified MessageBox section.<br>
        <br>
        Please check it out and give me some feedback. <a href="http://www.spaceblue.com/venis/" target="_blank">http://www.spaceblue.com/venis/</a><br>
        <br>
        Thanks,<br>

        <p class="post-content">What I would like to see in this project is a UI/IO designer. To edit the UI you can use my CResourceEditor and CDialogTemplate classes, they are fairly simple (I think :D), all you have to do is add the UI wrapper around it to create a designer. I would also want a simple mode that hides all of the wizard stuff.<br>

        If any help is needed with anything, I am always here. ;)<br>

        <p class="post-content">Hi,<br>
        I was talking about a NSIS designer...with a frontend. Here is a sample I hav done using VB :(<br>
        <br>
        As of now, the "NSIS Designer" does nothing, it's just a sample feel of how the actual "NSIS Designer" could be.<br>
        <br>
        P.S.<br>
        You will require the "standard VB runtimes" and the "tabctl32.ocx" to get this piece of software running :)</p>
