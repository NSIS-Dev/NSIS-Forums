      Now in the case of Apache I noticed in my registry that the ImagePath also includes options to apache so you'll need to strip out just the path from the string you get back in $0. Note: I have not tried this, I don't have time :(.

      <p class="post-content">Ohh,...<br>
      so thx for your time!<br>
      <br>
      Can anybody tell me how to write the result of "Registry-reading" into a file, parsing it, to get the missing parameters written at the end of String, rename it (the written file) to *.bat, execute it and delete it afterwards?<br>
      <br>
      Or more simple (as I think)<br>
      1.) At "install-time" I write a *.bat (I know how to:)) which has all the parameters in it to uninstall (at least an unmodified, original installed service).<br>
      <br>
      2.) So my problem is as mentioned early in this post, to bring this file to the uninstaller!!!!<br>
      <br>
      The uninstaller should content this *.bat, to extract it at uninstallation-time, call/execute it and delete it the next step.<br>
      <br>
      How can this be achieved?<br>
      <br>
      Chris<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      P.S.: So as Kichik mentioned above, but before the uninstaller is built, the files have to be modified to get the path. S**t, how should I explain:<br>
      <br>
      Hmmm, I do all the file manipulation with the "search &amp; replace" function from the Archive. So I need to have the files (*.bat) to be written at iunstallation-time and packed into the uninstaller. Otherwise at least the /uninstall function of the services will fail, not the stops as I can call them by "net stop servicename"</p>

      <p class="post-content">For the "more simple" approach :-<br>
      <br>
      You could get the uninstaller to write the bat file using FileWrite in the Uninstaller part of the .nsi (icky I know but the File commands are for the installer, not the uninstaller). Then you just execute it as you would execute anything else from an .nsi, i.e. using Exec, or ExecWait, or nsExec::xxx etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, but the uninstaller is written at compile time, not installation time, right? So I will never get the unmodified installation path!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I attached an example.nsi, which I wrote for this. Will it work? Can somebody take a look?<br>
      <br>
      What I want is: Create a file, manipulate it, pack it to the uninstaller. At uninstallation time call the file, and delete the directory with the included files. As mentioned earlier, the file should never appear visible for the user, because of probably deletion. so I want to pack it with the uninstaller.<br>

      <p class="post-content">Why not just execute it without a batch file? Get the ImagePath into, lets say, $1, and then use:<br>
