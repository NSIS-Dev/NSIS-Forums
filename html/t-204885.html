      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the translation. But the supplied language id is invalid (10FF). I couldn't find the id anywhere. Without a valid language id, Breton will not be correctly selected. What is the correct language id?</p>

      There is no LCID for Breton, this is an issue we have since a long time and are still fighting with MS to be recognized...<br />
      <br />
      Is this a so big issue for NSIS ? As far as I understand NSIS won't be able to select automatically the Breton choice in the list of languages, at launch tim ... but as far as there is no localization of Windows in this language, I guess this does not matter :)<br />
      <br />
      If the user just selects the language in the list, is it going to work ?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">If there's no language id, it's true that it won't be selected automatically anyway. But, it might overlap with another language. I'll take a look and see if zero is a good option to avoid that. If not, is there a totally invalid language id you've been using for Breton? If Breton is based on French, something like MAKELANGID(LANG_FRENCH, 0x20) might be a good idea. MAKELANGID's documentation even states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        For a user-defined sublanguage, usSubLanguage is a value in the range 0x20 to 0x3F. All other values are reserved for system use.

      It is true to say that Breton is a language of France, but linguistically speaking, it has no link with it (French is a Latin language, Breton a Celtic one).<br />
      <br />
      I am not sure that what you suggests is the best solution: See what they did with Basque (language of Spain/France with no link with Spanish/French) or Welsh (language of UK with no link with English): those two languages have their own LCID which is not a SUB ID of LANG_SPANISH or LANG_ENGLISH ...<br />
      <br />
      In my humble opinion, the best (less worst...) solution would have been to create a LANG_CELTIC main lang id, with SUB_LANG_WELSH, SUB_LANG_BRETON, SUB_LANG_IRISH, SUB_LANG_SCOTTISH &amp; SUB_LANG_MANX as subids... But there is an issue : there is actually no LANG_CELTIC main language spoken !!!<br />
      <br />
      If you can force the LCID to 0 for the moment it will be just fine toi us :) and it is true to say that $10FF was definitely not a good default choice,<br />
      <br />
      Have a good time,<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, then it seems MAKELANGID(0x0200, 0x20) == 33280 is the best solution. According to MSDN, it's a user-defined language and that seems like what we need. This way, it will never be automatically selected unless it's the only or first language used. Is that OK with you?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Great !<br />
      <br />
      I did not even know it was possible to use the MAKELANGID(0x0200, 0x20) api to specify a user-defined language id ! Seems that we found a case where it will be useful !<br />

      <br />
      BTW, here is the UNICODE language matrix. I don't know why MS did not define LCIDs for all the (missing) languages ...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi Kichik,<br />
      <br />
      At last Microsoft Vista is bringing an official LCID for Breton... should be nice to update the Breton NSIS files with it now ?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi!<br />
      So we did update the Breton version files again, with the LCID initialized to 1150 (0x47e) = MAKELCID(MAKELANGID(LANG_BRETON, SUBLANG_BRETON_FRANCE),SORT_DEFAULT)<br />
      <br />
      The language files can be downloaded at:<br />

      <br />
      I guess other files in the NSIS engine should have to be updated too, including the windows compiler you use &amp; the latest SDK (MSVC 2005).<br />
      Anyway let us know &amp; keep up the good work!<br />

      BTW, NSIS doesn't use LCID in the language files, only LANGID. SORT_DEFAULT is 0, so it came out the same in this case.</p>
