So heres the final product. I hope its compatble with all win32 systems. Can people have a quick look, and if theres any noticable bugs or suggestions please let me know. I'm still learning so if you have improvments, please post the code so I can see. For eg, if you think an image on the left would be good, please post the code for it (since I dont know how).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Afrow UK</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">2nd February 2006 07:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">You're using Classic UI not using Modern UI.
