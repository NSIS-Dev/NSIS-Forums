      Also I would add some more verbose output to installer, so you can find out whether it is your .NET detection that failed to detect the missing .NET framework or the installer that failed to execute.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can tell you with almost perfect certainty that it has to do with the exewait function not waiting on some systems. I searched around a bit over the weekend, and I am a little unclear about how to resolve that problem; it would seem there is something I can add to the specific line, like<br>
      <br>
      ExecWait "$INSTDIR\dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe <b>/norestart /passive /showfinalerror"</b><br>
      <br>
      but I am unclear where these arguments are found, and there does not seem to be a specific one for my installer, that or I am not looking for the right thing.<br>
      <br>
      The Installer in question works fine on an XP 32/64, and on all the windows 7 32/64 machines I have set up in a VM environment. However it seems to fail on just a few systems; since these are client machines, I have limited information about their systems/settings, and I am not sure what I am looking for.<br>
      <br>
      The macro is defined in an add on written by David Grinberg you can check it out here<br>

      <p class="post-content">Try like this:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>ExecWait `"$INSTDIR\dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe" /norestart /passive /showfinalerror`</code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      It's important to enclose command-line arguments that <i>might</i> contain whitespaces within quotes, such as the path to the installer! However you must put the whole command-line into quotes (a different kind of quotes), because ExecWait expects a single operand.<br>
      <br>
      Also be aware that some installer executable (SFX files), which have <i>not</i> been made with NSIS, will only extract the setup files to some folder and then invoke the actual installer program from there. In that case 'ExecWait' would only wait for the first executable, but not for the second executable that was launched by the first one. This can still work if the first executable waits for the second one. But if it doesn't, then it won't work. AFAIK an ExecWait() that will also wait for all child-processes of the created process doesn't exist in NSIS.

      </blockquote>1) Don't use .NET, there are plenty of alternatives that don't require to user to install a bloated framework separately. With GUI framworks like Qt or WxWidgets you put a few runtime DLL's into the install folder (or even link everything statically into the EXE file) and that's it.<br>
      <br>
      2) Add the required version of the .NET framework to the system requirements of your software and simply abort setup with an error message, if the framework is not installed yet. AFAIK obtaining the .NET framwrok via Windows Update is the recommend way anyway. But you can also offer the user to open the .NET download site in the browser, within your error message dialog.<br>

      </blockquote>As said before, if that is really the problem, it's a problem of the individual redistributable installer and only the developers of the installer could fix the issue. If a self-extractor extracts setup files and then launches setup, the self-extractor is supposed to wait for the setup program to terminate and perform a clean-up afterwards. At least when running in non-interactive mode.<br>
      <br>
      (I don't use .NET, but all other redistributable installers I came across so far work that way. And it would be strange if only .NET doesn't)

      <p class="post-content">Sorry to come off as a complainer, that is not the case. I don't really have time to learn and port over to QT, I have inherited this software from a previous developer, and the rate at which I have to create deliverables prevents me from making any meaningful or fundamental changes, let alone learn a system like QT. I have enough time to get small things done here and there. I was hoping to keep things in the installer department about the same for the newest version of the software. Ill keep looking; thanks again.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Another option would be:<br>
      <br>
      Manually extract the .NET installer redistributable package. Something like 7-Zip or Universal Extractor should be able to do the job. Then make your installer extract the .NET setup files to a temporary folder (you can use $PLUGINSDIR or a sub-folder thereof) and let ExecWait() run the actual installer executable directly. NSIS will clean-up the $PLUGINSDIR folder automatically when the installer exists.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Today I started the above mentioned process, since I'm still new to NSIS I am not sure that I have gone about this correctly.<br>

      I extracted all of the files from the redistributable placing them in a folder called redist.<br>
