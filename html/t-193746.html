      <p class="post-content"><strong>A good installer design?</strong><br />
      Hi All,<br />
      Well first of all a big round of applause for NSIS.<br />
      Secondly, an applause for me as i managed to convince my management to use NSIS against InstallShield :D .<br />
      <br />
      We are in the process of designing an installer to deploy our web application along with tomcat.<br />
      I have managed to get a hang of most of the things except one (so far ;-)). Here it goes...<br />
      <br />
      1. Welcome page click Next<br />
      2. Page 2 click next<br />
      3. Page 3 is a dummy information page which shows the progress of the tomcat installation with back, next and cancel buttons disabled.<br />
      Now i would like that as soon as the installation is complete, "Next" button should be enabled automatically.<br />
      Somehow i cant manage to find a way to enable the next button.<br />
      <br />
      My Questions:<br />
      1. Is it possible using my approach?<br />
      2. Is there a better way in use or someone is aware of?<br />
      <br />
      thanks in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Start the Tomcat application with the ExecWait command, so NSIS will wait until Tomcat finishes.<br />
      <br />
      I hope this helps<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the reply...<br />
      <br />
      I am already doing something similar. As soon as the user goes from page 2 to page 3 (the tomcat installation page), the next, back and cancel buttons are shown disabled with the tomcat installer being run in the background using the<br />
      ExecWait tomcatsetup.exe /S /D="blah"<br />
      My problem is that once the installation is complete i would like to enable the next button.<br />
      <br />
      Hope i am able to make myself a bit clear now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why don't you use the banner plugin (see contrib\banner) to notify the user of the progress of the tomcat installer ?<br />
      I use the banner plugin to show my users that a database upgrade is beeing run silent.<br />
      The procedure is someting like:<br />
      - Hide installer window<br />
      - show banner<br />
      - ExecWait the program silent<br />
      - After the program finishes then<br />
      - Hide Banner<br />
      - Show installer window<br />
      - Display error messages (if any)<br />
      <br />
      I'll have to check if your solution is usable.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Crisp...but unfortunately i had already found the solution.<br />
      Your solution is more elegant though... perhaps i will incorporate the changes if i have some time in the end.<br />
      BTW, do you have any idea on accessing sql server from nsis? I have a post based on an issue i am facing. Would you be kind enough to read it and reply please?</p>
