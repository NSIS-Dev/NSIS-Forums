      <p class="post-content"><strong>MUI + Messagebox plugin - Bug?!</strong><br />
      Hello world,<br />
      <br />
      I came across the following bug when using MUI and the messagebox plugin: When I define my own MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_ABORT function and use messagebox::show in it, then an additional (undesired) button is shown when "Cancel" is pressed for the first time.<br />
      <br />
      I have stripped down the error to the following small example. I found that...<br />
      a) When you press "Cancel" for the first time, an undesired third button is shown.<br />
      b) All subsequent uses of the Cancel button show only the "Yes" and "No" buttons (as desired).<br />
      c) When I use msssagebox:show in the "Section" instead of the custom function, the bug does not show up.<br />
      <br />
      Is this a known bug or am I doing something wrong? What can I do to resolve the issue?<br />
      <br />
      Jens</p>

      <p class="post-content">you need to ensure that that stack is clear before calling the messagebox function (push/pop combination from what i remember). one day i may eventually re-write the lost code of that plugin so as not to have that issue (inbetween all of my winamp duties)<br />

      <blockquote>
        you need to ensure that that stack is clear before calling the messagebox function
      </blockquote>How would I do that best? In my example, none of my own code is executed before the plugin is called (only NSIS and MUI code). So how can I save all current stack values and restore them afterwards - all without exactly knowing how many values are on the stack?

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Pleeeeaaaaase do so. Winamp duties will surely happily wait some time in favor of NSIS... ;)

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Messagebox Plugin - Reproducible Error</strong><br />
      Hello world,<br />
      <br />
      I learned that the messagebox plugin requires an empty stack before calling messagebox::show, so I wrote two auxiliary macros _MSGBOX_CLEAR_STACK and _MSGBOX_RESTORE_STACK to to the job. But now I frequently get an "unhandled Win32 exception" if I use the plugin in the MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_ABORT function.<br />
      <br />
      I have stripped down the issue to a small test script that is attached to this posting.<br />
      Could somebody please be so kind to have a look at it and see if you can reproduce the error?<br />
      <br />
      1. Run the compiled "Test.exe".<br />
      2. Proceed to the second page (directory selection).<br />
      3. Press "Cancel" and confirm with "Yes".<br />
      <br />
      At this point the Visual Studio debugger pops up claiming an unhandled Win32 exception. This does not always happen, but still about every second time I run the installer. The same thing happens on at least two other computers.<br />
      <br />
      My system:<br />
      Windows XP SP2 with latest patches, NSIS 2.31, Visual Studio 2005 SP1 installed (that's why the debugger pops up when the error occurs).<br />
      <br />
      I am not quite sure if it's a bug in the plugin, or in MUI itself, or if it's just me doing something wrong. Any helpful comments are welcome.<br />
      <br />
