      <p class="post-content"><strong>Installation verification</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      Not sure if this question was already posted here...<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way to prevent the user from not installing the product,<br />
      if they have already installed the product on one machine?<br />
      What I mean is, say if a user installed the product on machine "ABC",<br />
      then copy the setup.exe to an other machine "DEF" and start<br />
      installing the same product on that other machine.<br />
      How do I prevent the user to not install the product on "DEF"?<br />
      <br />
      One of the ways I thought of resolving the problem is by appending<br />
      the SYSTEM_INFO at the end of setup.exe file during the first<br />
      install. For subsequent installs, verify the SYSTEM_INFO to see<br />
      if the user has moved/copied the binary to other machines, if so<br />
      STOP the installation.<br />
      But don't know how to implement the above scenerio using NSIS?<br />
      Does anyone have a better solution, or can anyone help me with<br />
      the NSIS script for implementing the above solutions.<br />
      <br />
      Many thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This won't work, it's still possible to copy the installer to two different machines before running the first install.<br />
      <br />
      Why do you want to restrict the number of installations? I think that it is a bad idea, the user should be able to reinstall the software.<br />
      <br />
      Just make a good license, protections never really work anyway.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can't write to the installer exe because it is in use too...<br />
      The best solution you can have is write something on the server side. A user called snowchyld has done something similar, he might help you better.</p>
