With the self extractor possibility you can even make the installer available for anyone (even if they don't have winzip). Just use winzip to span... that's all... And it is really the easiest way. And the cost is only minor: an additional header for the zipexe of around 30k. Well, with 2Gb's to put on a disk, this 30Kb does not really make a difference ;)<br><br>By the way, how are you planning to send all these disks to your customers?

That is still the safest way to distribute. If you just have 1 huge file and one disk gets lost/damaged, the rest cannot be used anymore...<br><br>Besides that, using separate cabinet files, it is much easier to distribute specific components in separate files instead of in one huge container. Most components of huge programs have a lot of files in all kind of dirs. This would mean that you have to extract all files by manually addressing them. Instead, you can make a cab/zip for each component, containing dir info such that extraction automatically places files in the right dir. That would work with just one command.<br><br>But that point is of course only valid for large programs/installers with a lot of options/components.<br><br>But for small programs/installers (&lt;5Megs), splitting could be usefull, but I still wonder if it is not far more easy to use zip/unzip dll and control the extraction yourself. Besides that, are you using disks? Actually, I did not use disks anymore for almost 4 now. And since Win 3.1 left us, I actually never met an installer on a disk :) But hey, who am I...<br><br>/me laughing about those good old Dos 6.22 and QBasic days :D<br><br>:-H</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">n0On3</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">25th November 2002 19:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Smile2Me</i><br><b>If you just have 1 huge file and one disk gets lost/damaged, the rest cannot be used anymore...<br></b></blockquote>Yes, you are right.

The problem is there is little need anymore for being able to split files across floppy disks as they are used so seldom these days. Unfortunately, this is something that would be be on the bottom of lists of things to add to NSIS.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Dick4</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th November 2002 02:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">can we make a poll like someone did for the license check box?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Joost Verburg</span><br><span class="post-time small text-muted">26th November 2002 11:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></span></p><p class="post-content">Polls are quite useles.<br><br>Of course there are some people who would like to see such a feature.
