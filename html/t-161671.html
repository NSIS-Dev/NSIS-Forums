      <p class="post-content"><strong>how to begin getting ready a script for future translations (different languages)?</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      <br />
      This really wasn't too high on the todo list but I've finally made it to the task. After reviewing some example scripts and actual scripts, I am at a pause, regarding how exactly or what exactly is the best approach to getting ready a script for translation.<br />
      <br />
      I cannot provide translations other than english and that already seems to be done. I would like my script translated so to present it in different languages.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a really good guide on a best approach to doing this? Basically, I would like the small popup at the beginning which prompts the user to pick a language. There after the magic.<br />
      <br />
      What is the best approach as I have scripts both example and real which differ very much in their approach.<br />
      <br />
      I would like to hear what a guru who is already doing this has got to say. I would like and really appreciate some tips and pointers. Thanks a million!</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS 2 supports multilingual installers. See the example scripts like "Examples\Modern UI\MultiLanguage.nsi".<br />
      <br />
      For you own strings, you can use langauge strings (see Users Manual). If you want other people to help translating, you might want to put these strings in include files.<br />
      <br />
      See <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=132&amp;instances=0,44" target="_blank">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/...instances=0,44</a></p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Thank you Joost</strong><br />
      Thank you Joost,<br />
      <br />
      I did dibble and dabble with the file you've mentioned and compared it to the HM NIS EDIT setup script. I've seen them differ in a few ways and just wanted some confirmation.<br />
      <br />
      Also very much thanks for that link to the archive. I will work with it later on today. Am really tired and seriously need a break from work.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a million for your time Joost, hopefully all will go well :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello Joost,<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a million! I've got 95% of the language work out of the way thanks to you and the help manual. I got one question in which I do not think there is a positive answer but a question I need to ask.<br />
      <br />
      Creating a language file effects the .nsi and .nsh installation scripts only? I mean as far as INI files go for the custom screens, their language has to be *hardcoded* into the INI's?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again Joost</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can write a LangString into the INI. For example:</p>
      <pre>
<code>LangString ls ${LANG_ENGLISH} "some ini text"<br />Function customPage<br />  WriteINIStr $PLUGINSDIR\myINI.ini "some section" "some value" $(ls)<br />FunctionEnd</code>
</pre>

      <p class="post-content">Hello Kichik,<br />
      <br />
      I am so glad to know this did not need to be hardcoded! I successfully completed this task thanks to you and Joost.<br />
      <br />
      This installer keeps amazing me... Excellent work!</p>
