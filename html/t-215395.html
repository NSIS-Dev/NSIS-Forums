      How would I Remove an UnInstaller Component from the list<br />
      if a File Exist on the install System.<br />
      <br />
      Here is a Sample bit of Code to Show me With....<br />
      <br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />;--------------------------------<br />;--------------------------------<br />; Uninstaller Pages<br />;--------------------------------<br /><br />  !insertmacro MUI_UNPAGE_COMPONENTS<br />  !insertmacro MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES<br /><br />or Non MUI<br /><br /><br />UninstPage components<br />UninstPage instfiles<br /><br /><br />;--------------------------------<br />;--------------------------------<br />; Uninstaller<br />;--------------------------------<br /><br />Section "-Un.UninstallHiddenRequiredFiles"<br />  Delete "$INSTDIR\Uninst.exe"<br />  Delete "$Desktop\Uninstaller.lnk"<br />SectionEnd<br /><br />Section "Un.Compoment1"<br />#MYCODE<br />SectionEnd<br /><br />Section "Un.Compoment2"<br />#MYCODE<br />SectionEnd<br /><br />Section "Un.Compoment3"<br />#MYCODE<br />SectionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I have a Component Page for Installation too. So If one of the Installation Sections was left off, What I want to do is Use the IfFileExists on a file that would have been installed. how do I incorporate that so a Component doesn't make the list to try and<br />
      uninstall?<br />
      <br />
      That way Only What the User Installed Shows as an Option to Uninstall.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can do so in un.onInit function, by invoking SectionSetFlags and SectionSetText commands. You should declare section index for each involved section.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Again Hooklee, This is Helping for sure.<br />
      <br />
      A few things that Happen with that Code. When I install<br />
      Readme_01.txt It wants to only Give the option to Uninstall<br />
      Readme_02.txt !!!!<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Also if I choose to Install Both it Doesn't Show Either in<br />
      the Uninstaller Page.<br />
      <br />
      Altho I'm Sure a Simple Switch in something will Clear both<br />
      things up...<br />
      <br />
      I will Mess around with it and post Back if I Get it to<br />
      Work as I intended...<br />
      <br />
      And thanks because this is Definitely Working along the<br />
      Way I wanted.... What would Coding be without Bugs along<br />
      the way Anyway ????<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok Here is what Fixed it...<br />
      <br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />Function un.onInit<br />     IfFileExists $INSTDIR\Readme_01.txt 0 +3<br />     SectionSetFlags ${Section3} 0<br />     SectionSetText ${Section4} ""<br /><br />     IfFileExists $INSTDIR\Readme_02.txt 0 +3<br />     SectionSetFlags ${Section4} 0<br />     SectionSetText ${Section3} ""<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      However I needed this for Three Components so I started<br />
      building from that Example and Ended up with a Few probs<br />
      Along the way..<br />
      <br />
      I will Keep at it, And if you or anyone else can still<br />
      think of something please let me know !!!!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Here is an update on that Code and what I have found<br />
      it Does... Which you will see the Reasons it will<br />
      Trouble More Components along the way.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      This Disables it with the 0 at the End.<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />     SectionSetFlags ${SectionANY} 0<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      Also you can Still Select it if the Next line of Code is<br />
      not there.<br />
      <br />
      So you can still Select it and choose to uninstall it or<br />
      not... It just shows up as not checked. kinda like the<br />
      code /o Which does the same thing. which is why I'm sure<br />
      you put The Next Line there. Thinking if it is Disabled<br />
      then Why See it so they won't be able to Select it again<br />
      Perhaps.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />     SectionSetText ${SectionANY} ""<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Ok so If the FIle is there This will Not Uninstall<br />
      (SectionAny) nor Does it Show up as a Choice to Uninstall<br />
      on the Component page.<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />Function un.onInit<br />IfFileExists $INSTDIR\Readme.txt 0 +3<br />SectionSetFlags ${SectionANY} 0<br />SectionSetText ${SectionANY} ""<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Ok so If the FIle is there This will Uninstall<br />
      (SectionAny) and Does Not Show up as a Choice as an Option<br />
      on the Component page.<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />Function un.onInit<br />IfFileExists $INSTDIR\Readme.txt 0 +3<br />SectionSetText ${SectionANY} ""<br />FunctionEnd<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Anyway it Works with two Sections but Three it Can't<br />
      Hide the other two and Not Still Work Correct because<br />
      the other two have to Verify whether it's there and<br />
      Would just X each other out.<br />
      <br />
      I am still Looking for a Good way to go about this....<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for Any Help.... Also thanks Hooklee atleast this<br />
      works so far with just two Sections... Thats a Plus...<br />

      </blockquote>I have tested my code. It works very well.<br />
      <br />
      You SHOULD use "IfFileExists $INSTDIR\Readme_01.txt +3", not "IfFileExists $INSTDIR\Readme_01.txt 0 +3". I am puzzled why you have problems with the fommer command but get it to work with the latter command.<br />
      <br />
      "IfFileExists $INSTDIR\Readme_01.txt 0 +3" means hide and unselect the section when the file exists! It is not what you want.

      <br />
      That Works !!!!!! You had it Right the First Time I guess.<br />
      Thanks for pointing that bit of Code out ...<br />
      <br />
      Actually at this point I have no Idea How that 0 Got in<br />
      there if you didn't Originally put it there, But Yep After<br />
      I removed it .... My Installer then ran just Perfectly fine,<br />
      Just the Way I wanted it to. My Mistake Caused a Fork<br />
      in the Code .... ehh I mean Road ... :)<br />
      <br />
      ... Don't Worry If anything I Did Learn more with that 0<br />
      There than without it ... That is more Important than<br />
      anything ....<br />
      <br />
      So I got to Words for you .............<br />
      <br />
      Thank You !!!!<br />
