      <p class="post-content"><strong>Newbie question: ExecWait problem launching java or javaw</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      Within one of the sections of my install script, I call ExecWait to execute/launche a little java app, that sets up a user preference file based on a selection that the user has made from the app. When I try to run the installer - nothing happens, that is my little java app does not appear. The installer properly installs everything else thats needs but does not display the app. I know that the installer is executing the ExecWait, however, I do not know why my app is not showing up. I've tried hiding the installer but still my app is not visible. Any suggestions as to what I could be doing wrong??</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try messagebox'ing your string that you are using to execute javaw. If nothing is happening when you call execwait then execwait is failing. This is generally because of a bad path in your string.</p>

      Thanks for your suggestion.<br />

      I used the MessageBox and set the text to be displayed. The path is correct. I executed it in a command window and it worked - the app was launched. Next, I created a shortcut and tried to Exec and ExecWait the shortcut, still no luck. I can run the shortcut if I double click on it and have my app display, however, I still can not get the app to be displayed using Exec or ExecWait for either the text I specify or through a shortcut.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just a hunch, but maybe your Java application is looking for some other classes and can't find them because it looks in the wrong directory? In this case you need to set the current directory to the class file directory. To do this read this post (it is a work around):<br />
