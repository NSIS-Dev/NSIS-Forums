<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cervantes</div><div class="date">18th August 2004, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing an installer to be used in Cambodia where they speak Khmer (Cambodian). Users who will be using the installer already have the proper fonts installed and their systems configured.<br />
<br />
According to this page<br />
<br />
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/languages.html<br />
<br />
Khmer has no Windows constant defined but does have a Win Code (0x53).<br />
<br />
I have a few questions:<br />
<br />
- The language ID shown by MakeLangId.exe, what is this number based on? Thought it might be the decimal equiv of the Win Code but it isnt. What would I use for the Khmer.nlf Language ID?<br />
<br />
- since there is no Win32 LANG_KHMER define, what should I use for the Khmer.nsh line '!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGEFILE_BEGIN &quot;Khmer&quot;'<br />
<br />
- Has anyone experimented with the Language Selection Dialog switching the system region to the appropiate Code Page on language selection so that say Russian users on English Windows can see the correct font &amp; not garbage? Then on exiting the installation switch back to the original code page. This would only work on WinXP &amp; Win2K I think.<br />
<br />
- Where can I find the sources to the binaries under ${NSISDIR}/bin ?<br />
<br />
thanks for your assistance,<br />
<br />

Its source code is now in CVS and is also attached. I don't know why I haven't uploaded it before.<br />
<br />
You could try using the code page from that website. If Windows supports the Khmer code page, it should work.<br />
<br />
For switching without rebooting you can try Nolybab (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=346).</div></div><hr />
