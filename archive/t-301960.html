I am compiling a script using the modern theme and also using MUI Orange Vista Theme for the icons and images. I have a problem thought. I have 2 pages where i am adding files to the installer. When i comment out the second part and i get an installer of approximately 400MB everything works fine. But when i include all the files, the installer is 575 MB and it has no icon. Nothing else changes in the script. Only the &quot;;&quot; in the following line: <br />
<br />
;File /r &quot;files\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me please? I tried talking to someone in the irc channel but no one answers me.</div></div><hr />

This is not a nsis problem, its a problem with windows/explorer, see http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=156086</div></div><hr />
