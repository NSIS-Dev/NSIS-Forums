<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CodeSquid</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">ExtractDLL is a extension DLL for NSIS. It can decompress files <br />
which were compressed with compressfile.exe before. It is especially<br />
useful in combination with NSISdl so that you don't have to <br />
download large files uncompressed.<br />
<br />
In short: If you use NSISdl to download large files, you may use this extension DLL so that you can transfer the files compressed.<br />
You compress the files and put them on your server. Then your installer downloads the files with NSISdl and decompresses them with ExtractDLL.<br />
Of course there may be other reasons to use ExtractDLL, but it's up to you to find them.<br />
<br />
Tested with NSIS 2.0a2</div></div><hr />

<br />
unless there is already one that i've missed..<br />
:weird:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CodeSquid</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">unzip? I won't use zip file in installers, zips have way too large headers :(<br />
<br />
Now I'm writing a program that builds very basic archives and compresses them. ExtractDLL will be able to decompress them and some simple NSIS script functions will extract the individual files from the archive.<br />
That will be much better than the old and ugly :D zip files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snowchyld</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm well at the moment i'm trying to write an installer that pulls zips from the server [does that fine] and then unzips them, the thing is, the guys who are using the file uploads always zip them [lowest common denominator, and the update packaging which downloads them also unzips..<br />
<br />
how difficult will it be to write a straight up unzip dll for NSIS [yeah im slowly getting back into C, hence the questions :weird:]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CodeSquid</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">It should not be very difficult to write such an extension DLL, I actually have some source code for zip uncompression on my disk.</div></div><hr />
