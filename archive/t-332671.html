<br />
I have been struggling with this for 2 days now and have decided to eat crow and post here in hopes that someone with more experience than I can point me in the right direction- I know this has to be a simple fix that I'm overlooking. <br />
<br />
I have an installer that is working as desired with one change that I would like to make as an exception. I want the program to be added to Window's auto start so that when the machine boots/reboots, the program is running. I was initially thinking that $SMSTARTUP was the solution I'm looking for but that seems not to work on my windows 7 development machine.. is that because the structure/location for start menu apps changed after XP?<br />
<br />
If anyone could please help me understand this or point me in the right direction of the documentation that I need, I would be grateful. Any insight into whatever I'm missing would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You could have tried googling for 'run at startup'...</div></div><hr />
