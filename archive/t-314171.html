<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jairainbow</div><div class="date">26th October 2009, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I create a batch file with the content <br />
echo %processor_architecture% . Then create a nsis script for installing this batch file <br />
EXECWait &quot;$INSTDIR\test.bat&quot; .In windows XP(32 bit) it is displaying correctly the processor as &quot;x86&quot;.<br />
<br />
When use the same exe and install the batch in windows7 (64 bit) there also the nsis exe's batch file is displaying processor as x86. But when I indiuvally ran the bat file it is displaying the processor as AMD64. What may be the wrong? I downloaded UAC plugin, added to the nsis folder and added &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot; also in the script but still same behavior. Please help me to resolve this.<br />
 how to run this batch file silently?<br />
<br />
And in windows 7 while uninstalling the my menu in start menu also not removing .how to handle this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Instead of complaining that your batch file does not work, how about asking what you are really after? I'm guessing you will find what you are really after in x64.nsh<br />
<br />
<br />
(Don't use the UAC plugin without understanding what it is for please)<br />
<br />
And as far as the start menu goes; http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Shortcuts_removal_fails_on_Windows_Vista</div></div><hr />
