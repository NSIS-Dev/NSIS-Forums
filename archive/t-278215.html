I am installing htmlhelp with my installation and would like it to install html help silentley. The switch for this with html help is Q-- I have tried Q-- Q /Q/n and /Q:A as well but cant get any of them to work using the ExecWait '&quot;$EXEDIR\HTMLHELP.exe /Q--&quot;'. Has anyone any idea how htmlhelp can be installed quietly without any user interface dialogs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Many Thanks:eek:</div></div><hr />

Just the path of htmlhelp.exe must be quoted. The way you did it, it thinks /Q-- is part of the path.ExecWait '&quot;$EXEDIR\htmlhelp.exe&quot; /Q--'</div></div><hr />

I have tryed what you suggest but not having much luck with it. So I extracted the contents and found that the html help runs from a setup.exe in side the htmlhelp package. I have tryed to find switches for the setup.exe using /?,/h,/help but no switches are showing, When I check the properties of the setup.exe no clues as to make of exe. The application uses a setup.inf file which launches the defaultinstall nt5 section in a file called htmlhelp.inf. There is a section in here that sets the prompts, I tryed to comment these out (dont know a lot about inf files but found some info on the net that explained some inf stuff) but still couldent get it to run. The only switches that seemed to work some way with setup.exe wre the /s /v /qn running in the cmd window but still not proper success. Dont know what to try next. Have you any ideas what I can try next.<br />
Many Thanks<br />
