I would like to see an NSIS splash to allow Flash 5 .swf files. It could possibly work like an HTML page set to a developer-specified size. I would like to see something like this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">21st October 2001, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry forgot so say, use 'ShowHTMLDialog' in 'MSHTML.DLL'. Dynamically load this (LoadLibrary .. GetProcAddress) so you can check if the user has internet explorer on the system. If this is not the case, you could display the simple bitmap..<br />

<br />
Note this is a quick hack but works okay.. you can do anything you can do in a normal web page (e.g. display flash files.. if IE cannot be loaded or isn't installed or something, it just displays the bmp..<br />

Yeah - s'pose it would :D :D <br />
<br />
Thanks for your post pjw, there will be some really cool uses for that - I'll go 'n chuck together some HTML/JAVASCRIPTery to then show something else in IE if the flash plugin isn't available.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">22nd October 2001, 06:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted actual Flash. It had nothing to do with user interaction, but rather, great animation that would have a loading process and other things. The GIF would have been a great idea, but the NSIS splash never supported anything except for .bmp . <br />
<br />
I forgot to ask ... Does the splash have an Dev-specified size??? I really don't know.<br />

<br />
I'd stay away from glitzy splash screens, personally, since they just distract the user.  If he downloaded your installer, he already knows what your product is (hopefully) and doesn't care about looking at some l33t animations.  If the animation was the point of the installer, I'd just distribute a self-playing EXE instead...<br />
<br />
But then again, it's your installer after all.</div></div><hr />

The flash plugin can be detected either by HTML or quickly by JavaScript.</div></div><hr />

I plan on having Flash on my site, so that takes care of the plug-in prob. second, I was only going to have a short 2 second splash that said &quot;Thanks For Downloading ... On-Demand Audio!!!!!!&quot; With voice and text. It would also be cool to have animation, or I wouldn't have asked. But I see your reason.<br />
