<br />
Actually I am presently working on dummy installer where its takes the database name upon selection and based on that the config will change and the selected db_name will be replaced.It was done with help of senior members of the forum.<br />
Now what i require is i would like to check the versions and make patch fixing also.I started working on that and even tried some examples using the VPatch but it was little bit messey.I request you any one to help me out regarding the version checking from the previous one to the existing one when installing.<br />
<br />
Even explain me how to write an patch file with some examples<br />
<br />
As I am new to NSIS installer and working since last one month<br />
<br />
Thanking You in Advance<br />
<br />

Look at your NSIS help file, appendix E.  (There's also some examples there as well.)</div></div><hr />
