<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zanz</div><div class="date">23rd July 2008, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm new to NSIS (still - it's been a few days now) and I'm coming from Java/C# background. I find it hard to write syntax in NSIS script...the user manual also assumes some user knowledge. I'm not really sure what's the best way to find answers to common things.<br />
<br />
For example, <br />
<br />
If just need to have an if condition with OR combination.<br />
<br />
in C# it's simple:<br />
<br />
if(string 1 || string2 || string3|<br />
{<br />
   do something here<br />
}<br />
else<br />
{<br />
   do something here<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
What's an equivalent for the above snippet in NSIS? The manual doesn't really anything regarding the If-else-OR-AND statements. Please help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See the comments in this file for info:<br />
NSIS\Include\LogicLib.nsh<br />
<br />
There are also some useful pre-processor instructions available (!if, !else and !endif).<br />
See &quot;5.1 Compiler Utility Commands&quot; for more info...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">23rd July 2008, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely look at LogicLib<br />
<br />
It is exactly what you want, and has the syntax you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Personally, I still feel that NSIS should just merge LogicLib into the base of NSIS.<br />
That way we can just use If and And, instead of ${If}, ${And}, and the like.</div></div><hr />

I'd agree on merging LogicLig to at least in the knowledge, it was all the essentials for the beginners.</div></div><hr />
