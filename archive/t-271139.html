<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrDan</div><div class="date">14th May 2007, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having some trouble with the DirRequest field on a custom page in that, the &quot;Browse for folder&quot; dialogue box that appears varies wildly in size on our testers computers.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to set the size, and how do you do it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrDan</div><div class="date">15th May 2007, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I can re-size and re-position my &quot;Browse for Folder&quot; dialogue box and its size is somehow remembered each time I run the installer. The position is always relative to the installer Window, which in some cases can result in part of the dialogue box being outside of the screen area.<br />
<br />
Is this a registry setting somewhere, or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other way is to get the x,y,w,h of the NSIS main window (Modern interface) via windows messages on .oninit store the vaues, then after the browse dialog just opened find the dialog handle then send a message to the dialog and resize to the coordinates of the installer main window.<br />
<br />
If the above does not make sense to you just ignore, because the solution you want will take a LOT of effort if you have never done anything like this before.</div></div><hr />
