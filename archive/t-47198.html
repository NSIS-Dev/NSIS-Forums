<br />
Made build_write_output check for errors on fwrite() <br />
Fixed bug in WriteRegBin <br />
Added IfErrors and ClearErrors, and made other instructions set the error flag. <br />
Added user variables ($0-$9) <br />
Added StrCpy, StrCmp, ReadRegStr, and ReadINIStr. <br />
Added /NOCUSTOM switch for InstType <br />
Cleaned up replace_data/find_data/get_data_offset code a bit (made it find offsets at startup, and update in place - should be more reliable). <br />
Up to 34k now (ick) - will address soon :) <br />
Made compiler extract appropriate icon resource from icon files (yay!) <br />
Made compiler load bmp files for the enabled/disabled bitmaps so that it can resize/decompress if necessary. Files must still be 16 colors, though. Thanks to Ryan Geiss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">15th April 2001, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I was about to upload a new version of my program with v1.2f. Now I'll have to repackage :)<br />
Then again, it says this version is more reliable... OK, I'll repackage.<br />
<br />
Justin, some suggestions for future versions:<br />
- DLL version checking. My VB project shows the api calls, but I bet you know how to do it (and won't have to use other people's code like me).<br />
- Patch technology? It shouldn't have to be very advanced, just that it can recognize a version of a file (CRC), and patch it to a new file by moving large similar blocks around. I made something like this once, but it's in VB (and it's not very advanced - the creator is slow and inefficient, but the patcher itself is very small). It's not really needed, but it could be a nice addon in the future.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work, NSIS rules!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jarsonic</div><div class="date">15th April 2001, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously.  NSIS is now starting to give most commercial installers a run for their money (if it didn't in the first place :D ).  Not to mention the fact that it gets updates every few days that make it better and better.  And it's free.  Can't forget that.<br />
Justin and the other boys over at Nullsoft rock.<br />
:D<br />

<br />
I know I'll be using NSIS for a LONG time.  I'm really glad I found it and more glad that Nullsoft is so F-ING COOL.</div></div><hr />
