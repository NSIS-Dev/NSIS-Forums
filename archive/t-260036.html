<br />
BTW www.molebox.com might be of help for you, just make a stub DLL that comunicates with makensis.<br />
<br />
I'm NOT related to molebox.</div></div><hr />

Would be nice of you to also publish the solution. A patch for the build system would be even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi and thanks for your times.<br />
<br />
The best solution should be creating a DLL including all in one. But in the first time, i will be satisfy if only &quot;Makensis&quot; was in it, with the possibility to set the path of needed files to compile.<br />
<br />
I will try to do it, as Kichik tell me i could :o)</div></div><hr />
