<br />
Does NSIS support RAR files, encrypted and with password protection, from WinRAR? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
If yes: How? :igor:<br />
<br />
If not: Can anybody implement it? :cry:<br />
<br />
Thanks for help,<br />
Rainer</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can't find a plugin that does what you want, you can always use a external unpacker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lodester</div><div class="date">31st January 2010, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just package and call rar.exe from your NSIS installer and do whatever you need to/want. That ships with winrar has a lot more functionality anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CG!</div><div class="date">31st January 2010, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you optionally detect an installed WinRAR installation.<br />
This way an possibly installed WinRAR x64 can be used instead of your shipped UnRAR x86.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm sure that's an answer anders would have given, if it wasn't so easy to intercept the password for those encrypted rars.<br />
<br />
i can't think of any other solution as long as there is no plugin with password support*<br />
<br />
* hint to the developer of the 7-zip plugin</div></div><hr />

I can vouch for that particularity being a problem. :-)<br />
<br />
Anyway, redistributing rar.exe is not allowed under the WinRAR EULA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CG!</div><div class="date">31st January 2010, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why i was refering to use an installed WinRAR/RAR.EXE or shipping the UnRAR.EXE/.DLL.<br />
Dunno about the UnRAR.EXE, but the DLL is free to use and the APi is good documented.</div></div><hr />
