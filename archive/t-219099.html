<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">17th June 2005, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Inspite of the nice Scons solution I still think there is a want/need for information on makefiles. Why: Not all servers can have aditional software installed like python and Scons.<br />
<br />
E.G. if one hase gcc on Solaris we must have the option to make &quot;makensis&quot; on this machine with pre-compiled exeheads.<br />
<br />
Since I do have a posibility to make those precompiled exeheads on a windows machine I can always actulize them myself.<br />
<br />
If I finally succeed in compiling the makensssi.cpp on Solaris after that I will try to make a document / webpage aboout automated NSIS on various *NIX platforms. Since I just ordered a Mac with OSX this will probabbly also included ;)<br />
<br />
Since I'm new to all the Solaris etc. stuff it still can take awhile. Help is really appriciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th June 2005, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">There will be no more makefiles unless they can be automatically genereated by SCons. SCons has very minimal requirements, only Python 1.5.2, which is a very low limit.<br />
<br />
You are still able to use pre-built stubs/exeheads with the new build system:scons SKIPSTUBS=allIt'd be great if you can create a page about compiling on POSIX systems on the Wiki (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">21st June 2005, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I love to makes such a page but not before I get it to work on the Sparc SunOS 5.8 an 10. Then I'll create a page.<br />
<br />
After that I'll continue on my brandnew 12&quot; powerbook to see if I can build a build on OSX<br />
<br />
I could use more SunOS help and tips since it's is all new to me and a LOT of info to read and tings to try.</div></div><hr />
