<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th April 2006, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">For the following half a year or so I will have even less free time than I currently have. I will probably only get a day or two every couple of weeks and I will probably use it to sleep. I will not have too much time to check the forums or the trackers. I hope to still get a couple of bugs fixed or feature requests implemented every now and then and to release a monthly version. Patches will be great help, especially now.<br />
<br />
I wanted to release 2.16 a couple of days ago, but there were CVS problems. I hope to get it released this weekend, but I don't know if I'll have the time. For now, I'd appreciate it, if you could test the nightly build (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip) and the code, if you're not using Windows.<br />
<br />
Afrow UK is taking my place as the forum moderator. Deguix will be maintaining the Wiki, as he has been doing since it was created. Good luck to you both! I'm sure you'll do great.<br />
<br />
Please don't let bug reports fade away in the forum and submit them to the bug tracker (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22049&amp;atid=373085) after confirming them. Same goes for feature requests (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22049&amp;atid=373088) and patches (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22049&amp;atid=373087). Don't forget to login or leave an e-mail address so you can be reached.<br />

Keep making NSIS what is by being a great community,<br />
adios,<br />

Seems like I'll be home every weekend for the next month. I still don't know completely what will come next. But it'll certainly not be a vacation ;)<br />
<br />
IRC has Andres, deguix and Dave as ops. But sadly, the channel (irc://irc.cockos.com/nsis) is pretty much empty most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">we'll keep things running :)<br />
<br />
dave does still not know winapi, anders sux because he hates smiling ppl and deguix, well, is a nice guy too ;)<br />
<br />
there're often ppl needing help in the channel but they mostly leave immediatly after they got what they wanted.<br />
<br />
recently a guy even asked me where to donate for my help, i told him, nsis has such an option :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th October 2006, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Time's up. I'm back. It's over. Finally! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">24th October 2006, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay! Time to drag the NSIS chain and ball again? :)</div></div><hr />

And now the ball is two times bigger. This lazy ass community did nothing, but &quot;bigger ball&quot; for you while you where gone. Buhahaha!</div></div><hr />
