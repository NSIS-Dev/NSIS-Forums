<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HypeTelecon</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 04:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I want to make a custom page that allows the user to select a specific file to copy from a directory on the CD to the installation directory.<br />
<br />
Say there were a bunch of files in D:\extras\, How would I create a custom page that listed each file and placed a checkbox (or radio button) next to each one. Then the user would select the specific file (they can only chose one) and hit next. After hitting next, the file the picked will be copied to the installation directory.<br />
<br />
Could anyone tell me how to do this?</div></div><hr />

You can use InstallOptionsEx (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InstallOptionsEx) to create a custom page that has a DropList control showing the files in a certain directory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HypeTelecon</div><div class="date">2nd August 2006, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen NSIS installers that will enable a scroll bar when there are too many options to display at once. Also, would there be a way to do this with just stock NSIS functions? I would really like to try and avoid 3rd-party plugins. And it looks like the InstallOptionsEx project has been abandoned entirely. I do not want to be dependant upon a plugin that is no longer actively being worked on.</div></div><hr />
