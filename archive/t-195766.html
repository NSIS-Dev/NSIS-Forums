<br />
1) If I run the exe with the /S option, is there any way to still have it show some sort of progress, like the files that are being installed, etc.  Nothing the user would interact with, but somethign to let him know its doing something.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) When I run the silent installer, i.e. foo.exe /S is there a way to run this and keep the command prompt waiting until it the installer completes?  It looks like by default it goes off in a child process and does its work there.  I need it to run in the parent process (if that makes sense).<br />
<br />
Thanks very much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">6th October 2004, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">1) This is called an &quot;unattended&quot; installer i.e. one which shows stuff but doesn't need interaction. Your problem is probably not covered if /S is specifically silent, as silent installs are differentiated from unattended ones exactly because they don't display anything. Try not using /S? Or maybe I should step aside and let someone else talk :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">6th October 2004, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if this is possible with the classic UI but I did a quick test with the modern UI and it worked fine.  Just have a MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES and then set AutoCloseWindow to true.  The installer launched and did it's thing displyaing progress while it went and then went away when it was done. Didn't even have to hit anything to get it started.  For a quick example take the Basic.nsi script in the examples folder and add AutoCloseWindow true and then comment out the first 3 MUI_PAGE_* lines.</div></div><hr />

However i run the uninstaller (including MUI_UNPAGE_CONFIRM and MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES) the last page (MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES) will not be closed. Did I omit something?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">20th October 2004, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW why Run option on the MUI Finish page not works with Silent install? Is this a feature or a bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">20th October 2004, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">A feature. That option only appears when the GUI appears. If it doesn't, that option doesn't appear also. To run a application automatically, use Exec command to do the job.</div></div><hr />
