<br />
But today.. when trying to portabilize MediaFire Express, Mediafire's uploader, im not able to delete this key. I've even implemented PsExec w/ no success.<br />
<br />
i've even tried to manually delete it with RunAsSystem, w/ no success.<br />
<br />
i looked in permissions, and System has full rights for reading/writing.<br />
<br />
anyone know why i get 'access denied' for this key?<br />
and if anyone knows off hand.. what this key is used for.<br />
<br />
through my Googling.. i believe it's related to Windows Update.. but i can't see what that would have to do with Mediafire.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
illegal?<br />
do you even know what MediaFire Express (http://www.mediafire.com/software/express/getting_started.php?agree=yes&amp;key=win32-install) is? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">8th December 2012, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Applications/Setup should only modify HKLM\Software\MyApplication ,  HKLM\Software\Classes\.myfiletype , HKLM\Software\Classes\myprogid , HKLM\Software\Clients\*type*\MyApp and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\...\Uninstall\MyApp (This list is probably not complete but you get my point). If you need to modify other keys you are probably doing something wrong or stupid.<br />
<br />
If you can point us to some official MSDN/TechNet documentation for this key we might be able to help...</div></div><hr />
