<br />
Isn't this a round-about way of doing it ? Why doesn't NSIS start &quot;outputting&quot; the installer EXE in the final place itself.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't this be a spacesaver (and hence time saver) ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th October 2002, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not true. There is only one fopen (build.cpp:1361) and it opens the output file directly, it doesn't create it in the temporary directory and then moves to the output directory.<br />
<br />
FILE *fp = fopen(build_output_filename,&quot;w+b&quot;);</div></div><hr />

-----cut------<br />
Name crap_trial<br />
OutFile setup.exe<br />
SetCompress off<br />
InstallDir &quot;C:\XYZ&quot;<br />
Section -<br />
	SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
	File /r &quot;C:\Program Files\*.*&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
-----cut--------<br />
<br />
...I got an error message which said...<br />
<br />
------cut----------<br />
Internal compiler error #12345: error mmapping datablock to 34257021.<br />
<br />
Note: you may have one or two (large) stale temporary file(s)<br />
left in your temporary directory (Generally this only happens on Windows 9x).<br />
-------- cut ------<br />
<br />
BTW, this error was for NSIS version 1.98.<br />
<br />
I know the error says that this will happen on Win 9x systems. What is the problem ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the data block is saved is a memory mapped file which means it creates a temporary file and maps needed parts to memory. This is done so the data block will be able to grow bigger than your memory. I don't really know what is the problem with Windows 9x, but I guess it has a bug which causes it not to delete those temporary files.<br />
The data block can't be directly written to the output file because the headers size is not yet known and moving the data block around in the file will take a lot of time.<br />
<br />
There is a size limit on the installer which is:<br />
Installers can be as large as 2GB (theoretically -- when building on Win9x the limit seems to be around 500MB, however building on NT then installing on Win9x works with larger sizes)<br />
You probably got that error because you crossed this limit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the installer crashed when it was trying to compress the AVI files(video codec Indeo 5) of Age of Empires. Out of these, the biggest is ~39 MB.<br />
<br />
BTW, would the amount of main memory and VM size matter. The machine where the Win9x error was caused has 64MB RAM running Win98 SE. VM is fixed at 128 MB.<br />
