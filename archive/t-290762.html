<br />
First of all, when it comes to installers, I am a newbie...so keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
Basically I was following a tutorial for making an installer that used &quot;HM NIS Edit&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I started the NSIS Script Wizard.  When it got to the page where I'm supposed to define the Setup languages, there is only a blank box where the language check boxes are supposed to be...<br />
<br />
I try to click &quot;next&quot; and it refuses to continue, telling me I have to specify a language, yet I cannot??!!<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas why the languages box is blank??<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for any assistance,<br />
<br />

A few versions ago, the MUI language files moved to the location of the normal language files. Make sure you're using the latest version of HM NIS Edit that matches to the version of NSIS you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">24th April 2008, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately it appears that the HMNE project has been abandoned by the author.<br />
Since it is open source, perhaps someone who is interested in maintaining (and updating) it can contact the author and perhaps take over the project.<br />
HMNE is a very useful standalone editor for NSIS scripts.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the next EclipseNSIS release will account for the new location of the MUI language nsh files. However, the EclipseNSIS Script Wizard continues to function correctly even when it cannot find the nsh files (it falls back upon the nlf files instead).</div></div><hr />
