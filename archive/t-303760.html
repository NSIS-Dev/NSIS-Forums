<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xbarns</div><div class="date">4th March 2009, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, <br />
<br />
i have a Setup that is supposed to react to features that are extracted out of a license file.<br />
<br />
I will get back a string like &quot;Feature1,Feature2,Feature4,Feature5&quot; for all valid features.<br />
<br />
I disable all(!) Sections and SectionGroups using SectionSetFlags.<br />
<br />
Now i check for the single Features using ${Wordfind} and if a feature exists i (re)enable certain sections.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few sections (roughly 30) and i am looking for an easier way to manage that stuff since i have to enable some sections twice (e.g. once for Feature1 and once for Feature3) <br />
<br />
Has anyone done something like that before and would like to share knowledge? <br />
<br />
I have attached the part of the script that i am talking about.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">4th March 2009, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">could you loop over the sections, grab their text, and compare the text to a featureset variable that is based on the features enabled?<br />
<br />
<br />
Function Test<br />
	StrCpy $0 0<br />
	_loop:<br />
		ClearErrors<br />
		SectionGetText $0 $1<br />
		${If} ${Errors}<br />
		    goto _done<br />
		${Else}<br />
		    MessageBox MB_OK &quot;[$1]&quot;<br />
		${EndIf}<br />
 		IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br />
		goto _loop<br />
	_done:<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
( you might be able to abuse the section flags as well as there's quite a few bits unused )<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, perhaps you could use InstTypes with SectionIn? ( though I think that adds an installation type drop-down above the components which you would subsequently have to hide from the user )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind you, limiting installation features based on a 'license' like this is pretty poor protection unless used in conjunction with other functionality to prevent the user from e.g. simply extracting the files (if only file extraction would be needed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know, but it was (luckily) not my decision to do it that way, sadly i have to implement it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">6th March 2009, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">well, I hope the method above might be of use, then - it would provided fully automated handling of section enabled/disabled states, without having to adjust a separate section of code each time you add/remove a section to the list/etc.</div></div><hr />
