<br />
I apologize if the answer to this question is exceedingly obvious, but I have yet to figure it out.<br />
<br />
I'm working on the installer for my Deus Ex modification. During the install I have the user input the directory in which the game is located (as it's required to run the mod.  The installer then detects if the game is fully patched.  If the game isn't patched the user is informed via an OK CANCEL window that they should either have the installer install the patch for them (OK) or exit and install the patch themselves later (CANCEL).  If the select CANCEL I'd like to abort the entire install.  However, as far as I can tell there's no way to have the installer Abort from a page, it just goes to the next page.  I have it just using Quit right now, but I assume that's probably not idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd have to call a function before the Quit command if you need to do any clean-up.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, set a variable (say, $Aborted) and check for that in each page's Pre function.  If it is set / is true, call Abort in that function so that the page will not be displayed.</div></div><hr />
