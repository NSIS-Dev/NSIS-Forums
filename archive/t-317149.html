<br />
I was a lurker up to now and found most answers in this forum but not this time.<br />
<br />
inetc download doesnÂ´t work for me with one URL.<br />
my code is:<br />
<br />
inetc::get &quot;http://www.foobar2000.org/getcomponent/f804b3d3834e96355a501d92334ec8a1/00efa1b008ad3d8bf9de6790a8cac868/foo_playcount.zip&quot; &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\STAT.zip&quot; /end<br />
Pop $0 ;Get the return value<br />
<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Download status: $0&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The download starts, status is &quot;OK&quot; but the file is only 4kb (normally 82kb) and is corrupt (canÂ´t be extracted).<br />
<br />
Using this URL in Firefox or so works without a problem.<br />
<br />
I had used the built-in NSISdl before and got the error &quot;server does not specify content length&quot;, thatÂ´s why I switched to inetc, and maybe thatÂ´s the problem here, too.<br />
<br />
Hope anybody can help, because here I donÂ´t know what to do more...<br />
<br />
btw. have tried InetLoad also without success.</div></div><hr />

Probably situation is confusing for WinInet.dll<br />
And I could not download file using FF 3.6 - default foobar2000 page appears. And small file content which I could download using Inetc looked like http header, not zip file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so, no chance to solve this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vogliadicane</div><div class="date">19th February 2010, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">found out, what it is. The URL changes every day and mine was from yesterday. If I use the current one it works (at least today ;) )<br />
<br />
so I have to extract the URL from the html first, not nice.<br />
<br />
Thanks for help and sorry for inconveniences.</div></div><hr />
