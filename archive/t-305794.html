<br />
I am very new to nsis scripting.I need some example script on how I can send emails when my application is being installed in a PC.<br />
<br />
Like when the user installs my application with the correct serial key...the installer sends me a nofication to my email that an installer with serial key XXXXX has been installed.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Rikkov</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">28th April 2009, 12:07</div></div><div class="posttext">This isn't possible without the user giving you their e-mail address and you knowing their POP3/SMTP servers. If you do have that information there's probably some command-line executable you can use if you search on Google.<br />
<br />
The other option is to have a PHP script on a web server which you query using the inetc plugin. You can send e-mails via the PHP script.<br />

You should probably post the data to your webserver. Remember that email is not encrypted, with HTTP you at least have the option of using SSL<br />
<br />
edit: Afrow UK is faster on the trigger :D My point about encryption is still valid tho</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can I implement my requirement through PHP scripts?<br />
It would be really great if you guys could point me out to an example that's doing something similar(I hope I am not asking for a lot) :)<br />
<br />
I don't have any experience with PHP.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
SInce I have no  experiance with PHP...Can you please give me a small introduction...How should I implement my requirement...What are the requirements at the installer end and server end?<br />
<br />
A small example with nsis script and its corresponding php script would really help...<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgiusto</div><div class="date">29th April 2009, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Another solution may be to upload via FTP some file with the required information.<br />
Putting online a FTP server (like filezilla) is easy and do not require to write code.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">29th April 2009, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Uploading via FTP is a bit pointless IMO as you need to have the logon username and password in the script as well as the FTP address - all of which could be extracted for malicious purposes. It would be better and more secure to upload using a PHP script via a HTTP POST.<br />
<br />
rikkov, that link I posted has an example PHP script on it! You just need to send it a HTTP POST request via the inetc plugin (read the doc). In PHP, POST fields can be read via the $_POST global hash table - i.e. $_POST['FieldName'] will contain &quot;text&quot; if the PHP script is sent FieldName=Text.<br />

you can configure your ftp server so that a user can only 'put' files and never read or list files from it (a drop box)<br />
It is the same that making an http post<br />
Both can be extracted and used with the only purpose of uploading massive quantity of garbage...<br />
Said so I think the easiest way is the one that is better known (I am able to start an ftp server from scratch in minutes and have no idea how to generate a .php page. :) )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">29th April 2009, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't aware of that but this is a PHP script which can be used for uploading data to a file:<br />
<br />
&lt;?php<br />
<br />
if (isset($_POST['data']))<br />
{<br />
  header('Content-type: text/plain');<br />
<br />
  $fp = fopen($_POST['file'], w);<br />
  if ($fp)<br />
  {<br />
    if (fwrite($fp, $_POST['data']))<br />
      echo 'OK';<br />
<br />
    fclose($fp);<br />
  }<br />
}<br />
<br />
?&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Would simply need to post file=filename.txt&amp;data=text<br />
