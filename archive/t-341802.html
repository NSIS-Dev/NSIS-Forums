<br />
I am trying to incorporate installation of 3rd party installer via nsis script installer. For that I need to extract the &quot;3rdParty.exe&quot; file. I tried using the nsisunz::Unzip dll method but it errors out saying &quot;Error opening ZIP file&quot;. <br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest me how can I extract .exe file?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Self-extracting rars/zips/whatever can be extracted using the proper command line parameters. Inno installers can be unpacked with innounp. NSIS installers can be unpacked using 7z. But what you want is probably to run the installer silently. Find out whether the 3rd party installer supports silent installation.</div></div><hr />

in most times files are not present in destionatzion folders. try sandboxie to get a proper view.<br />
for inno it is possible to rebuild the script. but not for nsis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">6th February 2012, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">You can include the 3rd party installer just like one of your files, and then execute it (that's easier if it has a silent mode):SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
File ThirdPartyInstaller.exe<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\ThirdPartyInstaller.exe&quot; /S'Using PlugInsDir as the folder to extract it means it will be removed when your installer is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prakashjv</div><div class="date">7th February 2012, 06:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I want to extract the 3rd party installer to run it in silent mode. The 3rd party installer is built using Install Shield. For me to access the setup.exe file which is built in install shield I need to extract the file 3rdParty.exe. I was expecting some general extractor which can extract a file if it is extractable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please point me to a resource where I can find the commands which can be used to extract the .exe file. I tried searching net but I could not find useful info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prakashjv</div><div class="date">8th February 2012, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The 3rdParty.exe installer is an self extracting RAR file. I tried using Nsis7z plug-in to extract but it was of no help.<br />
<br />
How I tried was: I just updated the example1.nsi file attached with the plug-in to include my 3rdParty.exe file and ran the exe. What I observed was it is copying the exe to the install dir path but it is not extracting it.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be very helpful.</div></div><hr />
