<br />
In one of my installers I trie to pack one  file out of a directory and on installation extract that file to the same directory on the installation system, but I can't seem to get it right!!?? What imma be doing wrong?<br />
<br />
I use this command:<br />
<br />
file &quot;playlists\${MUI_FILE}.epp&quot; &quot;playlists\${MUI_FILE}.epp&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">11th February 2003, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You could do that like this:<br />
File /oname=&quot;playlists\${MUI_FILE}.epp&quot; &quot;playlists\${MUI_FILE}.epp&quot;<br />
<br />
Or like this:<br />
SetOutPath &quot;playlists&quot;<br />
File &quot;playlists\${MUI_FILE}.epp&quot;<br />
<br />
I *think* that in both cases the playlists directory would be relative to the $INSTDIR directory, i.e. a subdir of the directory you choose to install to. If you wanted the target directory to be fixed you'd have to specify a complete path (e.g. c:\playlists\)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first method I already tried before but it results in errors during compiling. The second method works fine, now I understand why/how to use 'SetOutPath' !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">11th February 2003, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad I could help. Welcome to the forum by the way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">t_vgemert</div><div class="date">11th February 2003, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, been around for a while. I ve been using the NSIS for about 3/4 of a year now. Basically I make installers for our presentation tool we've developped in MM Director, so instead of telling our clients to just copy the contents of the CD to their harddrive we tell them to run the install.exe. C'est tres chic!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">11th February 2003, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Your mention of an installer developed at your company reminded me to say this: (OT kinda)<br />
<br />
If you (or anyone else reading this) has a full installation script you'd care to share I'd be grateful if you'd create a page for it in the NSIS Archive. The script doesn't have to be runnable (because it would require the files in the installer and probably other things too) but gives a good idea of what can be done and how to use NSIS.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if you have a pretty installer, or one that uses a custom UI, pictures would be appreciated, and even better would be comments on how it was done or the code itself would be even better.<br />
<br />
I appreciate that sometimes people can't give out this information because it is owned by the company or they just don't want to. That's fine. This is just a gentle reminder that these kinds of things are helpful and interesting to others. Thankx :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">t_vgemert</div><div class="date">11th February 2003, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW.. I've posted this script to the archives so people can use it as a reference. Hope it helps...</div></div><hr />

Using SetOutPath will autocreate the directory.</div></div><hr />
