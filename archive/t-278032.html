Sorry to be a bit of a newbie, but I'm struggling to do two things with my installer script that I can't find easily in the manual or by searching the forum.<br />
<br />
1. I've got some text in the welcome page:<br />
MUI_TEXT_WELCOME_INFO_TEXT &quot;This wizard will guide you ... visit our website at http:\\www.url.com&quot;<br />
<br />
What I want to do is make a bit of the text a hyperlink. Is there a tag I can place around the hyperlink text to do this?<br />
<br />
2. In my installation I have two files (e.g. config1.ini and config2.ini), I want to ask the user which installation option they want and then install one of these two files (and rename it to be, for example, config.ini). I figured I should reuse teh component page and change the check boxes to radio buttons, but I can't really figure it all out. Is this possible? <br />
<br />
Many thanks :)</div></div><hr />

I'll be cooler instead of components pages you use a custom page with radio buttons, see InstallOptions docs and examples. That way you can know which radio was selected and use the proper instructions such CopyFile, Rename or whatever you need :)</div></div><hr />
