Also is it possible to hide buttons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">27th February 2003, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">To hide buttons you might be able to use SendMessage to send a ShowWindow message to the control to hide it, not sure if that would work or not.<br />
<br />
To control the pages that are visible use the Page command, see the NSIS docs for more information. The page command is a fairly recent addition to NSIS, what version are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jtanner</div><div class="date">27th February 2003, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">i download 2.0b2, and was using NSIS Workbench to make the scripts.  I then manually edited minor changes.  Im new to this so the scripting at the moment is VERY basic cause basically it means nothing to me (yet)!<br />
<br />
Where abouts would i put the page command?<br />
<br />
The only real important thing for me is to NOT allow ppl to change the installdir<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">27th February 2003, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Section 3.6 (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter3.html#3.6) of the docs talks about pages, specifically this paragraph is relevant to you:-If you don't use any Page command the installer pages order will be just as in older version: license (if LicenseText and LicenseData were specified), components (if ComponentText was specified and there is more than one visible section), directory (if DirText was specified), instfiles.<br />
<br />
You can just not use the DirText command, or at the top of your script somewhere (outside of any sections, functions or macros) use the Page command for each page that you *do* want, and just don't use the Page directory command thereby not showing that page.</div></div><hr />
