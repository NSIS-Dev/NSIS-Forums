<br />
Well... I codet several tools, and now I want to add them into one installer. Therefor I am using normal sections with dummys.<br />
<br />
Now my question: Is it possible to create an uninstaller for each of the tool? Because I want the tool collection to keep variable, so you can add and remove tools as you want.<br />
<br />
Would be cool if someone can help me :) <br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">14th February 2008, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">you could simply create a 2nd installer using sections, that works as your uninstaller. you can hide/disable sections of tools that weren't installed in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stb</div><div class="date">15th February 2008, 08:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Suggestion: You could create each installer/uninstaller standalone and then write a wrapper-installer that calls all your real installers. You can install silently so your users will only see the GUI of the outer installer. The outer installer can be without uninstaller.<br />
<br />
This way you can have single installers and create simple packages (wrapper) as you like. <br />
<br />
Using this way you will have one entry for each tool in Windows Control Panel (Software / Uninstall) -- but anything is possible here, too...<br />
<br />
If you want only one uninstall entry there, you should really combine the uninstallers into one (as Yathosho suggested). But you do not need a second NSIS script for this. Your uninstaller could detect what tools are installed and allow uninstalling just those (one section per tool).</div></div><hr />
