<br />
To change the icons (I assume you're using the MUI as you're talking about an icon on the top right corner) define MUI_ICON and MUI_UNICON. See the MUI readme for more information about those two.<br />
<br />
That message you're getting is because you're trying to overwrite a used file. To upgrade system files you should use the UpgradeDLL macro, which can be found in the documentation of NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The file you're trying to overwrite is a system file. To make sure you're not writing an older version it's really recommended to use UpgradeDLL. But if you insist on just writing then just use SetOverwrite try. The default value is on which will show the message box if the file can not be overwritten.</div></div><hr />
