<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swapan Das</div><div class="date">26th June 2006, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">My issue is that I want to check my bundled Exes (more than one exe) versions of my latest Installer with the exes already running at client site. If client's exes are older than I will update the exes otherwise I will quit the Installation program. In case of first time installation, it will simply install the software (which is currently done by my installer).<br />
<br />
Please note that I've tried with &quot;VersionCompare&quot; command and its giving correct ouput, but here I'm storing the latest exe's version no. manually to a variable in my script and then using 'VersionCompare'. I want some automated way by which the installer can automatically detect the version nos. of exes bundled in it, before extracting them physically.</div></div><hr />
