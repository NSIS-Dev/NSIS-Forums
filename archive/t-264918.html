<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saschagottfried</div><div class="date">2nd February 2007, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi to all NSIS people,<br />
<br />
I am quite familiar with NSIS. For a setup that checks a lot of system information, I want to include a PAGE that shows the results of system analysis done on target computer before !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES gets done. This amount of text can be large, so it needs to be &quot;vertically scrollable&quot;. <br />
<br />
The only MUI standard page that uses such a &quot;textbox&quot; is the license page - MUI_PAGE_LICENSE text/rtf_file. But it includes a local license file at compile time.<br />
<br />
First way would be to use this plugin found in NSIS wiki: &quot;External_License_File&quot; - to show a generated license textfile located at target system. <br />
<br />
The second way is to use a MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_SHOW function that uses FindWindow, GetDlgItem, SendMessage to modify text at runtime in the RichEdit control of the license dialog. <br />
<br />
The third way is to write to proper INI section of license dialog (iospecial.ini???) in a MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE function to put the text in the &quot;state&quot; value of text control.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the best solution for my need or does someone has a better idea that looks like a built-in way of doing such things? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

You could also go with a custom page. There's a very nice looking example available (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/images/b/b6/NSISScreenshot7.jpg), although I don't know if the code is available.</div></div><hr />

this is funny. I already use the plugin &quot;HwInfo&quot; from 3DNA people to get system information. But obviously I did not found their way to show the results. But it seems good moderators do...<br />
<br />
Now I decided to use the main idea of the plugin without using the system plugin:<br />
<br />
FindWindow $0 &quot;#32770&quot; &quot;&quot; $HWNDPARENT<br />
GetDlgItem $R0 $0 1000 #rich edit control of license dialog<br />
SendMessage $R0 ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 &quot;STR:my text separated by $\n$\r...&quot;<br />
<br />
And I keep the beautiful visualization you showed me in my mind.<br />
<br />
best regards</div></div><hr />
