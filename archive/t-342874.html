<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BzowK</div><div class="date">4th March 2012, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey All - <br />
<br />
Being in IT for years (mostly system admin), I've wanted to get into some programming for a while.  When I found out that one of my favorite, but simple tools had source code to download, I got it and started to explore.  I found out about NSIS and have been working this morning to make a few changes to see if it works.  <br />
<br />
The source code I'm editing is for YUMI Multiboot   (http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/).  Basically, it lets you select from many predefined bootable ISOs and create an &quot;All in one&quot; bootable USB stick including all of your tools.  Even though it supports many tools as well as adding custom ones, I wanted to add a section for Acronis Backup ISOs.<br />
<br />
I extracted the code and edited the .NSI file.  I examined the code and all additions were made from edited copy/paste of lines.  I did have to create one simple menu txt file, but that's it.<br />
<br />
My Issue<br />
Anyways, I go to compile the NSI script and get the below error:<br />
<br />
File: &quot;memdisk&quot;-&gt;&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\memdisk&quot; [compress] 12369/25244 bytes<br />
File: &quot;chain.c32&quot;-&gt;&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\chain.c32&quot; [compress] 11746/20576 bytes<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
Processed 1 file, writing output:<br />
Adding plug-ins initializing function... Done!<br />
Error: could not resolve label &quot;_LogicLib_Label_1620&quot; in function &quot;Config2Write&quot;<br />
Error - aborting creation process<br />
<br />
<br />
I found the part in the script it stops at somewhat.  Line 3 above is FunctionEnd.  It is the last line of the NSI file.  What's after it, I cannot find in any file from the source code - at least with a text editor...<br />
<br />
Any help on where to look to resolve or what it means would be helpful - Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The script is searching for label with name &quot;_LogicLib_Label_1620&quot; but it does not exist.<br />
<br />
This looks like auto-generated label name - check your function &quot;Config2Write&quot; for some logic operations - like ${If} ${For} whether they are correct.</div></div><hr />
