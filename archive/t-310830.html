<br />
I have a question,<br />
<br />
i have several sections setup in my installer however i have several files that must be copied regardless of which sections the user chooses to install<br />
<br />
at the moment i have the common files in each section which works fine however they are over 100MB and this gets multiplied by 5 as NSIS adds the files seperately for each section, so my question is is their a simple way of doing this without having multiple copies of the same files?<br />
<br />
i was thinking putting it into a function perhaps? and calling that from each section?<br />
<br />
thank you for your help</div></div><hr />
