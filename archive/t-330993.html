<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genjin</div><div class="date">28th May 2011, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm basically trying to do an Installer for additional content to my software, specifically Language Packs. Because of the way my software works I first have to remove old package files of Languages before I can add a new one. Now what I need is for the Installer to &quot;scan&quot; the folder of where the software was installed and find files that start with a specific prefix.<br />
<br />
For example if my User wants to install Spanish language it should work like this:<br />
- Scan the folder for other already existing language packages starting with &quot;lang-&quot; prefix<br />
- May find a file, such as &quot;lang-german.pack&quot;<br />
- (If found such a file, silently remove it)<br />
- Install new file &quot;lang-spanish.pack&quot; to folder<br />
<br />
But how do I do this exactly?<br />
<br />
I apologize if this is a simple question that already has been answered somewhere, but I am unsure what the term is of what I am looking for and am unable to find a solution because of that.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use FindFirst etc, then either use FileRead etc, or use the macros in wordfunc.nsh (Again, see manual: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixE.html )</div></div><hr />

I'm now deleting it with a Wildcard ( Delete &quot;$INSTDIR\lang-*.dcp&quot; ) in my Section and then copy the new package file. My installer checks if if and where my product is installed. It seems to work fine :)<br />
<br />
Thank you again</div></div><hr />
