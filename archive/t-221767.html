<br />
I'm new to the NSIS stuff.  I don't understand a lot of all options and scripts that make NSIS working.  I would like to know if the following could be done with NSIS and if you could just give me some advices and recommendations on where to start... <br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
1. I need to Verify for a folder, and if it exist, The setup will begin and copy a folder to another location (ie.: C:\Folder --&gt; C:\Folder2).  If possible, it would have a progress bar on the Folder copy process because it have about 500 Mb of files to copy.<br />
<br />
2. Files that my package have must be outside of the installer, accessible on the CD-ROM like any other files (not Compressed in any way in the EXE of the installer).<br />
<br />
3. The installer should not display any Licence. Also, the install Path have to be hardcoded in a specific Drive:\Folder.<br />
<br />
4. I need to run some files (VBS or CMD) in the process, I think this part could be done with nsExec, but I don't understand where I need to put the code for that...<br />
<br />
5. I need to ask the user some specific questions about the site where he is (Site Number, Division, City) because the stuff I install will use that in a script.<br />
<br />
6. I want that the setup only display the Question page and do the rest in the background (not displaying Path selection, Licences).<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
I just don't know where to start... :S<br />
<br />
Thank you if you can help me, it would be really appreciate !!</div></div><hr />

1. Try IfFileExists.<br />
<br />
2. See $EXEDIR, CopyFiles and File.<br />
<br />
3. Then don't, see Page.<br />
<br />
4. See ExecShell and ExecWait<br />
<br />
5. You need to use InstallOptions to make custom pages.<br />
<br />
