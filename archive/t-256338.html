<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">albie</div><div class="date">27th September 2006, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Everyone, <br />
<br />
I'm realitively new to NSIS...<br />
And this question somewhat applys to Nsis and <br />
then again it doesn't.  <br />
<br />
I don't have a handle on the issues of porting<br />
an executable from one PC to another yet.  I'm <br />
using Nsis to do the install.<br />
<br />
I'm writing a program using Microsoft Visual C++ Express.<br />
Everytime I try to install the program on a new<br />
PC and try to run it I get an Error.<br />
<br />
The Error message says, <br />
&quot;This application has failed to start because the <br />
application configuration is incorrect.  Reinstalling<br />
the application may fix this problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Can some point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
My guess is that either it's a registration problem<br />
or I'm missing some run-time libraries or I don't know<br />
Microsoft express well enough to compile an executable<br />
that will run on any PC.<br />
<br />
Any help here would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks, Mike</div></div><hr />

I noticed that this occurred with some of my VC++ Express experiments too. Try copying the filename.config.xml file, and if that doesn't work I would suggest checking for the .NET framework, depending on whether you used C/C++ or C# (.NET).<br />

<br />
No, I'm just using the normal Windows XP2.<br />
<br />
And the express compilier is C/C++.<br />
<br />
??<br />
<br />
Thanks, Mike</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been poking around looking for the<br />
&quot;filename.config.xml&quot; file that you mentioned.<br />
Can't find any such animal...<br />
<br />
No xml files at all.<br />
<br />
Where would I find this or a comparable file to try?<br />
<br />
If I don't respond after this reply right away It's <br />
because I'm going to be out of town on business for <br />
the next couple of days.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, Mike</div></div><hr />
