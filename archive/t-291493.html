<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrroyce</div><div class="date">8th May 2008, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, I am trying to create a very simple/standard install/uninstall of the MUI that will place the appropriate files in both the windows users Application Data directory and the Program files directory.  <br />
<br />
I looked through the samples and tutorials and many forum posts but putting all together is more than I can handle at this point.<br />
<br />
Should I place all my source files in a single directory or in the appropriate target sub directory structure?<br />
<br />
How do I specify the 2 different target directories ((1) Application Data for the logged in user and (2) Program Files)?<br />
<br />
Do I have to store anything in the registry?<br />
<br />
I suppose I will eventually have to account for Vista variations also but I will be happy with the basic structure for XP for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">8th May 2008, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Section<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$programfiles\MyAppName&quot;<br />
File /r somepath\*<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$appdata\MyAppName&quot;<br />
File foo*.bar<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
But doing this is not a good idea, and will not work on Vista. If you install something in $programfiles, you are doing a all users install and you should probably not write to $appdata, its better if your application generates this data the first time it is executed for each user (or store it in $programfiles\MyAppName\AppData during install and have your app copy it out of there for each user)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do want to store the application in the logged in users Application Data folder.  Is there a constant that will get their name so I cant put the data into that specific users folder?<br />
<br />
And pardon my ignorance but isn't storing .exe files in the Program Files directory the standard way that installers work?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to check for XP vs. Vista and place the files in the correct locations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrroyce</div><div class="date">8th May 2008, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok..I found the $APPDATA constant and the SetShellVarContext command.  <br />
<br />
Any other comments are appreciated.</div></div><hr />
