<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">13th August 2008, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
This is a howto on calling managed .NET DLLs from NSIS. It works and is very easy.<br />
<br />
Background:<br />
<br />
One thing you should know is, that when you call a .NET DLL from NSIS, your installer will be dependent upon that the .NET framework is installed. The NSIS documentation contains information on how to detect the presence of the framework and how to download and install it if nessecary.<br />
<br />
If you have a C# DLL, it requires that you write a managed .NET C++/CLR wrapper. You do not need to write a C++ Win32 wrapper, which is not so funny when you want to call your managed C# DLL. In your wrapper you will be able to call your C# code directly.<br />
<br />
Setting up your project:<br />
<br />
I assume you already have your C# DLL ready with some classes and methods in it you want to call. If you have this in a solution, you can now add a new project to the solution, select C++ CLR, then select class library. This will generate a managed C++/CLR dll and this is the DLL you will be calling from NSIS. Remember to add your C# project as a reference in your C++/CLR project.<br />
<br />
The C++/CLR code:<br />
<br />
Alright. What you have to do now is to write a C++/CLR funtion for each C# method you want to call. The C++/CLR function should look like this in your cpp or h file:<br />
<br />
<br />
#pragma once // placed at the top of the file<br />
<br />
extern &quot;C&quot; __declspec(dllexport) char* SomeFunction()<br />
{<br />
  // get a string from your C# method (in this case it is a static method)<br />
  System::String ^str = MyNamespace::MyClass::MyMethod();<br />
<br />
  // convert string to char* (this is one line)<br />
  char* chp = (char*)(void*)System::Runtime::InteropServices::Marshal::StringToHGlobalAnsi(str);<br />
<br />
  // return the char* to NSIS<br />
  return chp;<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it :) To call the function from NSIS:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
System::Call 'DLLName::SomeFunction(v) t .r0'<br />
<br />
This will return the string in register $0. You can have parameters too. See the NSIS documentation for more information on System::Call.<br />
<br />
Make sure to include both the C++/CLR dll and the C# dll in your installer and place them in for instance the $PLUGINSDIR. When calling the C++/CLR dll with System::Call, be sure to make a call to SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR first, so NSIS can find the DLLs.<br />
<br />
Hope you can use this.<br />
<br />

Basically it is because the cannot find the C# dll when calling it via the C++ dll. I will work on it and get back when I have the solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">15th August 2008, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Try setting the current directory to $PLUGINSDIR with SetOutPath.

Stu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">15th August 2008, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately none of those three method works, I tried them. It would have been nice. I will explain at the bottom of this post why and some details, but here is a workaround, that will work:<br />
<br />
1) Create your script that calls your C++/CLR DLL which then in turn calls your C# DLL. This is what I described in the first post. But do not copy your C# DLL file in this script. Resulting exe could be for instance setup1.exe<br />
<br />
2) Create another script that includes your C# DLL and setup1.exe. In .onGUIInit it copies them to $TEMP, then executes setup1.exe. When setup1.exe runs and calls the C++/CLR DLLs, which in turn calls the C# DLLs, the .NET framework can find the C# DLLs. When setup1.exe finishes, you delete both the C# DLL and setup1.exe then call abort. You will never see the first installer.<br />
<br />
I guess I should include this in the Wiki page?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Here is why it will not work trying to set the current dir, setting the path or extract the C# dll to $SYSDIR: When the NSIS installer invokes those C++/CLR DLL functions, .NET assumes it should look for the C# DLLs in the same directory as the installer exe.<br />
<br />
Now, we could extract the C# DLL in the same directory as where the installer exe runs, but if it runs from a readonly directory, it extract will fail.<br />
<br />
There are ways to make .NET probe for DLLs in other directories than where the executing exe is located. This MSDN article explains it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/15hyw9x3(VS.71).aspx. The problem in those methods is that we still cannot copy a config file to a readonly directory.<br />
<br />
We could also use reflection to load the C# assembly from any location we want, but then we loose compile-time error catching, and loading the assembly like this is ugly and I had some trouble getting NSIS to release the assembly file once it was loaded - it simply couldn't delete the DLL when exiting the installer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">15th August 2008, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I have work in progress :) This time it is a real NSIS plug-in, that can load a .NET DLL. I guess it will be called CLR.dll or CLRLoader.dll or something. What I have working so far:<br />
<br />
1) It is placed in the plugins dir in NSIS.<br />
2) It is called with (in one line):<br />
<br />
CLRLoader::Invoke &quot;SomeAssembly.dll&quot; &quot;SomeNamespace.SomeClass&quot; &quot;SomeMethod&quot; &quot;param1,param2,param3&quot;<br />
pop $0<br />
<br />
3) It can handle string parameters and string return value at the moment.<br />
<br />
Todo: Dynamic number of parameters.<br />
Todo: Object type return value.<br />
Todo: Fix a bug where that causes the DLL to remain in the tmp directory. NSIS can't delete it.<br />
<br />
I also have it in a version, where you call it with System::Call, and this version does not remain in the tmp directory. This version has to be included manually in the installer and placed in for instance $PLUGINSDIR.<br />
<br />
It is called with (one line):<br />
<br />
System::Call 'CLRLoader::Invoke(t &quot;SomeAssembly.dll&quot;, t &quot;SomeNamespace.SomeClass&quot;, t &quot;SomeMethod&quot;, t &quot;param1,param2,param3&quot;) t .r0'<br />
<br />
<br />
Both versions are attached.<br />
<br />
If you want to try it, remember to rename the desired DLL to CLRLoader.dll. If it is the &quot;native&quot; NSIS version, put it in the pluginsdir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">18th August 2008, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">My new NSIS plug-in is now working. It can call methods in managed .NET DLLs. It supports dynamic number of parameters of types void, string (unicode), int, float, bool. Return value can be these types too. Strings and floats must be enclosed in &quot;&quot;. The .NET classes called must have a default constructor.<br />
<br />
You can find the plug-in attached to this post. This is version 0.1 of the plugin. I will write a wiki plug-in page for it shortly. It is provided here as-is for testing.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think of it, if you have any suggestions, questions or have trouble using it. Also, if you think more types should be supported for input and return values, let me know.<br />
<br />
The following is a sample script that copies a .NET dll to pluginsdir along with this plugin. The .NET method called takes the following parameters: string, int, float and boolean. It then returns a string.<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
File &quot;SomeAssembly.dll&quot; ; some test .NET assembly<br />
File &quot;CLR.dll&quot; ; this plugin<br />
System::Call `CLR::Call(w 'SomeAssembly.dll::SomeNamespace::SomeClass::SomeMethod(&quot;some string value&quot;,12,&quot;15,8&quot;,false)') w .r0`<br />
<br />
This replaces the above method I described and my former wiki (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Calling_Managed_.Net_DLL_From_NSIS), as this plug-in fixes some issues with the method described previously.<br />
<br />
Regards Claes<br />
<br />
P.S.: Minor issue: You have to call it via System::Call. While this works perfectly, I would like it to be a true NSIS plugin. The reason for why it is called via System::Call is that if I make it a real NSIS plugin, the DLL remains in the $PLUGINS dir when the installer closes. If I get to fix that issue, I can make it a real NSIS plugin, that does not need System::Call.</div></div><hr />

I really would like this to be a native NSIS dll, but as stated, the dll will not be deleted by NSIS, when the installer closes. I found out that it is automatically marked by NSIS to be deleted along with the directory, on next reboot, and so the file is gone. My question is, would that be ok? Or should I for now stick to the version where I call it with System::Call? The call would be much cleaner, if I made it a native NSIS plugin, and I probably would devide the parameters up into different parts. And the user would not have to include it manually, just put it in the plugins dir.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually loaded up the code that was in the Zip and played around a bit in VS2005 (I'm an old c programmer). Your code does a good job of cleaning up and it does successfully free the called .NET assembly as it is deleted on installer exit. It seems its the way that the System::Call is releasing the resources associated with the CLRLoader.dll...or at least CLRLoader.dll is not getting/responding to a command to &quot;unload&quot;. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps and thanks for coming up with this one. Looking forward to the eventual fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">3rd September 2008, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Just one question: Is there a specific reason why your &quot;CLR.dll&quot; must be called through the System-Plugin instead of making it a &quot;normal&quot; NSIS plugin? This way the parameters could be passed to the CLR plugin directly, instead of wrapping them into the System plugin parameters. Like this:<br />
<br />
CLR::Call 'SomeAssembly.dll::SomeNamespace::SomeClass::SomeMethod(&quot;some string value&quot;,12,&quot;15.8&quot;,false)'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">4th September 2008, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no reason anymore, and I will soon replace it with a native NSIS plugin.<br />
<br />
One reason why it is not a native NSIS plugin yet is that when I startet this, the dll wouldn't be deleted from the temporary folder. But when I called it through the System::Call, the dll was deleted. However, at some point during development of the dll, even when calling through System::Call  the dll is not deleted. So at this point it is not anymore a valid argument for not making it a native NSIS plugin.<br />
<br />
The more important reason for the delay of the native dll release is that I am not sure if NSIS supports unicode out of the box. I have not yet had any luck passing unicode strings to the native dll. I tried with CHAR and wchar_t in exdll.h, but no luck. Can anyone help me with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">4th September 2008, 00:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think NSIS does support Unicode yet. But there is development going into that direction. However I think the strings passed from NSIS to the System-Plugin are *not* Unicode, so passing the None-Unicode strings directly from NSIS to your CLR-Plugin should be no worse at least...<br />
<br />
BTW: Do you remember to unload the plugin after all work is done in order to allow the plugin DLL to be delete?<br />
<br />
Like this:<br />
<br />
CLR::Call /NOUNLOAD 'SomeAssembly.dll::SomeNamespace::SomeClass::SomeMethod(&quot;some string value&quot;,12,&quot;15.8&quot;,false)'<br />

<br />
The important thing is, that you call your Plugin one time *without* the &quot;/NOUNLOAD&quot; option, before the installer exists. Otherwise the DLL won't be freed and thus cannot be deleted. If you don't have any resources to free inside your DLL, simply implement a dummy &quot;Destroy&quot; method. Sidenote: Calling the plugin with /NOUNLOAD will prevent the DLL from loosing it's &quot;internal&quot; state after every single call. It will also prevent the DLL from being re-initialized at/before very single call...<br />
<br />

<br />
Nope, you cannot. NSIS arguments are simply passed on the NSIS stack and your plugin MUST know how many arguments it has to pop off the stack. I highly recommend you don't let the user call your plugin directly! Provide some macros instead. This makes it much safer and much more easy to use as well!<br />
<br />
!macro _CallCRL dll namespace class method args<br />
  CLR::Call /NOUNLOAD `${dll}::${namespace}::${class}::${method}(${args})`<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
!define CallCRL &quot;!insertmacro _CallCRL&quot;Section<br />
  ${CallCRL} &quot;SomeAssembly.dll&quot; &quot;SomeNamespace&quot; &quot;SomeClass&quot; &quot;SomeMethod&quot; '&quot;some string value&quot;,12,&quot;15.8&quot;,false'<br />

TEST SCENARIO 1:<br />
Downloaded your new v0.3. Copied the CLR.dll to my NSIS\Plugins folder and insured that CLR.dll exists no where else. Compiled and ran the test script and it returned the dll file name again. <br />
<br />
TEST SCENARIO 2:<br />
So, took the code from the zip file, converted the vcproj file to work in VS2005 (changed version to 8.00 and removed the MinFrameworkVersion attribute from the AssemblyReference tags), opened the vcproj in VS2005 and compiled it. Insured the new CLR.dll was in the plugins folder and built and ran the test script...got the right result back from the .NET function called!!! However, the DLL was left behind in $PLUGINSDIR again. <br />
<br />
TEST SCENARIO 3:<br />
So, opened up a virtual machine of mine and installed VS C++ 2008 Express, loaded the unaltered code from the zip file, compiled it. Moved it to NSIS\Plugins, built and ran the test script and got the same result as in Test Scenario 1 above, the dll filename was returned.<br />
<br />
BTW Thanks for working on this one as much as you are. It has some great value. I will use the one I built in Scenario 2 for now, but look forward to any advancements you make.</div></div><hr />

I'm already compiling it for .NET framework 2.0, just using VS2008 to do it. I cannot reproduce the error at all :( I wil continue to try to reproduce the error in various ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbchasetfb</div><div class="date">4th September 2008, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">claesabrandt, I think I fixed the need for passing the number of parameters. In the Call function in your code, replace the num params and params sections with the following code and add the itreplace function above the Call function in the code.<br />
   Here's the code to replace in the Call function:<br />
 <br />
    // params<br />
    popstring(buf);<br />
    string sargs = string(buf);<br />
    vector&lt;string&gt; args;<br />
    string separator = string(&quot;,&quot;);<br />
    std::string::size_type start = 0; <br />
    std::string::size_type end = 0; <br />
    while ((end=sargs.find (separator, start)) != std::string::npos) <br />
    { <br />
        string tmp = sargs.substr(start, end-start);<br />
        itreplace(tmp,&quot;'&quot;,&quot;&quot;);<br />
        args.push_back(tmp); <br />
        start = end+separator.size(); <br />
    } <br />
    string tmp = sargs.substr (start);<br />
    itreplace(tmp,&quot;'&quot;,&quot;&quot;);<br />
    args.push_back(tmp); <br />
 <br />
   Basically, this code performs a split function on the string popped of the stack and adds each split-off element to the args vector, performing a replace of the single quotes along the way.<br />
<br />
   Here's the itreplace function:<br />
<br />
void itreplace(string &amp;source, const string find, string replace) <br />
{ 	<br />
    size_t j;	<br />
    for ( ; (j = source.find( find )) != string::npos ; ) <br />
    {		<br />
        source.replace( j, find.length(), replace );	<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
<br />
Then, in the NSIS project, do the plugin call this way:<br />
<br />
CLR::Call &quot;Somedotnet.dll&quot; &quot;namespace.class&quot; &quot;TestFunction&quot; &quot;Testing String, 35.56, true&quot;<br />
 <br />
OR...the code has the provision to do it this way with single quotes around strings to be visually clean:<br />
<br />
CLR::Call &quot;Somedotnet.dll&quot; &quot;namespace.class&quot; &quot;TestFunction&quot; &quot;'Testing String', 35.56, true&quot;<br />
<br />
You can also leave the spaces out after the commas in the parameter list if you like.<br />
<br />
On the issue of the strange results from my test scenario's I wrote about earlier, I've even tried the tests on other machines and get the same results. My last test runthrough was on a Windows 2003 Server with only .net 2.0 installed. For now, I'll live with the stay-behind dll file and use the VS2005 compiled one with the changes above.<br />
<br />
Thanks again. Let me know if you find any bugs in the above code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had that model ealier too (splitting a parameters string), but what happens if your strings has commas in them? Actually, I still prefer having the parameters as they are now in the plugin, as it is cleaner to read instead of having them all in one string. I do have some code to split that string taking into acount that strings can have commas in them that are not two seperate parameters. But, isn't it okay as it is now?<br />
<br />
What I would like to spend some time on is 1) Getting the DLL to be deleted after install and 2) Investigating the problem you encountered with the return value. Could it be the stack that is corrupted in some way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbchasetfb</div><div class="date">4th September 2008, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, maybe on to something here. That return value being the dll name problem seems to stem from the version of .NET installed. <br />
<br />
My development box, and the two machines I was testing on, both had .NET 2.0 installed as well as the .NET 2.0 Service Pack 1 and .NET 3.0 Service Pack 1. <br />
<br />
When I went to a machine with no .NET 2.0 installed, then installed the base .NET 2.0 redistributable with no Services packs, the dll name showed up as the return value.<br />
<br />
Once I installed just the .NET 2.0 Service pack 1, the problem resolved and I got expected responses from the dll calls. <br />
<br />
BTW - this is all with my VS2005 compiled DLL. I still get the dll name returned with your VS2008 compiled DLL on the new .NET 2.0 w/SP1 machine. <br />
<br />
This may be coming down to some variations of the .NET 2.0 environment based on other .NET Framework installs. If I'm not mistaken, VS2008 requires .NET 3.5 installed. Maybe that has affected the .NET 2.0 assemblies in some way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbchasetfb</div><div class="date">5th September 2008, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">claesabrandt, can you check the file version of you System.dll in the C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727 folder. Mine reads 2.0.50727.1433. It seems that the .1433 build number is the important part, when its .42, my VS2005 build doesn't work (dll calls return the dll filename).<br />
<br />
 I've tried installing .NET 3.5 SP1 on my test machine which installs .NET 2.0 System.dll with a file version of 2.0.50727.3053 and your compiled CLR.dll returns the dll filename as before.</div></div><hr />

Now that you mention this, I have a vmware machine where my plugin sometimes returns a bogus value.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbchasetfb</div><div class="date">5th September 2008, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking it might read something differently entirely on your machine than .1433, .42 or .3053. So it would seem that that is not it. I'm at a loss on this issue as neither of us are able to both compile the same CLR.dll and subsequently recreate the problem.<br />
<br />
At this point, I've changed my prerequisite NSIS code to install NetFx20SP1_x86.exe instead of the usual dotnetfx.exe. This insures .NET 2.0 SP1 is installed. Additionally, I'm using the VS2005 compiled version of the CLR.dll.</div></div><hr />

I will release a new version of the zip file (v0.4). Could you test it for me rbchasetfb, so we can verify that the problem is fixed? If you want to use the 2005 edition of the redist, you can just compile the CLR.dll with VS2005 instead.<br />
<br />

Thanks for sticking with it too. As a thanks, I thought I would post some code that I use in my .NET dll that CLR.dll is calling. It allows the functions in the .NET dll to update the Details list during the install without have to wait to return to the installer and then do a DetailPrint call with some funky string work. The code is in VB.NET, but could easily be converted to C#. The error handling is a little brute force in the MakeLogEntry function, it just ignores the error and returns, potentially writing nothing to the Details list. Non-the-less, very useful I think.<br />

<br />
Btw rbchasetfb, I noticed in your sample that you call CLR::Call without /NOUNLOAD. I found that if you attempt to call CLR:Call again after that, the installer hangs. You must specify the /NOUNLOAD each time. Then when done, call CLR:: Destroy, for instance in .onGUIEnd (without the space but smileys are attacking me). For instance:<br />
<br />
CLR::Call /NOUNLOAD parameters...<br />
CLR:: Destroy<br />

I found a solution to the need for passing the parameter count. When we talked before, I had implemented a parameter parser that didn't take into account commas in string parameters, well, I found the fix for that. Found a string tokenizer code module that allows you to spec the delimiters, constraining quotes that will cause delimiter to be ignored and a couple other cool options. To use this, replace the following code in NSIS_CLR_Loader.cpp:<br />
<br />
	// num params<br />
	popstring(buf);<br />
	int numparams = atoi(buf);<br />
<br />
	// params<br />
	vector&lt;string&gt; args;<br />
	for (int i=0; i&lt;numparams; i++)<br />
	{<br />
		popstring(buf);<br />
		string tmp = string(buf);<br />
		args.push_back(tmp);<br />
	}<br />
 <br />
With the following code:<br />
<br />
    // params<br />
    popstring(buf);<br />
    string sargs = string(buf);<br />
    vector&lt;string&gt; args;<br />
    <br />
    tokenize (sargs,args,&quot;,&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\\\'&quot;,&quot;\\\&quot;);<br />
<br />
Add the following include directive:<br />
<br />
#include &quot;tokenizer.h&quot;<br />
<br />
Then add the code and header files from the attached zip file. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the only catch I found is that when passing file paths, they need to have double backslashes. I'm sure there's a fix in the c++ code somewhere, just haven't found it yet. So I just modified my NSIS macro that calls CLR::Call to do a string replace of single backslashes with double backslashes.<br />
<br />
Here's the CodeProject website that I found this tokenizer at.<br />
<br />
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/stl/tokenizer.aspx<br />

Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">25th September 2008, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice code you found there. However I prefer the current method as it keeps the parameter list cleaner and easier to read. Having them inside a single string is harder to read. <br />
<br />
What do you think? Is it better to have all parameters in one string, or is it better to have them seperated?<br />
<br />
Actually, I could just make an additional function with the tokenizer, so people can choose themselves :) Should I do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might be worth updating the Wiki a bit to make the parameter passing scheme clearer.  Reading through this thread, there have been a few iterations on how to pass parameters so something in the Wiki like:<br />
<br />
CLR::Call /NOUNLOAD MyModule.dll My.Name.Space MyMethod [NumberOfParameters] [Parameter List]<br />
<br />
Where [NumberOfParameters] is the integer number of parameters present<br />
<br />
[Parameter List] is a list of string, float or integer parameters separated by space.  String parameters must be enclosed in quotes.<br />
<br />
Would make things a bit clearer to those new to NSIS and this plugin.</div></div><hr />

I guess you don't have problems with other plugins on those machines? I am thinking of if you could try installing the Visual C++ 2005 redist on those machines. That should not be needed, but maybe you have found a scenario where it is needed. It is the CLR.dll it cannot find, right? Not your crypto dll.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like a problem rbchasetfb encountered back in the beginning of september. Back then we fixed it by making sure the DLL was compiled using Visual Studio 2005 and not 2008, as it seems it fixed it then. But I will have to look further into why NSIS fails to load the DLL in some cases. My first tasks is to reproduce the error myself. I might ask additional questions of you, to reproduce your scenario.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbchasetfb</div><div class="date">31st October 2008, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll add some other successful test environments:<br />
<br />
Win 2003 w/SP1 or SP2 and a minimum of .NET 2.0 SP1<br />
Win XP SP2 with a minimum of .NET 2.0 SP1<br />
<br />
The catch is the SP1 version of .NET 2.0. The CLR plugin on DotNET 2.0 without SP1 will not work on any of these environments. The reason your .NET 2/3/3.5 works is the .NET 3 and 3.5 installers install the .NET 2.0 SP1 patches. claesabrandt, that's why the VS2005 compiled CLR only works on this .NET 2.0 SP1 setup...because you have installed .NET 3 and/3.5.<br />
<br />
To overcome this, I've added a prerequisites custom page to my installers, right after my license page, that checks for and downloads, installs/upgrades .NET 2.0 SP1 before any calls to the CLR plugin. I use the CLR plugin in custom pages after the components selection page. If this sequence doesn't work for you, you can put a .NET check-download-and-install into the .onInit. A recommended .onInit would do some conformance checks anyway, so here's a good order:<br />
<br />
1. Check if installer is already running, if so abort<br />
2. Check for local admin rights, if not, abort<br />
3. Check for and Install IIS (if installing a web site on IIS)<br />
4. Check for and Install .NET 2.0 SP1<br />
<br />
It took me some time to figure this one out - and lots of VirtualMachine undo drive wipes - so I hope this saves you all some time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">6th November 2008, 07:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that we are at the issues. I have encountered an annoying thing and have a workaround for it. If you call a second custom .NET DLL from your first custom .NET DLL, you will run into an issue about the .NET framework cannot find the second DLL, even if you have placed both DLLs in the $PLUGINSDIR. Your second DLL is referenced in your first DLLs Visual Studio project.<br />
<br />
The reason the second DLL cannot be found is that .NET looks for the DLL in the same directory as the calling process, which in this is case is the installer exe. You can make .NET look in a subdirectory of the calling process, but here comes the issue. Your installer will run from some location, and then it unpacks everything into a temp directory. From that directory it loads the first DLL by loading it into memory and then using reflection to scan the methods and properties, so the process does not have to look for the DLL. The second DLL is not loaded this way as it is referenced from the first DLL's project. Here I rely on that the .NET framework can find it, and as it was not unpacked in the installer's directory or subdirectory, I have not found a way to make .NET find it.<br />
<br />
My workaround has been to make a second NSIS script that wraps my installer script and wraps the .NET DLLs needed in my installer script. These are unpacked to the temp directory together and when the second script is executed using Exec, the second installer will be the executing process and thus it can find the DLLs. When the second installer finishes, I delete the files again.<br />
<br />
Although this works, it would be nice to have a &quot;real&quot; solution, where the .NET framework can actually find the second DLL. I have tried all kinds of things, googled for it etc. I have not yet found a solution to make .NET look for a DLL in another directory other than where the calling process is run from or subdirectories of that. If anyone have ideas, let's see if we can find a better solution.<br />
<br />
A note: One should not unpack the DLLs in the same directory as the installer, as the installer might be run from a CD-Rom or other readonly media.<br />
<br />
A second note: One could use reflection, like how the first DLL is loaded, to load the second DLL. But this as two drawbacks: 1) Using reflection, there will be a weak binding between your DLLs and you will not have code completion in your project when trying to call things in the second DLL. 2) You would have to use reflection again if trying to call a third or fourth DLL.<br />

I suspect it could have something to do with the internal variable not keeping the value between the calls. I am not sure how NSIS manages the memory when using NOUNLOAD on the calls.

<br />
The default assembly resolution mechanism should be called first, so assemblies registered in the GAC should still work.  However, if the default assembly resolution fails it will attempt to load the assembly from the directory containing the assembly that was explicitly executed using CallCLR.  I suppose it could be modified without a great deal of effort to accept a Java-like class path of directories to search for dependency assemblies.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for creating this plug in.  We used it to replace a very clunky XML-driven solution that we used to use for performing install tasks from .NET DLLs.<br />

Thanks for sticking with it too. As a thanks, I thought I would post some code that I use in my .NET dll that CLR.dll is calling. It allows the functions in the .NET dll to update the Details list during the install without have to wait to return to the installer and then do a DetailPrint call with some funky string work. The code is in VB.NET, but could easily be converted to C#. The error handling is a little brute force in the MakeLogEntry function, it just ignores the error and returns, potentially writing nothing to the Details list. Non-the-less, very useful I think.<br />

All my calls just stopped working. After a vain search for a similar dll, but supporting unicode, I downloaded the original source and upgraded it. <br />
Now this was my first ever experience with c++, so I'm really not sure if I just didn't screw something up, but it worked in a couple of tests I did. I posted the link to the updated code on the Viki page.<br />
<br />
I moved all the more or less complex functionality to a .net dll now, because all other means of calling dlls (like System::Call) stopped working in the Unicode release of NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have already problems on setting/getting Properties.<br />
<br />
namespace test<br />
{<br />
    public class test <br />
    {<br />
                <br />
        // Properties<br />
        private string _Name = &quot;&quot;;<br />
<br />
        public string Name<br />
        {<br />
            get { return _Name; }           <br />
            set { _Name = value; }<br />
        }<br />
<br />
      <br />
        public string helloworld()<br />
        {<br />
            return &quot;Hello &quot; + Name;<br />
        }<br />
	}<br />
}<br />
<br />
I first call the set_name Property, then the helloworld method. But allways the Propety is empty on the second call.<br />
<br />
It seems that on every call will generated a new object instance of the dll.<br />
<br />
Did you already hav fixed this problem? Or have a solution?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, when i do a simple call it works fine with an exe or the dll as well.<br />
<br />
But when i need to do multiple calls, i think i will have a problem with an exe. (ex. i have to do some database related work and in OLEDB-PLUGIN script files are limited to 60k, so i wrote a .net dll )<br />
<br />
Best regards <br />
<br />
