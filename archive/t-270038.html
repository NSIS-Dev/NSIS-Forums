<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DennisFeiock</div><div class="date">23rd April 2007, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Note: Per nVidia Customer Care, enterprise support is required to obtain deployment information. I managed to figure this out on my own, thus I have not signed their Mutual Non Disclosure Agreement. Should NSIS feel that this should not be posted, then remove it. If not, then here's some information for anyone who wants to find it.<br />
<br />
Needed before beginning:<br />
<br />
 Unzip app that will extract compressed EXEs (7-Zip for example)<br />
  Custom nView profile (Created using nView Properties, saved in c:\windows\nview\[profilename].tvp or c:\documents and settings\all users\application data\nView_Profiles\[profilename].tvp)<br />
<br />
<br />
The Forceware drivers are a typical InstallShield setup. Download the Forceware driver and Extract it (personally, I use 7-Zip). Run the following to record the answer file (located in c:\windows\setup.iss)<br />
setup.exe -r<br />
Replace the setup.iss included with the extracted driver installer with the one you just recorded. The drivers can now be installed (on other systems, since you just got done installing them on the current one) by running the following<br />
setup.exe -s -f1 setup.iss<br />
<br />
After running the install, the nView source files are extracted to C:\Windows\NV########.TMP\. The numbers are random each time. After rebooting, the temp directory will be deleted and the files will be located wherever necessary. This is when I copy my dualview.tvp to c:\windows\nview. Also, you can delete the following registry key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce, value: nwiz; since we are trying to avoid GUI stuff here...<br />
<br />
Reboot the system at this time. You can proceed with the next steps without doing so, but in HKCR the items for the nView stuff will point to the temp directory rather than the permanent directory, and nwiz.exe/nview.dll will not be in %PATH%.<br />
<br />
After logging back in, from command line, execute the following:<br />
<br />
nwiz.exe /installquiet<br />
rundll32.exe nview.dll nViewCmd pon<br />
rundll32.exe nview.dll nViewCmd loadprofile dualview all<br />
<br />
nwiz.exe /installquiet configures some of the nView stuff, /installquiet suppresses all GUI prompts.<br />
rundll32.exe nview.dll nViewCmd pon enables the nView Desktop Manager persistently.<br />
rundll32.exe nview.dll nViewCmd loadprofile dualview all loads the dualview.tvp from c:\windows\nview, the all switch ensures that the full configuration is loaded.<br />
<br />
For other calls to the nview.dll, try opening it with Dependency Walker. Some of calls will give you the options if you pass help to it (eg: runndll32.exe nview.dll nViewCmd help)<br />
<br />
To address the rebooting issue, I created a batch script to run the commands above. I call it using CPAU, to ensure it runs with admin rights. I call the CPAU job using the RunOnce key (HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Runonce).<br />
<br />
I have noticed on my test system that I am unable to find/access the nView properties window after following this method. I am not sure what is really causing it, but at this point I'm happy just having a deployable solution. :up:<br />
