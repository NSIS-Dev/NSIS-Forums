Importing to Firefox is quite a bit more complicated, but completely silent. I'll see if I can dig up the code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is there a method to do it silently in IE<br />
<br />
thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th April 2008, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that I know of. You can see with RegMon where it writes these to the registry and try writing there yourself. But it's not guaranteed to work on every version of Windows.</div></div><hr />

Can you help me in importing the client certificate in Mozilla ??<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

it allows you to install certificates to the IE's Certificate Database silently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But mine is a P12 certificate when i tried to add the certificate to Mozilla by Using the include file given by you... its not working :( <br />
<br />
as it requires a password (p12 Certificate)...<br />
<br />
please suggest ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd May 2008, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">You must convert it to CRT. There are plenty of tools for conversion between format. OpenSSL can do it, if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gave it the path to the .cer file and also the path to the profile (something like this C:\Documents and Settings\kuku\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\bv33xvir.default)<br />
<br />
Is it possible to get any idea why its not installing ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">is99</div><div class="date">5th May 2008, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I was able to make it run, but still I have a problem.<br />
My certificate was installed inside Authorities but when I select this certificate and click edit I see that non of  checkboxes for trust settings were selected.<br />
Can I select them somehow from NSIS ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th May 2008, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure it doesn't work this way? It's a root certificate, so it doesn't need to identify websites itself. But certificates it signs probably inherit its permissions, so I guess you're right.<br />
<br />
CERT_ChangeCertTrust (http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/lib/certdb/stanpcertdb.c#249) needs to be called to add a trusted rule for the certificate. DB handle can be NULL, certificate handle is already present in code and the trust structure seems like a pretty simple structure that can be easily allocated.</div></div><hr />

I will give it a try and if I will be able to make it work I will post the changed code here.<br />
<br />
BTW was you able to find a way to install certificate to all profiles ?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much again.</div></div><hr />
