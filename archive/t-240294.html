<br />
Here is the scenario: the user is presented with an InstallOptions page with a radio button - Option A and Option B. If the user chooses Option A, I want InstallOptionsPageA to be extracted and displayed. Ditto for B.<br />
<br />
Sorry to explain it kinda wierd, but I think that's the best way to put it. I'm using MUI, and I have called the macro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_EXTRACT three times for all three pages in the myGUIInit function. When the first page is displayed, I have a variable INI_PAGE set to &quot;InstallOptionsPageA&quot; in case of option A, ditto for B. In the next page I have MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY_RETURN $INI_PAGE. For some reason, neither of these pages are being displayed. I tested the variable with a MessageBox and it is being set correctly. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Joe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeMcC00L</div><div class="date">8th March 2006, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize for the type-o. It is &quot;InstallOptionsPageA.ini&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th March 2006, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">So attach an example script. It's unclear from your description why this happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeMcC00L</div><div class="date">8th March 2006, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the file. Sorry I can't send you the original... this is for a product the company I work for hasn't released yet. Hopefully there is enough code left for you all to notice what I'm doing wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th March 2006, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Aside from a possible endless loop in case non of the radio buttons are selected, I can't see anything wrong. You should use the LogicLib (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter2.html#2.3.5.1) for logical code structures, it'll be simpler.<br />
<br />
Try reproducing the problem in a new script that'll contain only the problematic code. If you won't find it while trying, attach it here and I'll have a look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeMcC00L</div><div class="date">9th March 2006, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, this is really embarassing. The problem is now fixed. I had the names of the files in my nsi script mixed up. It was supposed to be QuestionsOptionalA.ini, but instead I put OptionalQuestionsA.ini. Sadly this isn't my first dumb mistake, and it probably won't be my last. Thanks for the quick responses. I also started using LogicLib, and the code is a lot easier to read.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Joe</div></div><hr />
