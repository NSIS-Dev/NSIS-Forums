<br />
let's say I've got a folder with savegames that I'm shipping for a game, that I want to install.<br />
<br />
Now the user plays the game and also creates some savegames (into the same folder)<br />
<br />
When uninstalling, I want the uninstaller to remove the savegames what were shipped with the game, but not the ones that the user created. How do I do that?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Nils</div></div><hr />

<br />
\Documents and Settings\{PLAYUSER}\Application Data\{YOURORGINAZATION}\{YOURAPP}\Savegame<br />
<br />
where the {} values are ofcourse variables.<br />
<br />
Then it is also easy to maintain, remove just this folder.<br />
<br />
see documentation about &quot;RMDir&quot; how to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nils Schneider</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">This is exactly the path we're using. An I know RMDir, but the shipped savegames are installed in exactly the folder you mention, and the user is saving his savegames there, too. So is there a way to remove only the files that have been installed by the installer or isn't this possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr Inches</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The only real way I can see to do this is for your installer to record what it installed (including the initial savedgame files).<br />
<br />
This is what is commonly called an 'installer log'. The uninstaller simply removes anything that is in the log. The log might also include registry changes and shortcuts added too.<br />
<br />
This is how most modern installers handle your problem. It is also why sometimes you see 'some items need to removed manually' messages when uninstalling. The uninstaller is basically saying &quot;Hey! There is some data here that I didn't put there. I guess it must be yours, you decide what to do with it, I'll leave it alone!&quot;. <br />
<br />
This does mean that your uninstaller cannot count on being able to remove the data directory it created, unless after removing the information it put there, it is empty.<br />
<br />
These same ideas apply equally to registry information and shortcuts.<br />
