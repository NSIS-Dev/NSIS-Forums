Is it possible to limit the number of installations from the nsis installer, I have seen red wine's guide to limit but it is only limited for one machine, if we copy the installer on other machine it will again run for 3 times, is there any way we can limit the number of installations across machines?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It is probably better to put the DRM in your application and not the installer...</div></div><hr />

To register (unlock / activation) the software you need to communicate with a server that verifies the license key and returns something to make the setup on the particular machine unique. This may be done making a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of the hardware.<br />
<br />
But at all this mechanim needs an server for the activation of your software. I do not know if your software is that valuable. In most cases this is only done in Software that has a high copy potential and / or very expensive software.<br />
<br />
Oh I forgot to mention, there are dark areas of the internet were you can find hacks and crackt, that disable this mechanisms more or less good.</div></div><hr />
