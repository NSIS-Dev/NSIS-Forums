<br />
I'd like transparency for some images that appear in the body of the installer.<br />
<br />
Can I use .PNG or .GIF ?</div></div><hr />

You should do a Google search. If it has not already be done, you're looking at a plug-in or bare minimum a lot of System plug-in usage. Not to mention support may be lacking pre Vista or XP.<br />

In general Windows accept all OLE objects for image which can be .bmp .jpg .gif .png or .ico file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highcoder</div><div class="date">21st April 2011, 07:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but not with alpha transparency. And that is what he (and many others before) want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PNG and GIF support transparency...<br />
Maybe he thinks about transparent form below the images? (by default the form is gray)<br />
That is the different!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highcoder</div><div class="date">21st April 2011, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">PNG, GIF and even BMP supports transparency. But isn´t it that NSIS doesn´t support that? I remember that i´ve tried 32bit bmp´s and PNG´s but that doesn´t work for me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">22nd April 2011, 06:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that win32 doesn't (easily) support it. But are we really talking about alpha-layer type transparency? Or just on/off transparency? Because the latter is possible with BMPs. I think all you have to do is use #FF00FF color (magenta) for every pixel you want transparent. But maybe you need to set some flag as well, I guess google should know.</div></div><hr />
