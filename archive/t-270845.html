<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John P.</div><div class="date">8th May 2007, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">In my installer Section Groups the names are made bold simply by using an exclamation mark in front of the names.<br />
<br />
My problem now is that I want to change the text of the names in a Function - which of course works - but when the name has been changed, it's still in bold. I would like it to be 'not bold' (is there a single word for that?), when it's changed by the Function.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to do that? <br />
<br />
I've tried !insertmacro SetSectionFlag ${MySectionGroup} ${SF_BOLD}, because I thought perhaps that would counteract the previous bold setting(!). I have tried SectionSetText ${MySectionGroup} &quot;&quot; before I change the name, to see if setting the text to none first would remove the bold setting. <br />
<br />
Is there a setting I can use like SF_BOLD, but that works the other way? Or another way of doing it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In case someone else is wondering about this in the future, the solution was:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro ClearSectionFlag ${MySectionGroup} ${SF_BOLD}<br />
<br />
-By the way, thank you Afrow UK for all the help I've gotten from you over the years, both directly by answering my questions and indirectly by answering other people's questions. That goes for the rest of you regulars here as well, btw.<br />
<br />
I'm a little slow at times, so the help is much appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />
