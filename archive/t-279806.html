<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chamakits</div><div class="date">23rd October 2007, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently having trouble executing a program located inside a folder I'm installing as the installer goes.<br />
<br />
The program that the installer is for depends on SQL Server, and the program i'm trying to execute has the sole purpose of attaching the database to SQL Server.<br />
<br />
The thing is, whenever I execute the program outside the installer, as in double clicking on it, it works just fine, and attaches the database without the slightest problem.  However, whenever I try to execute it from within the installer, either its not actually executing, or its not working.<br />
I have tried all of the following:<br />
<br />
  ExecShell &quot;&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\attach.exe&quot;<br />
  nsExec::Exec &quot;$INSTDIR\attach.exe&quot;<br />
  ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\attach.exe&quot;'<br />
  Exec '&quot;$INSTDIR\attach.exe&quot;'<br />
<br />
None have worked so far.  Any recomendations...please?<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chamakits</div><div class="date">23rd October 2007, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Stu.  Thanks for the recommendation, but the path is correct :(  (how much i wished that had been the mistake &gt;.&lt;)<br />
<br />
<br />
And about the correct working directory, the executable i want to execute has to be in the current Directory? (as in the one currently set on SetOutPath)<br />
<br />
Because i'm indicating exactly where the .exe is (its in the root folder of the directory i'm installing to), even then it has to be in the current working directory?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't know that to use ExecShell it needed to be in the Directory set out with SetOutPath.<br />
<br />
When you told me that &quot;...and make sure you have the correct working directory set (use SetOutPath).&quot;  I noticed that no...I wasn't quite doing that.<br />
<br />
Oh man, you have no idea how grateful I am.  Thanks alot!</div></div><hr />
