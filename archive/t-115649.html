In my product i use the acrobat reader. In my installer i have made it possible to select to install the arobat reader software.<br />
<br />
If selected i run<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Adobe&quot;<br />
  SectionIn 2<br />
  SetOutPath $INSTDIR\util<br />
  File ${SOURCE}\bin\commercial\adobe\ar500enu.exe<br />
  ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\util\ar500enu.exe&quot;'<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
The acrobat reader install starts and when finished my own installation continues..<br />
<br />
But what about uninstall.<br />
Should i run the acrobat reader uninstall ?<br />
<br />
In suggestions or idea's to do this a better way</div></div><hr />

I also don't know wheather making your own installer for Acrobat is legal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would not run the Acrobat uninstaller. I mean, in a year's time someone will want to uninstall your software and forget that you're the one who installed Reader. They'll think it awful cheeky for you to uninstall something else.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, they may have uninstalled it themselves, already.<br />
<br />
Either way, AFAIK, it's not a common practice to uninstall 3rd party products that you install.<br />
<br />
If it is, someone let me know quick, before they press the GM I sent over yesterday! :eek:</div></div><hr />

He doesn't. He just Exec's Acrobat's installer from his.  Why wouldn't that be OK?  I'm doing something similar with a 3rd party product, but then, the one I'm installing comes with express permission to redistribute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will run the install as shown.<br />
To uninstall you have to run add/remove programs and the run the acrobat uninstaller.<br />
<br />
I think this is the best way</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree here with joost, you've got to read adobe's license for acrobat reader, i'm quite certain that the redistribution needs adobe's permission. knowing adobe, they are after such things quite a lot. maybe you should consider a free solution. i think ghostview might be it.</div></div><hr />
