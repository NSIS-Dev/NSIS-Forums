<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glenncarr</div><div class="date">4th June 2008, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Attached is a mod for the latest source (2.37+) to add a DetailsLogSet on|off command.  <br />
<br />
We needed this for a couple of reasons:<br />
1. Our support folks needed to see the details of the install, and the output generated by LogSet included too much extra info, unrelated to the stuff they needed to see.<br />
2. We wanted the same output for a silent install.<br />
<br />
I ended up simply mimicking the behavior of LogSet, the only difference being that the resulting log file is $INSTDIR\install_details.log (instead of $INSTDIR\install.log as it is for LogSet).  Since this was for our needs, I also didn't provide for conditional compilations as is currently done for LogSet -- the functionality is there all the time with these mods.<br />
<br />
This doesn't handle *everything* sent to the details listview, it only handles output generated by DetailPrint and the nsExec::ExecToLog plug-in command, which does happen to handle all the output for our installs -- it just might not for yours.<br />
<br />
This implementation certainly has room for improvement, but it works.  One aspect that certainly gives me heartburn is a dependency on the nsExec plug-in source to the exehead source.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
I'm not necessarily suggesting this make it into the official release, I'm just throwing it out there in case anyone else might need this.  I have also built an NSIS installer for these modified binaries if anyone would like to test it.</div></div><hr />
