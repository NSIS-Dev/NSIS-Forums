Yet, when the installer runs, the image is resized, and appears like:<br />

<br />
How can I fix the blurry distorted look?  I used <br />
!define MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP  (path to my bmp file)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's in the readme :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moop</div><div class="date">13th November 2004, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">That doesn't work, and the readme talks about images which are smaller.  I can send you a screenshot of how it appears when I use the syntax you listed, but it's the default image.<br />
<br />
From the readme:<br />
MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP_NOSTRETCH<br />
Do not stretch the installer header bitmap to fit the size of the field. Use this option only if you have an image that does not use the whole space. If you have a full size bitmap that fits exactly, you should not use this option because the size of the field will be different if the user has a custom DPI setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">13th November 2004, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the answer is at the end of the last sentence of the paragraph you quoted from the MUI ReadMe:the size of the field will be different if the user has a custom DPI setting.My display is set to &quot;Normal size (96 dpi)&quot; and when I build a MUI installer using the default UI the installer window is 503 x 386 pixels and the Welcome page image space is 164 x 314 pixels.<br />
<br />
The Welcome page screenshot you supplied is bigger than this (585 x 441 pixels) so the space for image is bigger than 164 x 314 pixels (which is why your image gets stretched).<br />
<br />
Check your DPI setting to see if this is why your image is being stretched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moop</div><div class="date">13th November 2004, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, I am not using the NOSTRETCH option (which is what that Readme is for).<br />

<br />
If you change the DPI setting the image field size changes.the size of the field will be different if the user has a custom DPI settingThe screenshot shows that your installer window is larger than normal, therefore the space for the image is larger than normal so the 164 x 314 image gets stretched to fill the space.</div></div><hr />

This may be out of the realm of NSIS, but I'm not sure... why is my installer showing the wrong size then?<br />
<br />
And Afrow, sorry.  Also, even though, that still didn't work... I get the default blank again.  I'm looking at DPI FAQs and such... I remade my image at 75 dpi... which didn't work.  <br />
<br />
The trouble with this whole resizing issue is that I'm not sure how to determine whether my installer is causing the problem (e.g. have I used some incorrect setting?) or whether my image that I photoshopped is wrong (72 dpi was the original, default setting Photoshop used to make the bitmap, which I then later re-made from scratch at 75 dpi).  I'm looking through the help files, and FAQs, but this seems like it's something that should never go wrong... So if it's an NSIS issue, I'm even more perplexed.  Any advice?  I just have a feeling I shouldn't need to spend two hours looking through old posts to get my bitmap to work, or more information should exist in the readme (I have been reading and re-reading and re-re-reading it all day)... kinda frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">13th November 2004, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">The size also depends on the font. It seems you've changed yours to Comic Sans MS which is probably bigger than the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moop</div><div class="date">13th November 2004, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you kichik, that solved it instantly.<br />
<br />
And thank you pengyou and Afrow, too, for being patient through my misunderstandings.  :) <br />
<br />
Is there somewhere in the documentation that could make the association between bitmap distortion and font selection more apparent?  I can't see how a neophyte like myself could ever have discovered it without the help of a master.</div></div><hr />
