<br />
A couple of days started on with NSIS, so do not beat me for possibly stupid questions, ok? :-)<br />
<br />
There are two Qs:<br />
<br />
1. InstallOptions. Nice DLL except for I can't understand how to make two or more custom windows using this DLL with windows coming one after the other. The one window - it's OK, but I can't catch the event on .onNextPage when the user clicks 'Next' being on this custom window (constructed by InstallOptions). We do have here relatively complex project and need to make some 4-6 custom windows asking for serial code, name, company, etc. <br />
<br />
2. Is there a way to construct custom progress bar? Or the little rectangles with text like 'registering system components', 'starting the driver'. Hope you understand what I mean. Or at least to show custom text while standard progress bar is moving. Just to make the user know what the installation is doing at the moment. <br />
<br />
Oohh..Is that OK to ask for so much from a free system? :-) <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all who reads this stuff and multiple thanks to those who will reply!<br />
<br />
Alex.</div></div><hr />

Please search the forum next time first.<br />
2) DetailPrint should the trick. Just put it in the section and it will print your custom text such as starting the driver.<br />
Please look at the examples and the documentation first next time.<br />
<br />
This forum isn't here for nothing, ask as much as you want :D</div></div><hr />
