<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synox</div><div class="date">19th August 2009, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to include java into my package. <br />
<br />
Source Location: d:\java6<br />
Target on installation: c:\progs\myapp\java6<br />
<br />
The source location is stored in the variable ${JAVA}. The value changes often and is auto-generated when creating the NSIS-script. <br />
<br />
What I got so far: <br />
<br />
Section &quot;Java Binaries&quot; SEC0001<br />
    SetOutPath $INSTDIR\java6<br />
    File /r ${JAVA}\*.*<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
This works. But i would like to have the target directory name intact - so that java5 is installed to d:\java5 and java7 is installed to d:\java7. <br />
<br />
Is there any way to do is in NSIS?  <br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
What also partly worked was: <br />
<br />
Section &quot;Java Binaries&quot; SEC0001<br />
    SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
    File /r ${JAVA}<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
But this scanned the whole D:\ drive for the given folder, which is just too much. I read the 'File' command options. Did I overlook any option? Or is there a command to extract path segments to build a workaround? <br />
<br />
If I had a free wish, I would like a /nopattern option in the File command, so that it would do as beginners may expect. <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for any help.</div></div><hr />
