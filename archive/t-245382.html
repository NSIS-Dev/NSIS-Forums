<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chasetoys</div><div class="date">4th May 2006, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I dynamically create folders and directories within my applciation's program file directory.l.<br />
<br />
I'm using the automatic NSIS script, but as far as I know, it only deletes the directories which exist upon installation.  <br />
<br />
So if I dynamially create files &amp; files &amp; direcotries, how can I can ensure that these files/fodlers are deleted as well?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

The /r switch makes it recursive. However, this is generally a very bad idea as the user may install to the desktop or some other folder, and those files will be deleted as well.<br />
