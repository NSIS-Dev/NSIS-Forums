<br />
i have an installer which copies some files. <br />
the copy-process could take an hour or something like that. <br />
i copy there one big folder which means that while it copies this folder the loading-bar is still at the same position. <br />
<br />
the user thinks that the programm is crahsed. <br />
<br />
to avoid this i want to show a loading-image or a text in the copy dialog which disappears when the copy-process is over. <br />
<br />
i knew there is a way to display a banner. but i dont know how i can show it on the copy dialog.<br />
<br />
thanks for your help. <br />
<br />
best regards,<br />
daniel</div></div><hr />

If you want to have a good progress indication without it you'd need to use /silent and also count how many files are going to be copied before you do it. Then for each file, increment the counter by one. Have a look for non official banner plug-ins which have progress bars.<br />

thats enough for my case.<br />
