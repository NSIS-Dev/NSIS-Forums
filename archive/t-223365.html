<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">4th August 2005, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for a plugin, function, etc. that will give me the ability to manipulate dates/times. The wiki has been so unresponsive lately that I haven't been able to get on to see what's there. :( <br />
<br />
If someone has anything perhaps they could post here if it's not too big.<br />
<br />
Basically what I need to do is:<br />
1.  I need to find out if a text string is considered a time.  (Similar to the 'IsDate' function of VBScript)<br />
2.  I need to be able to send time string (or date/time string) and return just the hour, min, or second portion of that string.  (24-hour format is ultimately what I want, but anything would do.)<br />
<br />
I have no problem modifying exsisting functions, but starting from scratch seems a really daunting task that I'm really hoping to avoid!  If anyone can help, it would be much appreciative. :up:</div></div><hr />
