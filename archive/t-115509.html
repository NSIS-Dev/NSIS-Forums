<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dattuit</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I am working on building an installable thru NSIS... The application is based on Java technology. The install needs to manage the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Checks if the Java Runtime (JVM) is available or not<br />
2. If not, updates the size of the installer on the fly to update the user about the size required for installation.<br />
3. Goes for downloading of the JVM from a central server, and installs it silently.<br />
<br />
I would like to have a way by which I can update the size required in destination drive. I have tried using macro but could not do so... <br />
<br />
Can anyone help me on this.. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />

Example script attached.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have tried with the script you have sent, just generated the java.exe using makensis but still could not get it work... (the autosizing)... then I tried with updating value of SECTION_OFF and set to 0x00000000, and it worked... <br />
<br />
thanks again, It is really appriciated.<br />

Do you still think that it's problematic to use SECTION_OFF defined as 0x00000000?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">In 2.0a7 SECTION_OFF should be the same as in 1.98. It is recommended you upgrade to the latest version from CVS, a lot of bugs have been fixed, and a lot of features haev been added.<br />
<br />
To get the latest veresion from the CVS have a look at the FAQ.<br />
<br />
It's not wise to use 0 as SECTION_OFF because it will override other settings such as the install type in versions before b0 (the CVS version) and some other settings to.</div></div><hr />
