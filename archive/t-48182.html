<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dodgly</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 07:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I correct in understanding that at least one section of the installation is required?  I ask because I'm working on something where the end-user could easily choose to install Option 1 *or* Option 2 *or* Both.  But...at this point Option 1 is required cause it's listed first (Right?).  <br />
<br />
So...I'm wondering if it'd be better that we default to *all* sections being *unrequired* and we just have to specify for those sections that are required (by using the '-' directive in each section).  <br />
<br />
Or...we can add a symbol that means *not required* or something.  I prefer the first option: all unrequired unless overridden.  Because it seems to me that there are scenarios where *neither* option is required, per se, but one of them is required to be able to continue.  <br />
<br />
Therefore...if none of the options is selected the Next button is disabled.<br />
<br />
Am I off my rocker on this thought?  Mmmmm...flame bait.<br />

<br />
I was making an installation with the required files, and checkboxes for desktop shortcuts and a Start menu group. I was thinking that it's be good if the required bit could be hidden, and then have the optional bits and say 'Choose from these optional components' or something.</div></div><hr />
