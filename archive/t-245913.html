I have successfully used NSIS to build an installer on Windows, and it works well. However, we need the building of the installer to be performed on a linux box. <br />
<br />
Has anyone managed to do this ? <br />
If so, could you please post your example back to this thread ? Also any issues ? Other important info ?<br />
<br />
appreciated,<br />
Geoff</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are plenty of people able to do this, some have posted in the forums, please do a search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">12th May 2006, 09:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is possible. I've tested the followin POSIX systems:<br />
FreeBSD 4.11+compiler upgrade, FreeBSD 5,6 Linux in various modern versions e.g. SUSE 9.3. An Win32 installer build on OSX on ProwerPC is still a little troublesome, but will be improved soon.<br />
<br />
Make sure: Grab the latest NSIS nighly build and do NOT use NSIS 2.03 of lower. Best is v2.16 or higher.<br />
<br />
Make also sure you have the CORRECT minimal Scons version on your Linux build machine!<br />
<br />
See screenshot of NSIS build installer for Win32 on SUSE Linux v9.3.</div></div><hr />

I'll make up a patch file for people to download. Perhaps it can be added to the next release (and SVN) as a file that people can apply if needed.</div></div><hr />
