<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vc6</div><div class="date">6th July 2007, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">:winamp: Should the Install section always start by attempting to uninstall the previously installed version?<br />
<br />
:winamp: If so, is ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe&quot; _?=$INSTDIR'the right way to accomplish that? <br />
<br />
:winamp: If not, how would one go about making sure that traces from older versions are really removed from the system? You know, as development evolves, filenames and directory names change...<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Take a look in the included example makensis.nsi, it is a real world installer that you've seen in action several times and it answers everything that you've asked.   Of course :). Why couldn't I think about this before?<br />
<br />
I just found it in C:\Program Files\NSIS\Examples.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Red Wine!<br />
