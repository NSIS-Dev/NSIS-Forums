<br />
I am new to NSIS. It's pretty powerful once you leave the path of script wizards. Amazing what can be done with it.<br />
<br />
I am in the middle of building a complex installer and would like your help.<br />
<br />
After reading the Wiki, examples and manual I was able to solve some problems but when it comes to scripting I just about getting stareted.<br />
<br />
1.) I want to package a python app. During installation I would like to detect a python installation and copy some of my files there. So I have two output paths. $INSTDIR and $PYTHONDIR<br />
<br />
After much fiddling around I managed to detect python (I hope)<br />
<br />
Function GetPythonPath<br />
<br />
  ReadRegStr $R0 HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\Python.exe&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
  StrCpy $PYTHON_PATH $R0<br />
<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
What does not seem to work is this :<br />
<br />
Section !$(Sec1Name) SEC01<br />
  SetOverwrite try<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$PYTHON_PATH\Lib\site-packages\Gnumed&quot;<br />
  File &quot;gnumed\gnumed\client\__init__.py&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$PYTHON_PATH\Lib\site-packages\Gnumed\business&quot;<br />
  File &quot;gnumed\gnumed\client\business\*.py&quot;<br />
  File &quot;gnumed\gnumed\client\business\README&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
I would like to know if it is possible to use the python path I dtected at runtime (oninit) and use it as outpath as outlined above.<br />
<br />
I have attached the complete script in case anyone finds the time to look at it. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />
Sebastian</div></div><hr />

Hi !<br />
<br />
Never mind my question. The code is correct. $PYTHON_PATH value wasn't assigned correctly (filename instead of directory) so NSIS silently failed to install the files.<br />
<br />
I am starting to get somewhere. The examples are really helpful.<br />
<br />
