<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">11th May 2006, 01:43</div></div><div class="posttext">from the MUI docs:<br />
If you want the installer to display a language selection dialog (have a look at the MultiLanguage.nsi example), insert the MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY macro in the .onInit function:<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
oops, wrong function... :tinfoil: <br />
 <br />
Looking at the docs, it appears that it simply reserves the files needed for the language selection dialog.  There's a small blurb about it under section 6 (&quot;Reserve Files&quot;) of the MUI docs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redfish</div><div class="date">11th May 2006, 02:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I was able to figure out what the MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY macro does. The MUI_RESERVEFILE_LANGDLL remained a mystery. MUI docs? I have been using the NSIS user manual thinking it would be explained there.<br />
<br />
I read chapter 6 of MUI docs. It seems that these &quot;RESERVE&quot; macros preload files into memory for faster execution? This explains why it seems not to be a make-or-break option as i noticed in a couple other forum postings. If someone can confirm than this clears things up. I was just curious. Like to know what i am doing (or pretend to)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">11th May 2006, 03:05</div></div><div class="posttext">MUI options are explained in the MUI help file.  There is a link for it on the main NSIS menu included with the installation.  (Or browse for it at ${NSISDIR}\Docs\Modern UI\readme.html<br />
<br />
The reserve function moves the files to the beginning of the installation's data block to allow it to be extracted first which improves load time.  <br />
<br />
The ReserveFile function is explained better in the NSIS help files.</div></div><hr />
