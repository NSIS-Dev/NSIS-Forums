<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stopasking</div><div class="date">2nd March 2009, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">How can I display a few images (as a splash or background) during copying files? I would like to display each pic for (let's say) 5 seconds and after the last image it should start from the beginning.<br />
I tried advsplash plugin which is nice, but it interrupts installation progress and with /BANNER option I don't see any image at all.<br />
With bgimage I can load one pic, then put some files to extract, load another image, extract another group of files and so on... but I want something that will change images independently<br />
I also tried those two animation plugins and they didn't work - I could see only the first frame from gif files.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

Text animation http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Marquee_plug-in<br />
For AnimGif just 'show' at the beginning and 'stop' at the end, but with EBanner you should also select places in script where to set new image.</div></div><hr />
