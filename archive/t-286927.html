However, I have searched the forums and all the relevant help files etc for every keyword I can think of and have still come up empty.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, what I am trying to do is create an installer that I can distribute to our other offices that will install all our custom MS Word templates in the right place. (C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\custom)<br />
<br />
The computers we are distributing to are running Vista Home Premium.<br />
<br />
I have tried every variation I can think of to get it to create the right directory, but I'm just getting nothing.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also, how do I attach more than 1 file to my post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th February 2008, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">$APPDATA is already the roaming directory. $LOCALAPPDATA is the non-roaming directory. But $TEMPLATES will give you direct access to what you need. <br />
<br />
You can attach a ZIP file with multiple files in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaos61</div><div class="date">15th February 2008, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried using $TEMPLATES but that installs them to C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Templates<br />
<br />
That is not the default directory for templates.  These people are completely computer illiterate so getting them to change the default directory is not an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaos61</div><div class="date">15th February 2008, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">and here is the second attempt seeing as it wouldn't let me combine them together</div></div><hr />

If it's not the right place for you, you can skip $TEMPLATES and go with $APPDATA\Microsoft\Templates\Custom.</div></div><hr />

It works!  It was the roaming/non-roaming thing that had me stumped. <br />
