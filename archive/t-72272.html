<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fchateau</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">As a first time user to NSIS I'm having some difficulty understanding how to install an application across several sub-folders and any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
I have to verify that a particular folder exists and copy a file into that folder. So far so good. Then I must create a folder in an existing sub-folder of the original folder and copy several files into it, then register one of the files.<br />
<br />
I cannot depend on the original folder being in the same physical path on different machines, but if it's not where it should be a simple prompt to the user, to select the right folder will suffice.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 06:10</div></div><div class="posttext">This is quite simple ... You can place registry information like the Install Directory or other things like that. What you could also do is create a .INI file that NSIS can read from and then it could place the files you want to install where the user first installed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
