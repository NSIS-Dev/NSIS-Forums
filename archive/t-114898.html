<br />
I've seen on this forum many subjects about upgrading DLL.<br />
Is there a good sample of script to upgrade system DLL such msvcrt40,<br />
mfc42 etc..... ?<br />
I would like my nsis script ask the user to reboot the system as Installshield does.<br />
I've seen a lot of samples, but I can't choose a good one...<br />
Who can help me ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your answers....</div></div><hr />

I wrote a new UpgradeDLL macro which does everything for you.<br />
<br />
The new Modern UI Finish page automatically asks for a reboot, but you can also use IfRebootFlag.</div></div><hr />

Where can I find the NSIS 2 documentation ?<br />
I use the french NSIS 1.96 version.<br />
If I have many DLL to upgrade. Is it possible to upgrade all the DLL and ask the user to reboot only at the end ?<br />
A macro is copied in the source code every times which is called.<br />
Is it possible to do a function to replace it ?<br />
<br />
Sorry the these stupid questions,.... but I'm a Junior member ...:::)))<br />
<br />
....And I try to replace all our Installshield packages with NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NSIS 2 has full multilanguage support, so there is no need to use a customized French version anymore. French language files are also included.</div></div><hr />

Nothing of my script has changed .... and it doesn't compile...<br />
<br />
Why ?</div></div><hr />

How should I know what the problem is? Post the compile errors :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is written as a macro so the File command will add the size of the DLL to the section it's in. If it was a function the size would be added to the function and it wouldn't show on the components page.</div></div><hr />
