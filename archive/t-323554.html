<br />
I am in the situation of taking ownership of software not developed by myself, and make the whole thing buildable through scripts, both on 32 bit and 64 bit platforms.<br />
<br />
Among the files part of the build is a NSIS plugin dll whose an existing 32 bits version works fine (makeNSIS builds the nsi script without problem, and the generated installer works fine).<br />
When I recompile the plugin dll however, makeNSIS complains about the first call to the plugin dll function, saying it is an &quot;Invalid command&quot;. Whereas this is usually due to a wrong plugin directory, this is definitively because of the dll itself in my case, as replacing the dll by the old one make the thing work.<br />
So my question is: what could lead makeNSIS to say &quot;invalid command&quot; when the dll is found? Some compilation options? a DLL format issue?<br />
Checking with previous versions of the sources, I cannot see differences in them. The only differences are that I'm using VC++ 2010 to compile (instead of 2008) and that I'm compiling on a Win7 64 bits platform (but the problem arises both in compiling a Win32 or x64 configuration).<br />
<br />
A last clue : when looking at the exports (using dumpbin) on the existing dll that is accepted, i can see:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Javarome</div><div class="date">29th October 2010, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks that the problem occurs only when running on Windows (7) 64 bits, not on Windows (7) 32 bits.<br />
Any idea? Is it a NSIS bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">29th October 2010, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS just does LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress. If it fails, it either can't load the dll, or find the export. <br />
<br />
You should probably start by fixing the exports, are you using a .def file or __declspec ?<br />
<br />
Maybe post your function declaration so we can have a look...</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all a correction: the problem only occurs when trying to load a DLL/plugin compiled for a 64-bits platform (NSIS doesn't complain packaging the same DLL compiled for 32 bits, even when running makeNSIS on 64 bits).<br />
<br />
The DLL uses __declspec. Here is an example declaration in the .c file:<br />
<br />
void __declspec(dllexport) SHA1(HWND hwndParent, int string_size, <br />
                                 char *variables, stack_t **stacktop,<br />
                                 extra_parameters *extra) {<br />
<br />
which is loaded fine when compiled for 32 bits, when running makeNSIS either or 32 bits or (almost paradoxally as the 32-bits dll won't be able to be loaded) on 64 bits. <br />
<br />
So right now I'm thinking about a simple explanation of the problem : how can 32-bits compiled NSIS could load a 64 bits DLL ? Isn't it normal that it fails to do so (even if the message should be more explicit that &quot;Invalid command&quot;, like &quot;cannot load plugin Xxx because it is 64 bits and you're using a 32 bits NSIS&quot;). <br />
For example a 64 bits java virtual machine cannot load 32 bits dlls using the Java Native Interface. The DLLs have to be 64 bits.  <br />
<br />
Or maybe I'm missing something. If not, my next question is: is there a 64-bits compiled NSIS, and where can I find it?  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Javarome</div><div class="date">2nd November 2010, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">For the record, the problem can be workarounded by compiling all plugins for 32 bits and running NSIS with them on a 64 bits platform.<br />
<br />
So why would I need to run a 64 bits compatible version a NSIS (and associated plugins) then, would you ask? Because I expected that such a version would allow to properly kill a 64-bits running process, which I need to. But it looks my expectation was wrong, as stated in http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=318977</div></div><hr />
