<br />
I would like to have a record of each successful install sent back to a server? is this possible?<br />
(Just so I can track how many people have installed my software )<br />
<br />
Ideally this would happen silently! Or it could happen via a web sevice, like <br />
After successful install, the script calls a web address, a (.php page on a website that will write into a Database  )<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<br />
You might want to ask a lawyer to find out if you should add this to your EULA or some other kind of legal text...<br />
<br />
...and finally, don't be evil, don't send anything that could be used to track to a specific user</div></div><hr />

A lot of users will not be amused by this I'm sure, so it could hurt your brand and credibility. Something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />
