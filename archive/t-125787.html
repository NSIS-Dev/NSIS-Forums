<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PhracturedBlue</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, our installer is pretty much ready to go, but some of my users are getting error messages about not finding MSVCP60.DLL when the extraction should happen.<br />
(on a win2k box):<br />

<br />
This happens right after the download is finished, and the call to extractall is made.<br />
<br />
depends.exe shows that zipdll.dll imports msvc60p.dll<br />
<br />
Is there any way around this?  I can't expect our users to have this library installed, and would rather not ship it with the installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PhracturedBlue</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so I was being an idiot.  Recompiling ZipDLL.dll and changing from MultiTrheaded DLL-&gt;MultiThreaded fixes the problem (at a cost of 82kb to the .dll)<br />
Still It'd be nice if both were included in the .zip, since some people may not be using MSVC for their projects, and lots of people won't have the library on their systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CodeSquid</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I've published a new version which no longer requires msvc60p.dll (however ZipDLL.dll is a little bit larger now)<br />
The new version is - as always - available in the NSIS Archive.</div></div><hr />
