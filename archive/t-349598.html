Don't get me wrong, NSIS is a phenomenal project and it is ALL I use for packaging, but there has not been any activity, at least that I can see, to improve it short of community (script/plugins) improvements.<br />
<br />
Nothing is ever perfected and always has room for new ****** and development, even though NSIS is pretty &amp;%#)$_ good. It needs to grow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Squirre1, 3.0a0 is on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirre1</div><div class="date">13th November 2012, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I look forward to it... I am hoping there is some new functionality, well beyond just adding Unicode support...<br />
<br />
Interested to see what is coming...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">13th November 2012, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">You can configure the manifest with whatever supportedOs guid you want now and there are some minor extensions to the preprocessor. I'm sure there are other things but that is what I remember off the top of my head. <br />
<br />
The build system generates ansi and unicode stubs and plugins at the same time but that is not something that you notice as a end user (It was a major change that just started working last week'ish...)</div></div><hr />
