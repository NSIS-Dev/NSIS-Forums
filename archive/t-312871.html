<br />
I am facing a strange problem:<br />
<br />
My installer (450MB, one file) is equipped with these VIProductVersion and VIAddVersionKey tags and has a custom icon via !define MUI_ICON...<br />
<br />
This works all fine as it should on my dev machine.<br />
<br />
Now, if I copy the installer to one special other pc, which is of importance to me, this &quot;auxiliary exe information&quot;, ie. the icon and the meta-info is lost.<br />
I already tried to delete this iconcache.db file, but this did not lead to any difference.<br />
<br />
On other pcs, the described problem does not occur.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your kind help in advance!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
thegrinch</div></div><hr />

indeed, there is AVG Free installed on that machine and I have disabled the &quot;resident shield&quot; for the directory I am working in. But this did not make any difference.</div></div><hr />
