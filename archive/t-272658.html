Does anyone know about any comparisons of different installation programs?<br />

I already used Google to try and find something but got nothing back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps it'll make more sense if I say that I want to present this to my boss.  Do you think it would be acceptable to say we should use NSIS and then show posts from the NSIS forum as justification?  I do not believe it is acceptable, as I would definitely not accept it without a lot of skepticism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">11th June 2007, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Independent would be your own comparison I guess.<br />
You could get some starting points from the threads provided above and build your own comparison which should be acceptable as well respectable by your boss.<br />
<br />
In other words I'm not telling you nsis is the best, I'm just showing you a couple of comparison points where you may find the inspiration to build your own. :)<br />
<br />
Searching the forum will bring more.<br />
