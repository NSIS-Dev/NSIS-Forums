<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corporate Dog</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">When building a script for NSIS, I was wondering if the following syntax was valid for identifying more than one file which I'd like to add to a distribution...<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Foobar&quot;<br />
SetOutPath &quot;C:\DestDir&quot;<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\MyFile.txt&quot; &quot;C:\SourceDir\YourFile.txt&quot; &quot;C:\SourceDir\HisFile.txt&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
... or if I want to do multiple files, am I limited to using wildcards?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you are limited to wildcards in one statement. If you want to do it like this, you have to use multiple file statements:<br />
<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\MyFile.txt&quot;<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\YourFile.txt&quot;<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\HisFile.txt&quot; <br />
 <br />
With wildcards it could possibly be:<br />
<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\*.txt&quot;<br />
 <br />
But then you'd either have to put them in a seperate folder, or you'll have to make sure these are the only txt files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
according to the NSIS Documentation use:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Foobar&quot;<br />
SetOutPath &quot;C:\DestDir&quot;<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\MyFile.txt&quot;<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\YourFile.txt&quot;<br />
File &quot;C:\SourceDir\HisFile.txt&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corporate Dog</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... alright. In that case, would there be some alternative way to pass in an unknown number of files on the compiler command line? I was originally going with a space delimited string of filenames passed in as a new symbol, but that's clearly not going to work.<br />
<br />
The best I can come up with now, is to limit the number of files that can be identified on the command line (to maybe 10) and then add each of the filenames as new symbols.<br />
<br />

It would seem you want a 'flexible' script which does not have all files it contains set.<br />
<br />
You could try something like:<br />
Section SomeThing<br />
  File MyFile.txt<br />
  !include &quot;filelist.nsh&quot;<br />
  File Anotherfile.txt<br />
SectionEnd<br />
 <br />
<br />
Where the filelist.nsh file contains just a flexible number of files, like:<br />
File SomeFIle.txt<br />
File ANoteratnor.txt<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
[Edit oops]<br />
Instead of doing it on the commandline, you could first write it to the filelist.nsh file perhaps? (could even be done in batch files with echo statements and shift, though it won't win any beauty contests).</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!<br />
