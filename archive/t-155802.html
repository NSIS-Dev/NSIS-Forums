However this Database needs to be accessed by a number of different computers and providing a Database Server is out of the question. So we have put the file on a file server. How can we get the location of the Database file so we can make appropriate registry changes as apart of installing the program.</div></div><hr />

If you want to detect the location of a database, you will at least need to have some information about where you can find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be stored within a mapped network drive. I don't know what the drive letter is. So either I would need a function to search all drives or using a second directory page that you select a DB.<br />
<br />
Either solution would be good. This is actually for a university project and I am a newbie but can manipulate some one elses code for my needs once I know whats happening</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really want to search all drives (then your installation will really take half an hour), you can find file search functions in the archive at http://nsis.sf.net/archive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilllyo</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I will only be searching network drives. They should not be that big.<br />
<br />
I've used to DetectDrive And FindFiles from the archive to search on network drives. DetectDrive only returns one drive at a time. <br />
<br />
I can't seem to find a simple looping mechanism in NSIS which really bugs me.<br />
<br />
But I suppose I'll be able to check if there are no more drives and exit the when the file has been found.</div></div><hr />
