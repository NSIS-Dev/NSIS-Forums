Whenever I download some, a few days later, they are still executable, but when I let a virus scanner (AntiVir, but I heard Norton does as well) run over them, it detects &quot;Win32/Pinfi&quot; and repairs the file. If I now try to execute it, a bug message is coming up that the CRC is wrong. So I can conclude that this virus even changes the CRC, right? It only infects NSIS installers, and only in my download dir. Hope you can improve that someway.</div></div><hr />

If it's a false positive, contact the author of your virus scanner.</div></div><hr />

Got rid of the virus. Just wanted to say that NSIS CRC is corrupted by this virus so that it looks like a normal uninfected file again and then spreads over other NSIS installers. But the fact that only 1.x installers were infected shows that it was improved in 2.0, so the problem will soon have been gone.</div></div><hr />
