<br />
Kichik told me to post my code for Joost to answer my question, its actually no biggie, but my question is that i wrote this code on a win98 pc and compiled it then ran it but i didn't see the new MUI installer running, but the original installer came up instead. Weird.<br />
<br />
Could it be a bug?<br />

!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot;<br />
<br />
Perahps the MUI ReadMe should stress that a language must be defined (or could the MUI just default to &quot;English&quot; if the script does not specify a language)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
my guess is that, inorder for the MUI to show, it may need to compile the codes in windowXP. <br />
the reason i wrote that was that after i uninstalled Netscape 7.01 on my win98, it still leaves a bunch of folders under &quot;C:\program files\netscape&quot;, without the &quot;tab&quot; function available on win98 like XP, its difficult for me to type in ever single dir name, so i used NSIS to get rid of the rest netscape folders.<br />
<br />
if you try to compile my code in win98b, and run it in win98b the old installer will show, the little square box installer, not the new MUI. <br />
it may just be where you compile the code, but since the MUI graphics comes along when i compile the codes. this makes it strange.<br />

Please read the Modern UI Readme and check the examples.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, i will use the basic.nsi from the MUI website and see if the MUI will come up on win98. I am sure its probably something i did. As i said, it was something i did to just remove the netscape directories since it has not been fullly removed by the uninstaller of netscape. <br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">26th June 2003, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of things are wrong in your script:<br />
<br />
1) !define MUI_PAGE_WELCOME should be !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_WELCOME (same for the Finish page)<br />
<br />
2) Missing MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES page<br />
<br />
3) Missing language macro: !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot; (after the Modern UI Settings)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for pointing them out, i will change it. i always used &quot;!define MUI*&quot; instead of &quot;!macro MUI*&quot;<br />
<br />
i usually just copy from the MUI website to get the codes and type in the files and directories that i needed.<br />
<br />
i will try to change it accordingly and play with it more.<br />

<br />
For pages, you have to insert page macro's. Settings like MUI_ABORTWARNING are defines.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you have the latest development version from http://nsis.sf.net</div></div><hr />

<br />
i got my script working the way, i like it. i missed a few things on the last one. if anyone need it here it is. This will just delete the rest of the netscape brower left over files (since their uninstaller didn't removed everything) including directories only if you don't type in all that crap(dirs, not empty dirs) on your win98 systems.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to enable the TAB to scroll through the files and directories just like win XP?<br />
<br />
