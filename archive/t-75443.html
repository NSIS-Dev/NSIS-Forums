&quot;Select the directory in which to install myApp:&quot;<br />
<br />
First, this complies with the &quot;Don't end your sentence with a preposition&quot; rule, and second, it makes the name of the application stand out more, since it's no longer in the middle of the sentence.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the installer ROCKS!<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Who cares.  Change it when you create your installer.<br />

Who cares.<br />
Not everyone is as indifferent as you are -- many people see this as being a flaw in the otherwise-perfect installer.<br />
<br />
I did change it in mine, but everyone else's installer (on major programs, too) will carry this mistake.<br />
<br />
We want NSIS to be as perfect as we can get it, do we not?</div></div><hr />

Why do you flame him for showing you a grammer mistake?<br />
<br />
I don't think you will like an installer you download to be full with grammer and spelling mistakes that will cause you to spend extra time for understanding what does it want from you.<br />
<br />
I think this should be corrected, and if more mistakes are found so should they.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not full of grammar and spelling mistakes.  The sentence is perfectly legal as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Have it your way, but why do you go down on him? He was just trying to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bballer182</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't comming down on him sure he made the suggestion and then he got repies likew he wanted. But what i'm saying is none of the guys that have been around NSIS for a long time don't really care and maybe they like it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be that no one noticed... I for one think he's right, and it DOES sound better his way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tresni</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree.  Not only does it look more proffesional, it sounds better.  The current sentance, though readable, is gramatically incorrect.  To make NSIS the best out there, we have to fix those things that are as small and as weird as a single gramatical error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bballer182</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe drop the &quot;in&quot;:  But don't change the whole thing. Just sounds too English that way. And your write Cluter it is insignificant!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cluster</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is insignificant. I have no claims otherwise.<br />
<br />
Dropping just the &quot;in&quot; makes it sound like you have to select a directory in order to get the program installed... that doesn't make much sense... the idea is for user to select a directory IN WHICH they want the program to be installed.<br />
<br />
However, all this arguing is pointless. I don't think that anyone here doubts that my version is correct English, so why not just fix it instead of arguing about it for days now?</div></div><hr />
