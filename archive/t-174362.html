<br />
I recommend you not to rely on external applications to copy files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">atsuk</div><div class="date">28th March 2004, 06:34</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, that's what i would also do, if i would only konw how to copy whole directory including every unknown subdirectory in parent directory to somewhere else. It would be great, if i could exclude some defined filetypes, or even better include only defined filetypes.<br />
 CopyFiles /SILENT '$From\*.doc' '$To' ;&lt;- not good enough<br />
if you know something for it, let me know, if not, maybe someone can still give me some information about xcopy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">atsuk</div><div class="date">28th March 2004, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">@Yathosho<br />
i wanted to try xcopy(i have heard about it, but never seen it in script or manual), but only problem is that i don't know where could i get xcopy syntax, manual or what ever, that could help me to understand how to cope with it. <br />
Yathosho, maybe you can give me some tips?(or who ever, any help would be welcome)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">28th March 2004, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, he ment, that you should call xcopy in the console with the parameter '/?'.<br />
usually the programm now gives out it's syntax.<br />
but why don't you just launch the programm without any parameters?<br />
or search in the internet for &quot;xcopy syntax&quot; or something like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">atsuk</div><div class="date">28th March 2004, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">dooh, forgive me beeing so dumb:D i didn't realise that you ment typing this into command line.<br />
ok big tnx</div></div><hr />
