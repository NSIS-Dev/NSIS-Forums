<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KHolmes</div><div class="date">5th May 2003, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
 <br />
I know there is code out there for a username and password.. I have found a few on this board.  <br />
Is this possible. I have 3 different programs I want installed. User1 enters username1 password1 can then proceed to install program1, user2 enters username2 and password2 can install program2, user3 enters username3 and password3 can then proceed to install program3. I could make 3 different installers and 3 different discs, but that's not what I really want.  If someoen could modify the code below and repost it. That would be greatly appreciated by myself and anyone else who can use it  <br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">5th May 2003, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">You can save a value to a variable and use it to install different files in the section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KHolmes</div><div class="date">6th May 2003, 01:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Joost could you modify your code so it would do this? I am not that well versed in nsi scripts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please and Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">6th May 2003, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Just what you did in the page function, you can also put that in a section (read the INI file again or store the values in a variable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KHolmes</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Joost I am really new to programming and scripting.. I could really use your help on howto figure out how to get these into a variable and how each can call their own files to install... I am hoping to study and learn off what you have done, but I just don't have the knowledge to continue from here..<br />
<br />
Can you please help me...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Check 'Examples\Modern UI\InstallOptions.nsi' or 'Contrib\InstallOptions\test.nsi', they use the input of a custom page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a way of doing it, but I'd prefer being able to do it by turning sections on and off (yet still have them invisible) rather than testing a variable in each section. Still, it seems to work okay.<br />
<br />
(Note: it's a variation on the script KiCHiK linked to at the top of this page, so it needs the .ini file that goes with that script, follow his link to find the ini file)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunjammer, in the latest CVS version (maybe even b3, I don't remember right now) you can unselect hidden sections so they won't get executed. I have attached a small example script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I've just never played with that stuff, and figured any kind of solution would be of interest to KHolmes. I was actually going to hold back but then thought &quot;hmm he/she's been waiting for a while already&quot; ... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KHolmes</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 02:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I can get it to run, but it let's user2 install user1's file etc... I don't want user2 to be able to choose user1's file just their own file.<br />
This is what I have.. Is what I am asking possible?<br />
<br />
Section &quot;user1&quot; user1<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;user1 section&quot;<br />
  StrCmp  $R9 &quot;user1&quot; 0<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;install files&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
  File /r &quot;file1.exe&quot;<br />
  CreateShortCut &quot;$DESKTOP\$File.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\$File.*&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
  skip:<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;user2&quot; user2<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;user2 section&quot;<br />
  StrCmp $R9 &quot;user2&quot; 0 skip<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;install files&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
  File /r &quot;user2.exe&quot;<br />
  CreateShortCut &quot;$DESKTOP\$File.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\$File.*&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />

Anyone got any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand, it works fine for me. If I &quot;login&quot; as user2 then the only files it installs are the files in the section for user2. The DetailPrint output shows on my screen :-User name: user2<br />
Password: user2 password<br />
user1 section<br />
user2 section<br />
install files<br />
Extract: NSIS.exe<br />
user3 section<br />
Completed<br />
Now obviously I just set some arbitrary files to install but nsis.exe was the file for user2, it didn't install any of the files I had in the other sections so what is it that doesn't work for you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Put back the minuses before the section name. If the name is &quot;-user1&quot; the section won't show as a component on the components page and the user won't be able to deselect it, although it will still not install because of the check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahha I didn't spot that, nice one KiCHiK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KHolmes</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I got it to work...<br />
Thanks for all your guys' help.. I really appreciate it..<br />
<br />
Here is the modified version for anyone who is new to NSI. I added a few more comments for the ultra newb like myself..<br />
<br />
The up.ini file can be found at the link that Kichik added above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KHolmes</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use this script post a reply here. It's always nice to give a kudos to the people who wrote it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KHolmes</div><div class="date">11th May 2003, 02:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick question. How do you get rid of the prompt that comes up that gives you the username and password?<br />
<br />
Never mind.. I opened my eyes and saw this <br />
MessageBox MB_OK &quot;user [$0] pass [$1]&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">11th May 2003, 03:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I think because is:<br />
<br />
MessageBox MB_OK &quot;user $0 pass $1&quot;<br />
; change this line in your script</div></div><hr />
