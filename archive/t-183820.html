<br />
I have a quick question. I have just started working with NSIS and I was wondering if someone would be willing to answer my question. I seared the forums and whatnot, and could not find exactly what I was looking for.  <br />
<br />
What I wish to do with NSIS is build an installer that will download the 2 zip files, extract them, then run their respective executables.<br />
<br />
Also, on top of that during their exectuables, I would like(if possible) to have NSIS automatically interact with the windows by pressing next and filling in some fields.  <br />
<br />
Is this at all possible?<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any code snippets, links that would help, etc ,etc. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You can also try to find out whether these installers have a silent mode.</div></div><hr />
