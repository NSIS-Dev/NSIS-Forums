<br />
I don't really want to do this at all, but it's something that higher ups are forcing me to figure out.  I know that there are other forum topics on this, but they dead end.<br />
<br />
Has anyone made any kind of development regarding an animated image crammed anywhere inside the installer?  Preferably gif format, but I'm desperate now and will settle for any image animation.  I've tried to appease them with lots and lots of moving updating text, but it's not enough.  They need an image.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of somehow either using sendmessage to change the image over and over to a different one, but have no idea if that would even work.  Has anyone tried it?<br />
<br />
ANY information would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

<br />
I've only tinkered with it a few minutes a while ago, but the description says GIF is supported, so you should be able to put an animated GIF on your UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">11th February 2006, 06:42</div></div><div class="posttext">EmbeddedBanner shows not animated gifs, you can change images from script only :( Animate control of InstallOptionsEx implements Windows Animation, but it not supports animated gif as well and require custom page (aren't it?). I remember attempts of animation control dynamic adding to INSTFILES page, but I cannot find it right now.</div></div><hr />

I spent 2 hours with it and first draft attached. Transparency, image location and stretching are still in 'todo' list, but dll looks stable in simple cases.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">13th February 2006, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way is to update  nsWeb plug-in (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=211040&amp;highlight=browser+control) (or some other code) for dynamic browser control creation on the installer windows (not on custom pages only), this worked with GIFs on INSTFILES in my tests (but I could not close MUI page without Tasks manager) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">14th February 2006, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Browser control is good, but I like these 'hand made' things (17-th century :) ). Animated GIF with transparency and (optional) target window handle worked in my tests with attached plug-in. Image transparency color index value was just replaced with the color of the left top corner of the paint rectangle on the target window. Included Felix image is big (74 kB), but it is good for test. Later I'll fix bugs (if any) and create wiki page. Few MSVCRT dependencies still presents because of new/delete operators.</div></div><hr />

Fixed bug - dialog field color extraction in the custom 'show' function. <br />
Playing on the other windows (not pages) is a question of window handle getting, for example, might be good to test it with BGGradient window. But transparency support on not-page windows may be not correct.</div></div><hr />

New /FIT option, may be usefull for various screens dpi's, stretches image to fit window width or height (for example, left logo on Welcome page).

<br />
I have recently posted a message pertaining to loading an animated GIF Image for NSIS.<br />
<br />
The E-mail link is as shown below;<br />
<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=245291<br />
<br />
Based on the content of the link, could you advice me on any possible solutions? I have also posted the scripts regarding the problem I am having in the link provided above.<br />
<br />
I am using your AnimGif plugin along with the newadvsplash.dll plugin to run this implementation.<br />
<br />
Would truly appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks man.</div></div><hr />
