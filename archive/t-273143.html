You don't have to worry about whether these files are in use as they will be updated on reboot if they are in use.<br />
<br />
For your own files, you can use the FindProcDLL plug-in to check one at a time if any of your executables are in use and display a message if they are:<br />
<br />
Function CheckRunning<br />
check_running:<br />
	FindProcDll::FindProc &quot;MyProgram.exe&quot;<br />
	${If} $R0 == 1<br />
		MessageBox MB_OKCANCEL|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION &quot;Setup has detected a running instance of \<br />
		MyProgram. Please close MyProgram and click OK to continue.&quot; IDOK +2<br />
		Abort<br />
		Goto check_running<br />
	${EndIf}<br />
FunctionEnd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisywheel</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 08:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using InstallLib macro for instalation of my dll files but I would like to avoid rebooting. My software doesn't need it. <br />
I run InstallLib macro with  NOTSHARED NOREBOOT_PROTECTED flags and when dll is used by another process message box appears saying some dll is busy. This is enough informaiton for me as for developer but I afraid common user won't understand it. I prefer to show message box like<br />
&quot;Internet Explorer is using some components. Close this application to continue installation&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know for sure if IE the only application which could use my dll files so it's not so easy to use <br />
FindProcDll::FindProc function<br />
<br />
Any ideas how can I help end-user to understand what application is blocking installation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it will be really user friendly. InstallShield can do it so I hope NSIS can do it too.<br />
<br />
Doesn't anybody has written such plugin yet?</div></div><hr />
