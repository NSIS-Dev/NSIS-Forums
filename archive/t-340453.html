<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bramoin</div><div class="date">12th January 2012, 06:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am trying to download the NSIS plugin by clicking on the links provided here http://eclipsensis.sourceforge.net/index.shtml in the download section, it comes back with error message or it takes too long: <br />
<br />
<br />
Download<br />
There are two ways to download EclipseNSIS plugins:<br />
<br />
(Recommended) Use the Eclipse Software Updates and Add-ons utility or the classic Eclipse Update Manager to connect to http://eclipsensis.sf.net/update and download the desired release.<br />
Download directly from SourceForge and unzip into the Eclipse folder. However, using this method will NOT ensure that all prerequisites for using the plugins have been satisfied.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am talking about the first and second link in the (Recommended) line. I can however go to the last link and pull down the jar files. Except that i don't know where to put the content of the jar files. And how to make eclipse consider this as a plugin.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7. I did not find the documentation on the page on how to install a plugin into eclipse.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />
Thank you,<br />
bramoin</div></div><hr />

I found the answer to this question i had and since i had to dig for it and finally asked my colleage for it. Here is the answer for anyone who will run into this:<br />
<br />
<br />
 If you already have an nsi script loaded into the Eclipse editor before you load the plug in you may have to exit and restart, I know I did but I don't recall exactly why I needed to.<br />
 Use the Help -&gt; Install New Software menu to open the dialog.<br />
 Click the &quot;Add&quot; button<br />
 For description type &quot;EclipseNSIS&quot;<br />
 For address type &quot;http://eclipsensis.sf.net/update&quot;<br />
 Click OK, the archive will be queried and you should see a list of components.<br />
 Click &quot;Select All&quot; and install them.</div></div><hr />
