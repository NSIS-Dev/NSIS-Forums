<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinar</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I searched but didn't come up with anything.  Perhaps I'm just not searching for the right things cause this seems like it would be a common question...<br />
<br />
I would like to make sure none of the files in my install are in use before deleting anything.<br />
<br />
Currently, my problem is that the uninstaller runs through as though nothing is wrong and just doesn't remove whatever is currently in use.  This of course causes incomplete uninstalls.<br />
<br />
Any Suggestions?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried this but it should fail if anything in it is locked...<br />

I then do what Afrow UK suggested on some other miscellaneous files that QA complained about.  All else I use the /REBOOTOK flag when removing.  Then from the installer, I check the install directory against any strings located in the remove-on-reboot registry key located at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager, key is PendingFileRenameOperations, and remove them from here so that on reboot they won't be deleted if the end-user re-installs the application without a reboot.</div></div><hr />
