<br />
I'm sorry to disturb, as asked by kichik in the ReadMe First section I read the documentation, I looked at appendix C: Useful Scripts, I searched the NSIS Wiki, I read the FAQ and I searched the forum but I couldn't find the answer to my question.<br />
<br />
My purpose is to add invalid folders in the directory page (in order for the next button to be invalid when such paths are selected by the user). I tried several things, as using GetDlgItem and EnableWindow to search for and invalid the Next Button in the .onVerifyInstDir function, but that didn't work (I managed to invalid all buttons except this one :) I suppose that it is reset to another state after this function call), or setting the DirVerify to leave and work in the leave page callback, but by design this doesn't invalid the button.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution to my problem ? Can I add directly some paths in the paths checked by NSIS ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot by advance for your help,<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Robin.</div></div><hr />
