<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jsbach</div><div class="date">1st July 2005, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">i've a routine that shows a banner (modified dialog 111 in modern.exe UI) as usual (banner:show...).<br />
The dialog is shown if i run the script manually but it doesn't if the script is run as scheduled task.<br />
The banner is called insided .OnInit: is this the problem ?<br />
I remember i saw some similar post: not sure; anycase i've urgent need to fix this so i have to post the issue in advance.<br />
appreciates any help. thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jsbach</div><div class="date">1st July 2005, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">interesting: only now i realize there's no way at first sight to set interactive flag in w2k as it was in the past in WNT. looking for how-to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jsbach</div><div class="date">1st July 2005, 23:40</div></div><div class="posttext">it seems on w2k the /interactive flag can't be set anywhere if using the gui interface. it is possible to use the AT command but it's old and anyway you can't set with it some parameters like duration and frequency.<br />
uhm... this can be done with jt.exe that comes with resource kit but i would prefer not.<br />
maybe it's time to review brainsucker's sample : it's quite old and incomplete as it doesn't check existence of task and you get error if trying to recreate the same but it's a perfect starting point.<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />
