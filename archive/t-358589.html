<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bansaw</div><div class="date">1st April 2013, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">One part of my installer invokes a 3rd party installer using Execwait.<br />
Its been working fine in XP and Vista.<br />
<br />
For some reason, on Windows 7, the 3rd party installer simply refuses to invoke.<br />
<br />
If I exit my installer and double-click on the same 3rd party installer in Windows Explorer, it invokes fine.   <br />
As I say, the installer invokes fine from XP so the spelling etc is right.<br />
<br />
Why isn't it invoking from NSIS on Win7?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have &quot;requestexecutionlevel admin&quot; in your script?<br />
Is UAC on under Vista AND 7? Are they both 32 bit?<br />
<br />
Try Process Monitor and see why the process dies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bansaw</div><div class="date">1st April 2013, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks,   I changed the execution level from &quot;user&quot; to:<br />
RequestExecutionLevel highest<br />
and this seemed to fix it.    Now the 3rd party installer invokes fine.<br />
<br />
I just hope and assume that this execution level change doesn't affect other things.  I'll give it a test on a few other 7,XP, Vista machines and see how it performs on those platforms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">1st April 2013, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You should take a look at the manifest for this other installer (Resource Hacker or hex editor) and match its executionlevel. Highest is probably not enough, usually you want user or admin.</div></div><hr />
