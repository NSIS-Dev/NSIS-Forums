<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">1st April 2006, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Every time I work with NSIS, I search the forums regularly. There are a couple of small changes to http://forums.winamp.com/search.php that could speed up searching a little bit, which would be a big change for those of us who search a lot.<br />
<br />
I doubt that anybody here is a forum admin, but maybe if a lot of people and/or a mod agrees, a request could be submitted to an admin by a mod.<br />
<br />
Here are the suggested changes:<br />
<br />
- Set focus to the Search By Keyword textbox when the page loads. This should be a 1-liner in JavaScript.<br />
<br />
- Create a dropdown in the user options page to select a default forum to search.<br />
<br />
With those implemented, users could load the search page, immediately type in their query, and click enter to submit it for (optionally) the only forum they wish to search.<br />
<br />
Again, these are very minor enhancements, but over the course of thousands of searches, they can save a lot of time.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have their own way to search quicker, or did I overlook something (as usual)?</div></div><hr />

You can also use your browser's quick search function and add a search using http://forums.winamp.com/search.php?forumchoice=65&amp;searchdate=-1&amp;beforeafter=after&amp;action=simplesearch&amp;query=QUERYGOESHERE.</div></div><hr />

Using a bookmark with a %s is what I really wanted but didn't think was possible with the way the query was passed. This helps a lot, thanks!</div></div><hr />
