<br />
I am currently writing an installer and i have been asked if it would be possible to update xml files inside a .rar file.  Does anyone know if this is possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

<br />
I suppose the archiver doesnt really matter, once i have found a way to alter the file inside, which is my main problem then i will look into using a archiver that will be ok with it.  Have you got any idea/samples or how i could acheive this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

2) Modify (FileRead/Write or CopyFiles/Delete)<br />
3) Compress (ExecWait)<br />
<br />
Where's the problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks<br />
