<br />
I'm fuzzy on how to actually invoke the system.dll plug-in to set an environment variable. The following archive link shows two ways to accomplish this and I'm attempting to use the first approach described ... but it isn't working for me:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=161<br />
<br />
Here is TestSetEnv.nsi, which I would think would cause the environment variable &quot;DID_IT_WORK&quot; to &quot;YES&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Name &quot;TestSetEnv&quot;<br />
OutFile &quot;TestSetEnv_setup.exe&quot;<br />
InstallDir $PROGRAMFILES\TestSetEnv<br />
InstallDirRegKey HKLM SOFTWARE\TestSetEnv &quot;Install_Dir&quot;<br />
<br />
Section &quot;TestSetEnv (req with s/w)&quot;<br />
  SectionIn RO<br />
  SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
<br />
  StrCpy $R0 &quot;YES&quot; <br />
  system::Call 'Kernel32::SetEnvironmentVariableA(t, t) i(&quot;DID_IT_WORK&quot;, $R0).r0'<br />
<br />
SectionEnd <br />
<br />
<br />
When I try something very similar, nothing seems to happen. Is there something else I need to do in my script to let the system.dll plug-in be used?<br />
<br />
How do I have the environment variable DID_IT_WORK be created with the value &quot;YES&quot;?<br />
<br />
I looked at the top of the compiler output, and system::call was shown.<br />
<br />
&lt;/alert&gt;</div></div><hr />

If you want to set it for the entire system, use WriteEnvStr (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Setting_Environment_Variables).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ldajunk</div><div class="date">4th June 2005, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh ... now it is becoming much clearer &lt;g&gt;<br />
<br />
Thanks. Seems to work fine. I can now look in &quot;System&quot; + &quot;Environment Variable&quot; and see that DID_IT_WORK is set to &quot;YES&quot;. Also, I can start a &quot;DosPrompt&quot; window and have <br />
C:&gt; set di<br />
confirm that DID_IT_WORK is &quot;YES&quot;. Cool.<br />
<br />
A related (followup) question ... I tried to have the TestSetEnv.nsi have a confirming MessageBox that it worked. In the snippet from that script below, I was expecting:<br />
<br />
* R0 would have the TEMP value (worked)<br />
<br />
* R1 would be blank (yes)<br />
<br />
* R2 would have &quot;YES&quot; (was still blank)<br />
<br />
Is there some kind of delay or sync?<br />
<br />
  ReadEnvStr $R0 TEMP<br />
  ReadEnvStr $R1 DID_IT_WORK<br />
  <br />
  Push &quot;DID_IT_WORK&quot;<br />
  Push &quot;YES&quot;<br />
<br />
  Call WriteEnvStr<br />
  <br />
  ReadEnvStr $R2 DID_IT_WORK<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK &quot;RO (TEMP) is set to $R0 \<br />
                   $\r$\nR1 (before) is set to $R1 \<br />
                   $\r$\nR2 (after) is set to $R2&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th June 2005, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">WriteEnvStr only updates running processes that are capable of updating the environment on runtime. The only process I know that does this is explorer.exe. NSIS doesn't do it and that's what you're seeing. For it to update immediately, you need to use the previous method you've used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ldajunk</div><div class="date">4th June 2005, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. I can certainly live with that. It isn't important to the nsis installer that the environment variable got set ... the application is what cares.<br />
<br />
And THANKS VERY MUCH for the very timely, patient, and helpful replies.<br />
<br />
Just wondering, if the WriteEnvStr routine had a problem, would it be detected by IfErrors in the calling script? I didn't see any error handling in the WriteEnvStr.nsh code, but I'm not all that experienced at looking at nsis script.<br />
<br />
What would be the &quot;best practices code&quot; to make sure the environment variable was set (such as if an NT/Xp user didn't have admin privilege)?<br />
<br />
Would the following snippet be appropriate:<br />
<br />
Push &quot;DID_IT_WORK&quot;<br />
Push &quot;YES&quot;<br />
ClearErrors<br />
Call WriteEnvStr<br />
IfErrors WriteEnvStrProblem  WriteEvnStrOk <br />
<br />
Or does WriteEnvStr.nsh fail &quot;silently&quot;?</div></div><hr />
