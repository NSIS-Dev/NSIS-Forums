<br />
I have searched the board extensively to find solutions to my many issues, and did find some useful posts. But I just want to post to clear a few things up...<br />
<br />
I'm new to NSIS, and am having problems simply understanding the structure. I have read the documentation, but I don't find it to be that accessible for a non-dev type like me... I have also looked at the tutorials, but many of them are out of date/don't cover much. Are there any tutorials or walkthroughs for absolute beginners?<br />
<br />
I'm making an installer that downloads a script in zip form, extracts it, configures the script and then uploads it. So far I've managed to do everything apart from the configure (because the nsDialogs stuff completely confuses me)<br />
<br />
Any pointers on a good place to start (again) or anything else like that?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Andy</div></div><hr />
