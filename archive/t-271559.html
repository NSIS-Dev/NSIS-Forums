<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theblazingangel</div><div class="date">22nd May 2007, 02:56</div></div><div class="posttext">i've got a text box on a custom page. i'm writing some results into it. i write each result on a new line, each line consists of the name of the check, two tabs, three dots, a tab, and the result.<br />
<br />
problem: depending on the length of the text in each name the preceding tabs may not line up the text that follows with other lines.<br />
<br />
i tried counting the length of the names and varying the number of tabs that followed (1 or 2), however it's not just the length of the text that affects it but the width of the characters in the font itself. for example a capital 'W' is a lot wider than a lot of other characters!<br />
<br />
is there anything i can do to get the text to line up correctly? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">22nd May 2007, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to use a fixed character width font such as Courier New.<br />
<br />
What I would do is find the maximum possible length of the first string, second string etc, then you can work out how many spaces you need (tabs are bad) to space everything out perfectly. However, this would require a lot of code in NSIS (you'd probably have to use the NSISArray plugin).<br />
<br />
Maybe it'd be easier to use the EmbeddedLists plugin (http://nsis.sf.net/EmbeddedLists_plug-in).<br />

<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
