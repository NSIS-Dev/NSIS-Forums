<br />
Apologies if this has been answered elsewhere, but I've searched the forums and can't quite seem to find a solution to my problem. I have to produce a CD installer for several thousand files (which take up almost all of the CD), I need the application to run from CD and also to be installed to the hard drive thus negating the use of a compiled installer executable.<br />
<br />
The CopyFiles function at first look would appear to solve my problem, in that it will allow me to copy the application and all itâ€™s associated files from the CD. The problem comes with the requirement to update the files, which would ideally be done using â€œSetOverwrite ifnewerâ€, but if I understand the documentation and another posting on the forums, SetOverwrite will not work with the CopyFiles function???<br />
<br />
Is there any simple way to copy a lot of files from CD to HardDisk whilst only replacing those that are newer? Any help, advise or examples would be hugely appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
M</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd need to use something like:<br />
