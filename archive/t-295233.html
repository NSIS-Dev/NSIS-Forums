<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">29th July 2008, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that makensis.nsi uses a feature named &quot;Memento&quot;.<br />
<br />
I searched for it in the NSIS User Manual and all I could I find is:Added Memento.nsh for easy persistency of user selections across different runs of the installer I searched this forum too and all I could find are problem postings related to Memento but now explaining really how it works and how to use it:<br />

I even found RFE #1677624 but all it says is:the installer of NSIS should remember the settings previously specified. such as &quot;uninstall before installation&quot; (because i always use the other option) and also for the components page. previously disabled sections should be deselected by default when upgrading. <br />
<br />
Is there some place where I can learn more about Memento?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

There are lots of comments at the beginning of the file... ;)  Thank you! I looked at Memento.nsh and it seems to be exactly what I was looking for.<br />
