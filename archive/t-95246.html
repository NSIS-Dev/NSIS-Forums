<br />
I've seen a lot of people want to turn logging on and/or other switches in NSIS but who don't have the ability to compile NSIS and so can't do this.<br />
<br />
I am more than happy to build versions of NSIS with various switches changed and host them on my archive site (not as offical downloads obviously, they will be well marked as &quot;built by me&quot; rather than Justin).. <br />
<br />
If this is a crap idea just tell me so ;) <br />
<br />
(btw I would not be offering any support for these versions, all I would be doing is changing switches in the nsis configuration header file and rebuilding the code then hosting the binary, not a full download of NSIS).<br />
<br />
Therefore if anyone wants such a build please email or PM me and I will host a version with the switches you desire.</div></div><hr />

thanks for this great offer. Your support will be rewarded by making this post a sticky on the Forum. Besides that I closed the topic to encourage people to visit the NSIS Archive (http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki) and post comments there.<br />
<br />
Thx, greetz,<br />
