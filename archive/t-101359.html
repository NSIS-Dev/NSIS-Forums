when you put a line with &quot;ReadRegStr ...&quot; on a script,the line is executed when you launch the executable file creating by compiling the script and not when you compile the script!!!<br />
 Is there any solution to execute such a line when I compile the script? <br />
<br />
Tank you.:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">KiCHiK - I think we need a marker in the documentation to say which commands are compile time commands and which are runtime commands. A lot of people fall foul of this distinction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david33470</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact i have an installation script whith a lot of section an subsection and for the uninstallation i made another nsi script, and i want to guive a value to the uninstalation script before compiling it to know where to find in the registry what it need. i think that the best solution is a key in the registry, but i can have several version of my software on a pc so if i install a second version i have to be able to uninstall the first and the second version too.<br />
so the key should be a value that depend of the version of my software, so i have to give the value when i compile the script of the uninstal part (in fact i compile this script when i install the software) .<br />
i hope that we have a solution for me to read the reg value when i compile the script, if you have understand my bad english (sorry but I'm french).<br />
tank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sunjammer, there is a pretty clear speration in the documents between instructions and compiler flags/installer attributes.</div></div><hr />
