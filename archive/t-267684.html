 ;some code <br />
<br />
<br />
In my installer at some point i'm just checking if $Uninstall flag is set if it is set then i'm writing the uninstaller to temp folder &amp; running it. After it finishes i'm deleting the uninstaller that i've written &amp; quiting the my installer. But when i open my task maneger there is still Setup.exe running in processes. Why is this happening ?<br />
Any solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Remove the 'HideWindow' from your code to check out if your installer ever goes to 'Quit'.<br />
<br />
P.S. '$WINDIR\Temp' is kind of improper that might become potential dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darshanaltekar</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">if i remove the hide window the window is there but after my uninstaller is finished it doesnt quit the setup?<br />
Any solution i want to quit the installer from which i invoked Uninstaller :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">This means the script doesn't move ahead to execute the 'Quit' command, probably remains in 'ExecWait'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darshanaltekar</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">so how can i quit my installer plese Eed Wine suggest something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already suggested about the proper usage a few days ago in another post you were asking the same question.<br />
The included example makensis.nsi shows the proper usage and it's pretty self explained :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darshanaltekar</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen that example &amp; modified the code as <br />
<br />
 strcmp $UNINSTALL &quot;YES&quot; 0 end<br />
  hidewindow<br />
  writeuninstaller $WINDIR\temp\un_kat.exe<br />
  execwait $WINDIR\temp\un_kat.exe<br />
  IfErrors no_remove_uninstaller<br />
  IfFileExists &quot;$WINDIR\temp\un_kat.exe&quot; no_remove_uninstaller<br />
   Delete &quot;$WINDIR\temp\un_kat.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
    no_remove_uninstaller:<br />
<br />
<br />
  strcmp $UNINSTALL &quot;YES&quot; 0 +2<br />
  quit<br />
  bringtofront<br />
  end:<br />
<br />
still same problem is there. Any suggestion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I'm not able to figure what you're trying to achieve plus already mentioned  writeuninstaller $WINDIR\temp\un_kat.exe is improper unless you want to remove files into $WINDIR\temp.<br />
Assuming that you ask users if they want to remove a previous installation before continue with the current, the makensis.exe is the way to go.<br />
That's all I can say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darshanaltekar</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">In man installer i'm droping the welcome screen &amp; showing custome window with three radio buttons as Repair,Modify &amp; Uninstall, if it founds that the application is already installed. If user select uninstall then i'm setting the uninstall flag , writting the uninstaller to temp folder, executing uninstaller from there &amp; now i wnt to quit my installer. But after uninstaller is finished , i'm not able to quit my installer ie it is still showing setup.exe in Task manager.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if app is already installed then uninstaller is already exists into $INSTDIR right?<br />
Try to execute that uninstaller using the method demonstrated in makensis.nsi and then quit instead of continue the installation.<br />
I don't know if the uninstaller that you're writing into temp has some special code to do special things...<br />
Your installer remains running because it does not go to the Quit command.</div></div><hr />
