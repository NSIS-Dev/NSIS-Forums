<br />
I need to add some shares to my installer. To add a share I us e &quot;net share Sharename=Drive:Path&quot; and It work. But I need also to add the User Everyone to have full access. On Win2k3 it is possible to add an &quot;/GRANT:user,rights&quot; to the command. This command isn't available on Win2k or WinXP. <br />
Is there a Plugin or Command which I can use to add/remove/change Users to shares (access rights)?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for every feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is another problem. When I use the Plugin it works ... but when I change the access rights for \\PCNAME\Path the same rights are also set for the local path (e.g. c:\xyz\share\path). In the dir are ini which should be writable for the application (local) but not for the networkshare (remote pc).<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

A file can't have two different sets of access privileges. Either a user can or can't access it. It shouldn't matter if a user tries to connect from a remote computer or from the local computer.</div></div><hr />

I want to change the &quot;Share Permissons&quot; for the User Everyone.<br />
<br />
But with the Plugin I am only able to change the &quot;Security Permissions&quot; ... see here:<br />

How to change the &quot;Share Permissions&quot; for the User everyone?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support,<br />

AccessControl can't do that. You can set share permissions using the NetShareSetInfo API with the 1501 data level. You can use the System plug-in to call that or write a little plug-in of your own.<br />
<br />
You can also use SetACL (http://setacl.sourceforge.net/) to set the share permissions.</div></div><hr />
