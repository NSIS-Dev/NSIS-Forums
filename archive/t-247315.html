<br />
We've been doing some tests lately with NSIS and this morning I downloaded the 2.14 release from <br />
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22049&amp;package_id=15374<br />
for my computer.<br />
What was my surprise, after installing it, when I found out that the file 'zilb' in 'stubs' was infected by Win32/SillyDL.1gl!Trojan .<br />
I also found out that ALL setup made with this version are also infected...<br />
I'm using Etrust Anti-virus and for so long it's quite accurate.<br />
Could someone tell me I'm wrong and that a bunch of app out there are not infected :(<br />
<br />
I also checked the lastest release (2.17) a it seems fine...for now.<br />
Also note that we've been using release 2.14 since 2 monthes now and the trojan has been detected only since this week-end. I guess it might be a mistake but.... :)<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

Thanks, that's what I though too. I'll send them the 'infected' file and ask them to double check it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
