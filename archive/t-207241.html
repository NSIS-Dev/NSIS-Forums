<br />
i'm using XP Pro , NTFS and i get following error after it's going to compress last file!<br />
<br />
File: &quot;Textures.pak&quot; [compress]<br />
Internal compiler error #12345: error mmapping file (1287573784, 33554432) is out of range.<br />
<br />
Note: you may have one or two (large) stale temporary file(s)<br />
left in your temporary directory (Generally this only happens on Windows 9x).<br />
<br />
i tried change Temp dir to another place where i had 30GB free space, and it used about 700mb before reaching this file so can't be space problem!<br />
<br />
Textures.pak is bit over 700mb file!<br />
<br />
installer VISE had no problems making setup of all files but it cost and NSIS is free so rather use NSIS!<br />
<br />
Update!<br />
-------<br />
tried use bzip2 instead and it worked but not zlib, then i get error above!</div></div><hr />

Is your swap space limited in any way? Or is your memory usage already very high?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I receive the same error. Already moved my temp directory to my secondary hard drive which has 77 GB free.<br />
<br />
I am trying to pack a big installer. A few files are 500 - 900 MB.<br />
<br />
The error only appears while processing those big files.<br />
<br />
Internal compiler error #12345: error mmapping file (1700401933, 33554432) is out of range.  Note: you may have one or two (large) stale temporary file(s) left in your temporary directory (Generally this only happens on Windows 9x). <br />
<br />
My laptop has 4 GB of RAM and is running Win XP Professional.<br />
Would be nice if anybody could give me a hint.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CG!</div><div class="date">8th February 2010, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The maximum datasize is 2GB (no, not 2147483648 byte) and all files together, that are going to be part of the installer , should not exeed this limit.<br />
<br />
Try using an plugin like 7z or zip.</div></div><hr />
