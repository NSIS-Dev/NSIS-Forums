<br />
I package a library with nsis, and would like to add<br />
include and library paths to Developer Studio.<br />
<br />
The solution I came up with was to modify the<br />
file \Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\VCComponents.dat<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there a more elegant approach?<br />
I ask because some people who install our softeware<br />
told me that there is no such file on their computer,<br />
and also for VisualStudio 8.0 the file is in Unicode.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

However, I'm sure MSDN contains all the required information.<br />
<br />
A quick search came up with something that seems related:<br />
