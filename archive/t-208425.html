<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tbreina</div><div class="date">21st February 2005, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm installing a program using NSIS and would like to run the installed program after it installs. This is no problem if I add<br />
<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;$INSTDIR\devcpp.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
to the Modern User Interface options.<br />
<br />
My problem is that the program (devcpp.exe) seems to be running from within the install package directory and not the $INSTDIR.  I know this because the devcpp.exe program searches for some directories at startup and can't find them (they are referenced as {current_dir}\include rather than as an absolute path like c:\dev-cpp\include). <br />
<br />
If I run the program from outside of the NSIS installer, devcpp.exe finds the referenced directories just fine (I assume because the default directory is set correctly). <br />
<br />
Has anyone run into this before?<br />
<br />
Could I somehow do <br />
<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;cd $INSTDIR; $INSTDIR\devcpp.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
to change the working directory first and then run the program using that working directory? (NOTE: That code doesn't seem to work).<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

In the defined function, use SetOutPath to set the current working directory prior to executing devcpp.exe.</div></div><hr />
