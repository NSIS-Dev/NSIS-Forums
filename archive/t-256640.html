<br />
Question: What would be the best way to alter or edit the Install page during runtime.  I have 2 purposes for this.  First, in one of my larger installers (really a monthly update) I would love to be able to rotate through 2-4 informational BMP images while the installer is working.  Secondly, I have an installer that I made for internal purposes that my co-workers use to scan some proprietary files.  Right now, as it scans I give the user feedback on # of files scanned, and # of errors found just using the &quot;Detail Print&quot; command, but I would love to be able to have some more space, and use the bottom 2/3s of the Install Page.<br />
<br />
I know with the Welcome and Finish pages, you can edit these stock Pages at runtime using the iospecial.ini, but the stock Install Page does not have this functionality.  So is there another way to edit at runtime the Install Page, or would it be better to just us a custom page with Stu's RealProgress (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/RealProgress_plug-in) plug instead?  Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always call SetWindowPos to move the dialog controls during runtime. However, it'd be simpler for you to use Resource Hacker as Joel suggested. For the first installer, add a bitmap place holder and then use LoadImage and SendMessage to set the image. An example (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ModernUI_Mod_to_Display_Images_while_installing_files) is available on the Wiki. For the second installer, simply add two labels and change their text at runtime using SendMessage and WM_SETTEXT.</div></div><hr />
