<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaMsTeYr</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, i'm not sure if i should post a new topic, but it was the quickest way to see if someone can help me. Tried searching the forums for keywords to what i wanted to achieve, but found nothing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what i wanted to ask was whether it was possible to split the installer, like for example, compressing files which total up to large sized (e.g. 3gb+) will take a long time for the installer to verify contents in the beginning, as well as when burnt onto a media, chances of retrieving data when the installer is corrupt would be lower.<br />
<br />
I want to know if i can split the files, an installer, (e.g. Setup.exe) and the content to install, while still using the lzma compression. Its kinda hard to explain, but its something like how games install, as u notice their files are split in like 1.cab, 2.cab so on so forth. <br />
<br />
Hope i didn't confuse anyone too badly ^^</div></div><hr />
