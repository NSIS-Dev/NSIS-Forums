<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DigitalPimp247</div><div class="date">22nd January 2004, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if this has been answered before or because I really don't know what to do a search for. So I apologize now if it has been answered previously. Also keep in mind I'm so new to this you could say I was &quot;born&quot; today. :)<br />
<br />
I have two applications that I want to put on a single cd. I downloaded NSIS to create an interface for installing these two programs, but now I'm not so sure if NSIS is the right program for this. So with that, here's what I want to do:<br />
<br />
The cd will contain the usual autorun.ini, SetUp.exe and an icon. It will also have two subdirectories (one for each program). I would like to have the SetUp.exe autorun (easy part) and bring up a GUI that contains four buttons: button one will point to the setup.exe in subdirectory one, button two for setup.exe in subdirectory two, button three to install both applications (if possible) and a quit button.<br />
<br />
Is this at all possible with NSIS?<br />
<br />
TIA!</div></div><hr />

I'll just dig into the FAQ a little more...</div></div><hr />
