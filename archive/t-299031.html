<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">losernoob</div><div class="date">23rd October 2008, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I've checked where I can, but I probably haven't done enough. It's late here, and I'm pretty tired. I don't have a lot of time to do this, so I thought I'd better put up my question as sson as possible. Again, I'm sorry if this has already been answered.<br />
<br />
I am making an extremely simple CD-based installer. I want my files to remain separate from my installer, as installation is more a convenience than a necessity.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I want to do the following:<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Open a dialog box that gives the user the ability to either continue with the install, or cancel the process.<br />
 Copy all files (including folders) from the CD to a directory on the HD.<br />
 Create a special folder made of specially crafted shortcuts on the desktop.*<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
So is this possible (and fairly simple coding) for this language, or do I need to look for a more all-purpose solution?<br />
<br />
<br />
 * In case you wanted to know, I have to run the installed programs through DOSBox. I am making a CD of a friend's DOS programs so they can easily be installed on Windows, as he knows next to nothing about computers. (He didn't even know the programs were DOS programs...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Use a message box in the .onInit function<br />
2.  Use CopyFiles<br />
3.  use CreateShortcut (with maybe CreateDirectory)<br />
<br />
Even the most basic install should do what you want.  The best way to learn is just jump in an start playing!  :D <br />
<br />
(Have a look at some of the samples with NSIS and the help files to get you started.)</div></div><hr />
