<br />
There's so many differences between the two (win.ini vs environment variables, setting up shortcuts for current user vs. setting up shortcuts for all users under NT/2000), that I'd like to know what the best minds of NSIS recommend...<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">0mar</div><div class="date">22nd March 2002, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a funtion that comes with NSIS that checks Windows versions.<br />
<br />
In your NSIS directory, look for &quot;functions.htm&quot; - in that file, examine the 'GetWindowsVersion' function. You can use it as is or modify it to suit your needs...</div></div><hr />
