<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">24th May 2009, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not really an NSIS question but knowing the great minds here and given that my Windows EXE is generated by NSIS, I am hoping to find a hint or tip here (I combed the web but found no answer, yet):<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to extract, using a bash script running on Linux, the FileVersion information embedded in my NSIS installers. The idea is that the bas script will call an external program that actually extract thatFileVersion info.<br />
<br />
So far, I only managed to use 'strings':<br />
strings -e l mywindowsexename.exe <br />
Which results in two separate lines for FileVersion and its information. Thus a simple line manipulation program such as grep or sed won't suffice.<br />
<br />
Any tip or pointer to how to accomplish this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The information is stored as a resource in the executable, as described at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa381058.aspx. So what you need is a way to navigate the resources in executables - I believe http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/bb985992.aspx and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301808.aspx will get you far with this part.<br />
<br />
Once you know the format, it should be (relatively) trivial to write this external program in C or some other langauge.</div></div><hr />

I was actually looking for a shortcut that doesn't involve a programming mini-project. I just came up with a one-liner that seems to work. I am posting it here for the benefit of all:<br />
strings -e l mywindowsinstaller.exe | sed -e :a -e '/FileVersion$/N; s/FileVersion\n/FileVersion /; ta' | grep FileVersion | cut -d ' ' -f 2<br />
