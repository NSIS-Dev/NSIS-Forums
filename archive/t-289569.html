<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrDan</div><div class="date">3rd April 2008, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to add a section to an installer/uninstaller dynamically?<br />
<br />
The sceanario I have been presented with is as follows.<br />
<br />
I have an installer that deploys a set of tools. The installer is very flexible in that it can be re-run repeatedly to install tools that weren't selected on first install.<br />
<br />
As part of an &quot;update&quot; to this set of tools, a new tool is to be added. The &quot;update&quot; is actually a cut-down version of the main installer, just deploying the new tool, and perhaps upgrades to the tools that need them.<br />
<br />
The idea would be that the &quot;update&quot; installer would be run, and somehow &quot;register&quot; the fact with the main installer that this new tool exists. We've covered the scenario about new tools being available via a configuration file.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to add a section to the components page that displays this new tool?<br />
<br />
My first thoughts are that the answer is &quot;no&quot; since sections are created in the installer during its compilation.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know better?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The short answer is no, you can't add a sections dynamically. But like mauvecloud hinted, you can create a number of dummy section that are then modified with SectionSet* commands at run time.</div></div><hr />
