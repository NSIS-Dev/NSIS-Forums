Still, no one seems to know why, when my program installs from NSIS, XP refuses to highlight the start menu items and show a pop-up bubble with the words &quot;new programs installed&quot;.<br />
<br />
What have I missed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you have the option disabled. Right Click in the taskbar-&gt;properties-&gt;Start Menu tab-&gt;customize the start menu-&gt;Ooptions (second tab)-&gt;check for the highlight thing.</div></div><hr />

It is probably a Windows problem or a problem with your configuration.</div></div><hr />

In short, you just need to have a version resource in your executable.<br />

Probably a bit too late for this thread, but others might find this useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, NSIS just packages your executable as-is. You have to add the &quot;version info&quot; resource to the executable with whatever development environment (tool chain) you are using the develop/build your executable (e.g. Visual Studio).<br />
<br />
BTW: NSIS can add a &quot;version info&quot; resource to the installer executable, but that's not what you want here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adeeshah</div><div class="date">15th August 2011, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">No it doesn't work. I added the version info to my installer executable using the NSIS and i also added the version info to my packaged executable using the .rc file and then comipling it with windres but they are still not highlighted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">15th August 2011, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you verify that the version info is present, e.g. by checking the file properties in Explorer?<br />
<br />
Also did you read this:<br />

<br />
Especially:<br />
* Once you've run a program, it is no longer marked as &quot;new&quot;.<br />
* Shortcuts more than a week old. Clearly you aren't interested in those any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adeeshah</div><div class="date">15th August 2011, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, the version information is added to the installer as well as the executable. See here,<br />

<br />
- I haven't run the program yet.<br />
- the shortcut is new.<br />

Is it enabled on your system? (Start Menu properties - Customize - check  &quot;highlight newly installed programs&quot; )</div></div><hr />

<br />
NSIS is a great script and my installer is working perfect the only problem left is that new programs are not highlighted...........i am sure i am making some stupid mistake here.....but if some NSIS guru can post a sample script that would be really great!!!!!!<br />
