<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackwidow</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">what would be the best way to go about deleting the installation executable after it finishes, and perhaps the directory it is in as well?<br />
<br />
  I have a special case where the clients will be auto-updating with this installer which needs to move the program to a different location and essentially leave nothing of the old program/directory behind. (the program name has changed)<br />
<br />
  thanks for the help.  I'll see what I can dig up too.<br />

<br />
<br />
Function .onInstSuccess<br />
Delete $EXEDIR\theinstaller.exe<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this help</div></div><hr />

Or, you can make a warpper which will just extract your real mover to the temporary directory, execute it and delete it with /REBOOTOK, which is exactly what the uninstaller does.</div></div><hr />
