<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PeterSmith</div><div class="date">17th March 2006, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">So I've figured out how to use NSIS to refresh my desktop (required by installers in the &quot;February&quot; version of Vista -- if you add an icon to the all-users desktop it doesn't show up until you refresh).<br />
<br />
I'd like to add it to the Wiki -- and I can't figure it out.  When I click on 'edit' the page for the obvious page (Category:System_Plugin_Example) the resulting page is tiny and doesn't contain anything that I recognize as a sample.  Certainly the 20 samples that are in the regular page don't show up at all.<br />
<br />
I'm obviously missing something.  How can I add my (nicely documented) sample to the Wiki?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Peter</div></div><hr />

Simply &quot;go&quot; to the page you want to create (change the URL in your browser) and edit it.<br />
<br />
BTW, is this requirement documented anywhere or is it just something that's still missing in Vista?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PeterSmith</div><div class="date">17th March 2006, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you.  I knew how to make wiki pages (we use them here at work, and I've made very minor edits in Wikipedia before), but I didn't know how to plug my page into the right spot in the Category:System Examples page.<br />
<br />
It's much more clear now -- when I looked at another sample code page instead of the category page I saw the 'category' comment in the page.  Just putting one of those into my page automatically put my page into the right category.<br />
<br />
It wasn't very obvious as first, but it's not rocket science either.  My new page (&quot;Refresh Desktop&quot;) is now up.<br />
