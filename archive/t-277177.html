<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImBcmDth</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been playing around with the various interface options and decided to port my test downloader to the UltraModern UI. The only issue I have run across so far is that the download progress bar isn't drawn in the Ultramodern UI. If I use the ModernUI then it works as normal.<br />
<br />
Is this a known issue with UMUI?<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out how the UMUI differs in the creation of the window. Running in a debugger, I can see that NSISdl gets something for the HWND of the parent window. I am just not sure which window's handle it is getting because it does all the drawing but there is no control to be seen.<br />

<br />
It is a known issue.<br />
<br />
This is a workaround:<br />
Simply, add this section before all others in your code:<br />
		Section &quot;&quot;<br />
			SetDetailsPrint none<br />
<br />
			Push $0<br />
			Push $8<br />
<br />
			FindWindow $0 &quot;#32770&quot; &quot;&quot; $HWNDPARENT<br />
			GetDlgItem $8 $0 1004<br />
			System::Call &quot;user32::InvalidateRect(i,i,i)i (r8, 0, 1).r4&quot;<br />
<br />
			Pop $8<br />
			Pop $0<br />
<br />
			SetDetailsPrint both<br />
		SectionEnd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImBcmDth</div><div class="date">11th September 2007, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help but that didn't seem to work. I notice you are getting a handle to and invalidating the standard install progress bar control. That particular control displays fine. :(<br />
<br />
My problem is with the secondary progress bar that NSISdl displays (and I assume other download plugins.) As it is now, NSISdl gets a handle for the two &quot;details&quot; controls and hides them (which works) then creates another static text box and a second progress bar. Both function calls seem to succeed in the debugger (I get handles to the controls) but neither show up! I am wondering if they are behind something but all this is a new world for me - I never did much UI programming.<br />
<br />
This issue is the only thing keeping me from using a beautifully skinned installer instead of the same ol' boring thing. After all my pixel pushing this is getting to me! :D<br />
<br />
I am looking for something I can do to fix this from within NSISdl. There maybe a way to improve its window handling code so that workarounds aren't neccessary but I start getting nervous when I see all the HWNDs flying around. That esoteric art simply isn't my forte. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImBcmDth</div><div class="date">11th September 2007, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I found out that (almost) everything works if I remove the &quot;WS_CLIPSIBLINGS&quot; style from the progress bar and static text that NSISdl creates. There doesn't seem to be any flickering and the plugin still works in the old school interface.<br />
<br />
I also modified the code to copy the &quot;ctlcolors&quot; structure to the new static text from the old so that the created progress text matches the general theme. <br />
<br />
So everything seems to work now, thanks for the help. :) <br />
