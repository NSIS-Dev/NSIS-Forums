:) en!I use the NSIS from 200409,And this is my first question!Because I can find all I want in the Forum before.<br />
But now!I can't.<br />
In my app_Inst.exe, I want install the third part plugin.and I want let the plugin info display in the component page.So far,that seems a easy question.But the last step is: all the information is contained in a inifile,and the inifile localed at the same dir of app_inst.exe,when the exe started, I find the inifile,load the information,and then gen the component page to the user,that the user can select them!and the plugin_inst.exe also at the same dir!the last thing is ExectWait...<br />
En~that's all I want!~<br />
Is there any way to solve it?<br />
Thanks!<br />
waiting......!:)</div></div><hr />

This won't stop the Section being executed though... You'd have to jump over the code inside it using StrCmp or something (if a variable equals something).<br />
See SectionSetText in the NSIS chm manual (under index) for setting.<br />

Thank you!<br />
I will write my acknowledgement for you in my app_license!<br />
