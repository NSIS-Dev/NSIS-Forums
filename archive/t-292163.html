<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">obicharon</div><div class="date">23rd May 2008, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">So i would like to start by saying that my problem is shortcut deletion related. I know that are lots of topics on this matter and i've read them all. Still i have the following problem <br />
 <br />
  I have an installer for my program . The script that generates the installer uses RequestExecutionLevel admin. All works well with it (creating the shortcut, deleting them on uninstall ...the works).<br />
  Now the problematic part: <br />
  I am doing a patch for the installed program. This patch will rewrite the executable of the program. This new executable has a new name, different from the old one (cant  use the old name, and pls don't ask why a new name... this is not relevant :) ). So ...at this moment i have to redo the Start menu icon to point to the new executable, and the desktop one too . So the way i've done it in the patch script is to delete the old shortcuts and make new one for the new  executable. <br />
  Works well for the desktop one. Does not work for the start menu one. The script for the patch also uses     RequestExecutionLevel admin <br />
<br />
In the original installer the SM icon is created like <br />
<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\${PRODUCT_NAME}\$firmName\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\${EXE_NAME}&quot;<br />
<br />
In the patch is deleted like <br />
<br />
Delete &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\${PRODUCT_NAME}\$firmName\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk&quot;<br />
<br />
i have looked in the patch and message boxed the delete string and the path is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">23rd May 2008, 09:03</div></div><div class="posttext">First question: Are you absolutely sure that PRODUCT_NAME etc are defined exactly the same as in the original installer? You did mention that your exe filename changed...<br />
<br />
Edit: In fact, it's bad form to use a variable to delete files whose names are entirely fixed (that is, not variable). Just use<br />
<br />
Delete $MSPROGRAMS\full path as it was used in the first installer\full filename as it was used.lnk<br />
Delete $MSPROGRAMS\full path as it was used in another earlier installer\full filename as it was used2.lnk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">obicharon</div><div class="date">23rd May 2008, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">MSG ..thanks for the reply ... been staring at the script for 2.5 hours (the script won the staring contest :) ) and found the problem. As usually it was just in front of my eyes but i've overlooked it over and over and over again ( one extraspace in   PRODUCT_NAME in patch ...pfff). Sometimes just talking with someone helps :). <br />
 Thanks. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />
