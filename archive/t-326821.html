<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vjrabanelly</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
I've been looking for it a lot in this forum and in Google and didn't find the exact answer I was looking for...<br />
<br />
I created an installer using nsDialogs after reading that InstallOptions got deprecated. Everything went well so far but now I'd like to resize the window. I did modify dialog 105 in modern.exe with ResHacker, but it doesn't change anything in nsDialogs.<br />
<br />
So, is it possible to modify the size of the window in any way for nsDialogs? Where does nsDialogs gets its dimensions from?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Valentin</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do know how to use ResHacker, but I didn't find the file I need to hack. In NSIS\Contrib\UIs, I tried every executable and only found 1033 controls.<br />
<br />
It looks like there are no such things as 1018 or 1044 controls in modern.exe or standard.exe or even nsDialogs.dll...<br />
<br />
Could you please tell me where I find these controls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">4th February 2011, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You missed it. 1018 is in dialog 105 of modern.exe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vjrabanelly</div><div class="date">4th February 2011, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I found it now. So I modify the dimensions from ResHacker, only for 1018 and 1044 in C:\%ProgFiles%\NSIS\Contrib\UIs\modern.exe, dialog 105.<br />
<br />
But when I launch my NSIS script (which uses nsDialogs::Create 1018), nothing changes. It looks like it doesn't take into account any changes in modern.exe because even if I delete it, it doesn't say anything and opens always with the same dimensions.<br />
<br />
Anders and ZmAn3, are you talking about nsDialogs or MUI? <br />
Do I have to do something more to indicate to NSIS to take new changes into account? <br />
Do I have to modify other values than just 1018 and 1044 width and height?<br />
<br />
Thank you! Your help is much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vjrabanelly</div><div class="date">4th February 2011, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. I can even see the result in opening the modern.exe directly after my modifications.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZmAn3</div><div class="date">7th February 2011, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">i could be wrong but i think it uses both uis when compiling with mui2 anyways grab this it has a resized ui and sample script i have a few more if you need them<br />

<br />
I wasn't using an InstFiles page, so NSIS didn't execute the install section. I did it on purpose since I didn't want any instFiles page, but I didn't know it wouldn't accept to show a custom UI in this case. So I added some lines to add an InstFiles page with MUI and it did the trick :<br />
<br />
!include &quot;MUI2.nsh&quot;<br />
<br />
!define MUI_UI &quot;myCustomUI.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES<br />
<br />
Then, to go back to where I was before (no instFiles page), I added a code which makes my installer quit before loading instFiles page, just as it was doing before :<br />
!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE instFilesPre     ; Just before &quot;!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES&quot;<br />
<br />
Function instFilesPre<br />
    Quit<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
All my code is executed in the leave function of my previous custom page, not in install section. <br />
So now I can resize the UI with ResHacker or ResEdit the way I want it and NSIS takes it into account when compiling! :D<br />
<br />
Thanks again! <br />
<br />
Bye<br />
