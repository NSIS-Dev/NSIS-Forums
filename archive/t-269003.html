<br />
<br />
I want to read the value of the key from the registry.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework<br />
<br />
In this path the Key name is InstalledRoot<br />
<br />
the value is c:/Windows/Microsoft.Net/Framework<br />
<br />
I want to read this value in a variable through NSIS script.<br />
<br />
How to do this? Please Help me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please go easy on me Stu. But I too have browsed your NSIS Wiki pages and would also like to know how to READ A REGISTRY value, from a HTML page, or embedded script therein.<br />
<br />
Further references to voluminous knowledge bases are not helpful.<br />
<br />
Currently, I've tracked it down to this Wscript.shell thingy and I've got a regread.vbs sample working. I just want to wrap that in a HTML page script tag. - but my browser does not seem to be aware of Windows Script Host, i.e. even Wscript.echo method doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Does any1 know how or if possible?<br />
<br />
The objective is to read a particular value (ID) in the visitors registry, then I give them a specific executable which has been prepared for that value / IDentity.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

NSIS script executed through the compiled executable (exe).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am aware of how to do it thru NSIS, in Function .ioInit<br />
<br />
ReadRegStr $OperatorCode HKCU &quot;$(Key)\User&quot; OperatorCode<br />
<br />
i use that after  they have downloaded their exe<br />
<br />
however before I even want to download their specific exe to the specific user,<br />
i wish to read that same registry location and give them their file (exe) only, from the HTML page</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">6th April 2007, 01:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You cant read the registry from a webpage, only IE supports VB script, and I dont think it supports reading the registry from a non local page. But you could create a small &quot;loader&quot; exe that the user can download, it could read the regsitry value and then use execshell to open a specific URL with info from your reg key</div></div><hr />
