<br />
- Is it possible to view a icon in a custompage? (You can view images, but i want to view icons so if the (windows) theme is different it still looks right) and if its possible, How?<br />
<br />
And one little thing. I used to use different bitmaps im my setups (for example: at the left, at the welcome screen) I used a old version and the old way to do it doesn't work anymore in 2.0. I was hoping somebody could tell me how to fix it.<br />
<br />
I hope somebody knows it, thanks for reading anyway ;).<br />

<br />
yes, you can do that using InstallOptions (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Contrib/InstallOptions/Readme.html)<br />

<br />
some of the syntax has been changed during the development builds, you should find the recent syntax in the mui docs (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Contrib/Modern%20UI/Readme.html)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But i still got another question and i dont know i its worth to open a new topic about it so ill ask it here.<br />
<br />
When you look at attached the image, you will see a custom dialog. I made it and i want to have some things i could not find.<br />
<br />
I want that users can choose between 2 checkboxes (Red, Green). So if they choose Green they cant choose Red.<br />
<br />
I hope somebody can tell me how to do this.<br />
<br />
And a second thing is how to automaticly check checkboxes and radiobuttons. (Blue area)<br />
<br />
I hope somebody knows how to do this. It may have been somewhere on the NSIS pages but i didnt find it.:weird:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">you might prefer using a visual editor to create io-pages, such as HM NSI Edit (http://hmne.sourceforge.net/).<br />
<br />
you forgot to attach an image too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cai_sebas</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Something went wrong with the image.<br />
<br />
Ill try it again if it still doesnt work look here:<br />
<br />

<br />
I know such editors as HM NSI Edit. But that are just a few options, not the one i descibed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats how radiobuttons usually behave<br />
<br />

<br />
i guess you are asking for the state of a checkbox, try State=1</div></div><hr />

<br />

Stupid from me that i didnt think of that<br />
<br />
But i want to use 2 pairs of checkboxes (Like in the image). How can i configure this?<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering this. If searched by i didnt managed to get the information i need.<br />
<br />
I want that if 'radiobutton 1' is set a specified regstring is written.<br />
And i want if 'radiobutton 2' is set a different regstring is written.<br />
<br />
i saw this:<br />
Function LeaveFinishPage<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_READ $R0 &quot;Finish Page.ini&quot; &quot;Field 2&quot; &quot;State&quot;<br />
  StrCmp $R0 &quot;1&quot; 0 +2<br />
    ExecShell &quot;open&quot; &quot;program.exe&quot;<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
But the 'ExecShell &quot;open&quot; &quot;program.exe&quot;' doesnt fit for me. I need that a regstring is written. What to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">there's no point in using ExecShell with an executable. try Exec or nsExec.<br />
<br />
for registry manipulation, check the manual (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.9.2)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cai_sebas</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thnx for the advice but it didnt helped me cause i dont know how to use this. S i was hoping that somebody could tell me what to write.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 03:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Use for each first of each pair of radiobuttons with this:<br />
<br />
Flags=GROUP<br />
<br />
NOTE: Every time you put that line at any radiobutton &quot;field&quot;, that control starts a new group of radiobuttons.</div></div><hr />
