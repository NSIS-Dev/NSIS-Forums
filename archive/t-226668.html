<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jnuw</div><div class="date">22nd September 2005, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick question.  I have not been following the updates too closely lately, and I just wanted to be sure there won't be any problems for my nsi scripts if I update my nsis version from 2.06 to 2.09.  Any problems with that?  Thanks.<br />

It's kept small and simple, unlike the change log which contains all changes from the last version. 2.07 contained the biggest release notes (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixF.html#F.3.1) section.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to be sure that File /nonfatal bug (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=1775227#post1775227) behaved the same in 2.09, and figured it was a good time to upgrade.<br />

One other question, when I switch between makensis.exe's (Logging and LongString), do I also have to swap out the new corresponding Stubs folder?</div></div><hr />
