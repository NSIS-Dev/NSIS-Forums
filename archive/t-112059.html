<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 01:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to work with this function. I read, using the search, that we have to compare resulting variables with IntCmpU (Unsigned), but testing with GetFileTime I see that sometimes it returns negative numbers.<br />
<br />
Another thing, how can I get the minutes and seconds from that number? I want that to calculate elapsed time, but it can be useful to calculate current date/time if compared with a file of known date (then we don't have to use a dll:))</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks kichik, that was one of the threads I read before posting.:)<br />
<br />
I still don't understand &quot;I use IntCmpU because a DWORD is an unsigned long&quot; because, as I say in my first post, sometimes GetFileTime returns a signed number. Does sounds to me as a contradiction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">You see it as a signed number because that's how you look at it. Both signed and unsigned numbers are saved as bits of 0 or 1, and the sign depends on how you treat them. If you look at them as signed numbers they will have a sign, if you don't they won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">So, the good way to look at those numbers is as unsigned, ok. But I didn't decide which way I look at those numbers, I just made a DetailPrint.<br />
<br />
The other question: Is there a way I can pull seconds and minutes from that number?<br />
<br />
Thanks for being so patient<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not the good way, it's THE way ;)<br />
<br />
You will have to use brainsucker's System.dll to do this calculation. The FILETIME (which is used to get these two numbers) structure is a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC). I am sorry but I am pretty busy right now so I won't be able to help you with the script... Maybe brainsucker will be able to help you, he know his DLL better than I do anyway :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brainsucker</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I've included such example into just posted release (Sample 6). See examples/system.nsi.</div></div><hr />

is a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals<br />
<br />
So, I can divide for 10^7 and get seconds, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brainsucker</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 02:20</div></div><div class="posttext">hm... there will be a little problem, since GetFileTime return this time as two DWORDS, time=DW1*4294967296+DW2... So you have to do a little calculations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 02:34</div></div><div class="posttext">some calculations? just a substraction, or two because we have two dwords.<br />
<br />
Anyway it's better this than have to work with a dll.<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to add GetCurrentTime function to nsis? Otherwise a function can be made for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brainsucker</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Two substractions, one multiplication and one addition. ;)<br />
<br />
Yes you are right, it's easier... if you are planning to use that for delta-times (differences between two times).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">1st March 2003, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">So what is the actual script for converting GetFileTime high and low dwords into readable hours and minutes?<br />

Well, it's more or less in the archive :p The title is &quot;report elapsed time at the end&quot; or something like this. <br />
<br />
Anyway, to get seconds from that double number (as I said before) you only need to divide by 10000000.<br />
<br />
If you still need the code here it is:<br />
GetTempFileName $R5<br />
GetFileTime $R5 $R6 $R7<br />
IntOp $R7 $R7 / 10000000This three lines are copied and pasted from that script :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have just used the plugin instead...<br />
<br />
http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/imker/afrowuk/downloads/nsisdt.zip<br />
<br />
This plugin dll allows you to enter like 15 different combinations of dates and/or times into your app.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to Rainwater for writing the plugin :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">1st March 2003, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">But I beleave that have a bug in this NSISdt:<br />
<br />
oct/28 until feb/08 - show -1 hour (i.e. 01/01/2003 00:30 show 31/12/2002 23:30 !). <br />
<br />
mar/7 until oct/20 - show +1 hour (i.e. 04/30/2003 23:30 show 05/01/2003 00:30 !).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd March 2003, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that's because the function called in NSISdt is taking the day light saving time into consideration.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">2nd March 2003, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">-1 or +1 hour of original time. In my computer for example the clock is showing now 14:29, now the NSISdt show normal (we are between feb/8 and mar/7), but after mar/7 will show +1 hour of original time (the time here will not to be in the summer time!), after oct/20 will show the original time, and after oct/28 will show -1 hour (when the time here will be in the summer time). Now it's more explained, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

In fact I've found a small bug in this code example - $CMDLINE may return for installer.exe name in double quotes, or with some parameters, so I've changed scripts a bit (Could Kichik or some one else update CVS version please ;). See bellow for script which works fine for me at win98/xp (you should first update sysfunc.nsh from attached zip). Reply if you'll have more problems, please.<br />
