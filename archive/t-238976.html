<br />
Recently I've translated some plug-ins to my native language (Portuguese from Portugal) and I'm concerned with some issues and I have some questions to ask.<br />
<br />
1. Legal issues: Is it legal to provide a patch to add a translation to a plug-in without modify it's coding? (In this case a Patch created by Restorator)<br />
<br />
2. Where can I make my suggestions for that NullSoft plug-ins that cannot be fully translated?<br />
<br />
3. Is there anyone who can provide me a NSIS script which has the feature to select the patch you want to install in the Winamp plugins directory. You know, I'm really a newbie at NSIS...<br />
<br />
TIA for any help!</div></div><hr />

Hi kichik,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply but I think I didn't explained myself correctly. The suggestions I was thinking of, were to Winamp plug-ins not to NSIS.<br />
<br />
The plug-ins that you are talking about (distributed under zlib licemse) are for Winamp or for NSIS?<br />
<br />
PS: I just didn't understand why this thread have been moved to here when the main questions are related to Winamp...</div></div><hr />

<br />
topic should be moved to Winamp forums.</div></div><hr />

PS: I just didn't understand why this thread have been moved to here when the main questions are related to Winamp... Because you mixed two completely different topics. Open a new thread about your plug-ins question in the appropriate forum and keep this thread for the NSIS questions.</div></div><hr />
