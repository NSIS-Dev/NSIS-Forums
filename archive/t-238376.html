<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PaulFoz</div><div class="date">18th February 2006, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to come up with a way of installing sound files and text files onto an iPod from a download.<br />
<br />
To get more of an idea of what I mean check out the free download at http://www.talkingpanda.com/ilingo.php I would like to emulate this if possible.<br />
<br />
Can NSIS do this and if so where should I start?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />

The first question would be, how does the information get to the iPod?  Can you just copy files over to it like you would an external hard drive?  Or does the sent info have to filter through Apple's own programming interface?<br />
<br />
Unfortunatley, I've not been able to find much about this.  Seems Apple wants the user to use their own software for the most part.  (The link you included in your original posts seems to indicate that ilingo uses some type of programming interface to get the info to the ipod.)  <br />
<br />
You may want to start by searching through  Apple's dev site (http://developer.apple.com/) to try to find the answers.<br />
<br />
The only thing I managed to find some useful info regarding the use of 'notes' at http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ipod/ipodnotereader.pdf<br />
<br />
If you can determine how to get the info to the ipod, I'm sure someone here can offer more suggestions on how to accomplish your task using NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 'notes' feature is exactly where some of the files need to go. To place them here manually it is merely a case of 'click and drag'. The sound files however need to be placed into the iTunes library.<br />
<br />
So what the installer would need to do is:<br />
 <br />
1. Check that the iPod is connected and enabled for disk use.<br />
2. Place a seris of text files in to the notes folder on the iPod.<br />
3. Open up iTunes and place a seris of sound files into the iTunes library.<br />
<br />
You can see the whole procedure on the  'Installation' page on my website www.coolgorilla.com<br />
<br />
Any more advice please????</div></div><hr />

Is there a plugin that could check for the location/existance of an iPod?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dandaman32</div><div class="date">20th February 2006, 06:41</div></div><div class="posttext">You could probably use an IfFileExists check to look for the &quot;Notes&quot; folder on every drive.  I'm not sure how to do a loop and increment the var by 1 letter (e. g. make a loop that starts at letter C and the next time the letter's D and so on and so forth)<br />

<br />
Each ipod has a folder called &quot;ipod_control&quot; which would identify it as an iPod. Is there some way to utilse this in order to create a FilePath that would work?</div></div><hr />
