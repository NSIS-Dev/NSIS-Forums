<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoscoBilly</div><div class="date">24th July 2009, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.<br />
I am using the GetMacAddr sample provided by Brainsucker.<br />
Getting the IP_ADAPTER_INFO structure vars the way he did it works fine - thanks Brainsucker!<br />
However, I am trying to get a string var in that struct that needs to be accessed by pointer.<br />
here are two lines: the 1st is the working stuff with my attempt to get the pointer I need; the 2nd is my non-working atempt to retrieve the value of that pointer that I need.<br />
<br />
System::Call '*$4(i.r4,i,&amp;t260.r5, &amp;t132.r6, i.r7, l.r8,,,,,*i R1)'<br />
<br />
System::Call '$R1-&gt;IpAddressList.IpAddress.String(t R2)'<br />
<br />
At the end of the first line, var R1 is a pointer.<br />
In the 2nd line, I try to get the string - it returns nothing.<br />
Could someone pl explain what I am doing wrong here?<br />
Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoscoBilly</div><div class="date">25th July 2009, 02:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I altered the prior code due to some errors.<br />
The element I was trying to access is a struct, not ptr.<br />
here is the new code:<br />
<br />
First call is working code form Brainsucker<br />
System::Call '*$4(i.r4,i,&amp;t260.r5, &amp;t132.r6, i.r7, l.r8,,,,i.R1)' # r1 is Struct IP_ADDR_STRING<br />
<br />
This call is to get 2nd struct from R1<br />
System::Call &quot;*$R1(,i.R2)&quot;         #R1 is Struct IP_ADDR_STRING  with 5 members -- <br />
<br />
This call crashes - it should get final 1-element struct from R2<br />
  ; System::Call &quot;*$R2(t.R3)&quot;             # R2 is struct IP_ADDR_STRING with 1 member<br />
<br />
The 3rd Call returns nothing.<br />
I have been all over the System plugin doc and cannot figger out this one.<br />
Anyone done this b4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoscoBilly</div><div class="date">25th July 2009, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">With the original Brainsucker code, it will only get first adapter.<br />
<br />
I run C++ code in my app which uses this very same call and I have no problems with it on test machines that this code will:<br />
1) only show 1 adapter when there are 5.<br />
2) will not rtn IPAddress.<br />
<br />
Is there someone who can help me with these problems?</div></div><hr />

I did not have a debugger handy to analyze the memory layout of the IP_ADAPTER_INFO structure in detail. So there might be potential pitfalls.<br />

Your IP part is the right way to do it, despite that struct chain that seemed to require multiple CALLs with *!Rx.<br />
The final struct in the IPAdressList chain has 1 element, which is the IP. It is a 16 byte array, just as you allocated for.<br />
<br />
As I said in my post, in my app , I get 5 MACs on this machine using GetAdapterInfo.<br />
This script only returns 1, which happens to be the one with the correct IP in it!<br />
My plan was not to get the IP this way, but to loop thru the MACs, as I do in my app, comparing IPs to get the matching MAC.<br />
Given that, I wonder how reliable this script will be?<br />
It works on my XP pro Sp2 and W2003 server R2 machines.<br />
It would be nice of Brainsucker could jump in here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">f0rt</div><div class="date">26th July 2009, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be helpful for further analysis to get a memory dump of the pAdapterInfo parameter after the return from GetAdaptersInfo.<br />
<br />
I would suggest to use the example provided by Microsoft http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365917%28VS.85%29.aspx as a basis and insert code to dump the memory of pAdapterInfo in the while loop.<br />
The value of ulOutBufLen would also be of interest because the NSIS script uses a maximum buffer of 4096.</div></div><hr />
