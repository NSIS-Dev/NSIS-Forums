<br />
I want to make a installer with one big file. The size of data more then 4GB. But NSIS can do file only &lt;2GB now.<br />
<br />
I try installer based on zip file. But its size more 4GB. When I try open file .zip I get &quot;Error openning zip file&quot;. What kind error - I don't know.<br />
<br />
Can I create one file installer with size more then 4GB? How do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Basically there is no good solution currently for installing large files. I ended up distributing a small installer together with a set of .tbz2 files and using the 'untgz' plugin to decompress the files: the 'untgz' plugin was the only one that I found that could handle files that were larger than 4GB.<br />
<br />
If your individual files are smaller than 2GB then you can compress them into individual zip files (so long as no zip file holds more than 2GB of data you're OK). Then there are various unzip plugins which will work. However, there's no solution that will let you distribute a single &gt;4GB installer.</div></div><hr />
