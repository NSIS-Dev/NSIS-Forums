<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">essemar</div><div class="date">21st March 2006, 06:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This is similar to a previous post (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=240319&amp;highlight=nsis+error).  I seem to be having the same sort of problem.<br />
<br />
I keep getting the following error on many different files I've tried to install:<br />
<br />
&lt;quote&gt;<br />
NSIS Error<br />
<br />
The installer you are trying to use is corrupted or incomplete. Thes could be the result of a damaged disk, a failed download or a virus.<br />
<br />
You may want to contact the author of this installer to obtain a new copy.<br />
<br />
It may be possible to skip this check using the /NCRC command line switch (NOT RECOMMENTED).<br />
&lt;/quote&gt;<br />
<br />
The first time it happened was trying to install the latest version of Azureus. I downloaded an older version, which installed fine, had it auto-update, and that worked.<br />
<br />
The next was rarx. I can't remember how I got it to eventually install, but I did finally get it to work.<br />
<br />
I've gotten this error trying to install new drivers for my Philips Shoqbox.<br />
<br />
Most recently, and frustratingly, I get this error with DefilerPak and vlc. (I can listen to my .avi files, but I want to watch them too.) <br />
<br />
Every file I download, I scan with Avast(hey, it's free) to make sure it's virus free, so it shouldn't be that. The first couple times this happened, I was willing to believer there was some sort of corruption somewhere, even when I tried downloading the file multiple times from multiple mirrors.<br />
<br />
Now it's getting to the point where I think there must be something wrong with how my 'puter interacts with NSIS files.  I ran a Kaspersky virus scan (from their website) in addition to my Avast.  All clean.  I ran Microsoft Antispyware and found nothing.  Finally, I ran chkdsk.  No problems there.<br />
<br />
Could it be some sort of decompression issue?  When I was trying to install Defiler and got the above error message with the self-executable, I tried downloading a .zip version of the installer.  When I used the windows 'extract all' command on it, I got this error:<br />
<br />
&lt;quote&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt;Compressed (zipped) Folders Error&lt;/title&gt;<br />
<br />
Error reading the file<br />
&lt;/quote&gt;<br />
<br />
Once again, same problem from multiple downloads and multiple mirrors.  Also, I just uncompressed a large batch of files I had archived with no troubles.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this problem, but I've tried a few other places, and no one seems to have any advice beyond what I've already tried.<br />
<br />
Any of you have any ideas?<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

The installer you are trying to use is corrupted or incomplete. Thes could be the result of a damaged disk, a failed download or a virus.<br />
<br />
Chances of Azureus installer was corrupted during uploading, downloading, even virus by the developer are also pretty high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">essemar</div><div class="date">21st March 2006, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, if it had only been Azureus, I wouldn't have worried about it.  It's when it started being a consistant error that I started to think something was wrong.<br />
<br />
I downloaded MemTest, and I've been running it for about an hour now with no errors found.  I'll go ahead and let it run for a few days just to make sure, but it doesn't look like a memory problem.  Thanks for the tip Rob.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have any ideas?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I have had a few download corruptions in the past and this little program prevents corrupting the file during download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">essemar</div><div class="date">22nd March 2006, 04:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny thing Jason.  I tried downloading the download manager manager you suggested, but when I tried to install it, I got an error message:<br />
<br />
&quot;The setup files are corrupted.  Please obtain a new copy of the program.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it uses NSIS like every other piece of software that has an installation procedure.  I tried downloading a couple times from the site.  I couldn't find any mirrors, and I couldn't find older versions available for download, so I wasn't able to try those.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I think there is something weird going on with winxp that is making it so it won't play nice with NSIS.  Does this sound at all plausible?  I don't know how it interacts with the OS.  I still think it's some issue with how NSIS compresses/decompresses the data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">22nd March 2006, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you scanned for viruses?<br />
If so, what antivirus software do you have installed?<br />
<br />
This has happened in the past where antivirus software has falsely detected a virus in an NSIS installer and 'repaired' the executable making it corrupt.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea: Download and install NSIS from the nightly build Zip: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip<br />
Run NSIS\makensisw.exe and open one of the example scripts in the NSIS\Examples folder. Then click Test Installer. If the same error occurs then my assumptions would be correct.<br />

I tried it out, and it said that everything worked fine.  No errors.  I guess I was just having bad luck or there's some weird corruption somewhere in my OS.  I've been thinking about reinstalling winxp anyways, so if the problem persists and gets annoying enough, I'll just do that.<br />

I scanned for virii and malware and the like, did a chkdsk, and the whole shebang. Still get the error on all downloaded install packages.<br />

When I switch to downloading from MSIE, everything is FINE.<br />
<br />
How does this NSIS script interpreter function exactly? Does every PC have it installed or something? I downloaded the nightly build and I still get this problem but, again, only from Firefox (v1.5.0.1).<br />

I don't know what's going on, and I was pretty shocked when using IE made everything A OK.<br />
<br />
I did submit a bug report to Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/), and you probably should too.  Someone else there has experienced the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th March 2006, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">No PC has anything like NSIS interpreter installed. All NSIS installers are completely self-contained. In fact, as essemar has shown, it doesn't happen only with NSIS. Everything he downloaded was corrupted, including ZIP files and Inno Setup installers.<br />
<br />
I really doubt this is a Firefox bug. I use Firefox and I've never had a corrupted download. It might be a problem with your connection, a bad Firefox extension or some program running in the background and interrupting, maybe even a bad driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kafka47</div><div class="date">25th March 2006, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply, kich... obviously, I have no idea if its Firefox per se. If its systemic as you suggest (eg. bad driver, bad connection) then that would affect MSIE as well, wouldn't it? <br />
<br />
Also note that my entire install is absolutely pristine - brand new hardware across the board that passes every test I give it. The only observation that I have is that downloads work 100% in MSIE, and near zero percent in FF (including NSIS installers, zipfiles and the like).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th March 2006, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it could be something that only happens with Firefox and a driver, or a transparent-proxy on your ISP which acts weirdly with Firefox. But I seriously doubt such a noticeable problem with Firefox on its own goes undetected for so long by so many.</div></div><hr />

You're probably correct in pointing out a compatibility issue between FF and something else. Likely not anything ISP side, as I have FF on other PCs in my house.<br />

In my experience about firefox. If you used an extension called &quot;Down Them All&quot;  to download an execute file then you might got an broken execute file.  So I droped it. I suggest you download it by other download manager, like Flashgot.</div></div><hr />

I had disabled it immediately on setting up my system, but even in the disabled state it was still doing *something*. Once I removed this piece of crap everything returned to normal.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I did use Avast - but only after I had started seeing the problem.<br />
<br />
I'm going to give feedback to nVidia on this issue. Their NIC driver suite includes some pretty bizarre stuff (including an integrated CLI) and most of it is totally shoddy. Stick to graphics, nVidia, lol. :)<br />

<br />
http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp<br />
<br />
that is a RAM tester and is very simple to use. Heck I will even explain in simple steps so you dont have to read as much info.<br />
<br />
1. Download the program<br />
2. Open program and insert a 3.5 floppy into your disk drive<br />
3. save to the disk and to desktop incase =)<br />
4. turn off your pc<br />
5. take out all of your RAM but 1 stick and restart<br />
6. select first boot device as 3.5 floppy on your CMOS<br />
7. (make sure your disk is in the 3.5 drive) let it run the program. You will see the RAM test run through a series of 6 tests if it says &quot;successful&quot; your good to go. If it says failure there's your problem.<br />
8. hit &quot;X&quot; and turn off your pc. Use another stick of RAM and repeat step 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't tell you how many things I have tried from the windows installer updates to manually running /NSIS it took but that did it and I hope it works for you.<br />

My personal tip: Try to download the file at someone else place, e.g. on a USB Stick or SD card and try a reinstall on your machine. Somtimes in VERY rare cases the memory of your PC is defect or not set up correct (to fast) in your BIOS.<br />

Sorry to say but this is not an ideal forum location for your question. This is a NSIS Developer and script creator forum.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, see the link above.<br />
<br />
My personal tip: Try to download the file at someone else place, e.g. on a USB Stick or SD card and try a reinstall on your machine. Somtimes in VERY rare cases the memory of your PC is defect or not set up correct (to fast) in your BIOS.<br />
<br />
Good luck  <br />
<br />
Yah sorry about that it's just this is the most developed thread I found on this issue and I already tried everything on the sourceforge and still no luck though one thing is weird when I install my ethernet driver theres no option to install a firewall or not it just tells me to automatically find the driver from the device manager and it automatically installs when it finds the driver installer.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try to do the USB stick thing and before there was this blue screen error but seeing as I couldn't find the system recovery command option on the windows setup disc for the life of me I just completely wiped and reinstalled windows (I needed to anyhow). Maybe this is the problem? If so how do I fix this? Should I try following the rules to fix the blue screen error and see if that fixes it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaroja</div><div class="date">10th April 2008, 06:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I stumbled across this site in my frustrated search for a solution to this very annoying problem I am having. I sure hope that someone here can help me figure out what to do to fix this!! <br />
My problem is extremely frequent NSIS error stating that the installer is corrupt or incomplete. <br />
I bought this new computer in Feb this year, it is a Dell with Vista Home Premium. Recently I have been having this error message come up about 80% of the time when I try to download any sort of program. This happens with BOTH IE and FF and also using Download Accelerator and NOT using it. I am so frustrated, I have been trying to get AVG free anti-spyware on this computer. I was successful in getting the AVG anti-virus, but have been trying off and on for a couple days to download the antispyware, but I continually get the corrupt installer message. <br />
I have done antivirus scans and come clean. I have an NVIDIA graphics card, but not a NIC that I know of (I am not that great with computers, but I can usually figure things out given enough time searching for answers). I also download things using Azureus and utorrent and I do not have any problems with any of my downloads using those programs.<br />
I did succcessfully download the Free Download Manager and install it, and I am trying right now to download the AVG antispyware. Ok, that finished and the same dang thing happens!! I am so very frustrated with this and dont have clue what to do to fix this problem!! <br />
I would be so very grateful for any help that anyone might be able to provide. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

this problem seems to be with most setup programs, run on my computer. i am using windows 7 ultimate, and running the installs as administrator. all my temp directories have full access to Everyone. there are three groups of them, 3 in documents &amp; settings, 2 in users, and 1 in the windows directory.<br />
any help or advice to find out what to do, would be greatly appreciated. i would especially appreciate a solution, or even just some steps i might have missed to get me closer to a solution!<br />
sincerely,<br />
Pierre &quot;Greywacke&quot; du Toit</div></div><hr />

this problem [NSIS Error: Error writing temporary file. Make sure your temp folder is valid.] seems to be with most setup programs, run on my computer.<br />
<br />
One thing I see recurring on The InterWebs is that perhaps your TEMP/TMP environment variables are broken.. e.g. the variables are non-existing, the paths don't exist, etc.<br />
So that might be worth something to check.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greywacke</div><div class="date">2nd October 2010, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">hi animaether,<br />
unfortunately i checked this both with SET and through the system properties... why i recreated the directories that were defined where they did not exist...<br />
still no results though. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greywacke</div><div class="date">2nd October 2010, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">oh on extra thought, the permissions for the folders...<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\Temp<br />
Everyone - full permissions cept special<br />
Authenticated Users - all permissions cept full control and special<br />
SYSTEM - full permissions cept special<br />
Administrators - full permisions cept special<br />
Users (Read &amp; Execute, List folder contents &amp; Read permissions<br />
Read-only (Only applies to files in folder)<br />
<br />
C:\Users\%MYUSERNAME%\Local Settings\Temp<br />
Everyone - full permissions cept special<br />
 Authenticated Users - all permissions cept full control and special<br />
 SYSTEM - full permissions cept special<br />
 Administrators - full permisions cept special<br />
 Users (Read &amp; Execute, List folder contents &amp; Read permissions<br />
 Read-only (Only applies to files in folder)<br />
<br />
C:\Users\%MYUSERNAME%\AppData\Temp<br />
Everyone - full permissions cept special<br />
 Authenticated Users - all permissions cept full control and special<br />
 SYSTEM - full permissions cept special<br />
 Administrators - full permisions cept special<br />
 Users (Read &amp; Execute, List folder contents &amp; Read permissions<br />

<br />
are there more that should be created? or are these sufficient.<br />
<br />
the environmental variables on system advanced are:<br />
<br />
TEMP<br />
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp<br />
<br />
TMP<br />
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">3rd October 2010, 02:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I got nothin' then - I stay away from those crazy permissions things (Users without write access to temp? what? &gt;_&lt;).. but one thing you could try to help pinpoint what might be going wrong is firing up Process Monitor (Sysinternals - hit google) and log all the file/registry i/o the installer is trying to perform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greywacke</div><div class="date">3rd October 2010, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah well for some reasons the permissions were stuffed. so i formatted the c drive and reinstalled. just reset permissions on the d drive, which is used for documents.<br />
issue resolved!</div></div><hr />
