I am still not to understand clearly about NullSoft. When I read help file. I can not see why +2 or +3 except (+1 or +0)  :(<br />
I also find information about it but I still can not.<br />
StrCmp $0 &quot;a string&quot; 0 +3<br />
  DetailPrint '$$0 == &quot;a string&quot;'<br />
  Goto +2<br />
  DetailPrint '$$0 != &quot;a string&quot;'<br />
Someone can help me???<br />

I don't clearly understand you. Do you need more information about jumping to labels or what? What is wrong with +1, +0, +2, +3. <br />
<br />
If you need advice in conditional logic, have a look at LogicLib.nsh and the examples in the NSIS/Examples directory - LogicLib.nsi. It is more clear to beginners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean relative jupms? :confused: It's all in the NSIS Manual (4.4 Relative Jumps) read also (4.3 Labels) I personally like to use labels instead of relative jumps, but it's not always possible.<br />
<br />
Basically the +integer or -integer tells the program to jump on instruction relative to the place they are called from.<br />
StrCmp $0 &quot;a string&quot; 0 +3 ; if register $0 == &quot;a string&quot; jump to 0 (continue normally) <br />
else jump to the third instruction from this point (skip the DetailPrint and Goto below).<br />
<br />
DetailPrint '$$0 == &quot;a string&quot;' ; if the jump was 0 the code will continue normally here.<br />
<br />
Goto +2 ; jump to second instruction from this point (skip the DetailPrint)<br />
<br />
DetailPrint '$$0 != &quot;a string&quot;' ; if the jump was +3 the code will continue from this point</div></div><hr />

My problem is not to understand clearly many command on NSIS. Sometimes, I read on help file, I can not find it out.<br />
I want to find another example which it is more clearly to study it.<br />
So, I want to ask everybody to have more documents.<br />
Once again, thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saschagottfried</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">search for files with nsi extension in your NSIS installation directories and you will find tons of examples. They are grouped to a certain topic or subject. If you read just some of them you will understand a lot. <br />
<br />
Nobody can help you understanding NSIS, unless you have some experience. Compile examples, see what they are doing and look in the code. <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
