Internal compiler error #12345: error mmapping datablock to 855985079.<br />
<br />
Note: you may have one or two (large) stale temporary file(s)<br />
left in your temporary directory (Generally this only happens on Windows 9x).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It should work without it. Virtual memory is good enough for it. Maybe your swap file is too small. According to the error you were trying to make an installer larger than 850MB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you by any chance using FAT16/32 and not NTFS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AnalogKid</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The maximum file size on a:<br />
<br />
   * FAT16 partition under Windows 9.x and ME is 2 GB.<br />
   * FAT16 partition Under WinNT or 2K is 4 GB<br />
   * FAT32 partition under any OS is 4 GB. <br />
   * NTFS partition is ~16 exabytes or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes (2^64 sectors). I don't think we'll be whining about that limit any time soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mark_Ive</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">i am also having the same problem but i know what the resolution to mine is even if you are outputting to a different drive my c: has to have enough space for the same size as the installer is going to be...<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to move the location the temp files nsis uses as i cannot free up enough space on c: to compile please help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS uses the system temporary directory. All you need to do is change it. You must also have a NTFS drive if you want to compile very big installers (800+ MB).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mark_Ive</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Was just about to reply i worked around the problem by changing my environment variable tmp and temp paths to my bigger drives as you said this works fine now<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AnalogKid</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh .. as far as the NTFS drive requirement goes, it didn't do anything for me to make them NTFS. I still run into the same problem, but I haven't had time to run through the code and figure out where. Do you have any ideas? Also, has anyone heard from Thetotoman to see if his predicament was fixed by this (or even if he was in fact using FAT)? <br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

Btw I still appreciate the work you guys do on NSIS, altough I'm not using it very often these days (thinking back to those good ol' days). :up: :D Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slloyd</div><div class="date">30th October 2008, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">With OS, memory, and hard drives getting larger I was wondering if you have plans to increase the 2GB setup limit?<br />
<br />
We provide installs (web downloads) for large companies and there are times that I have to zip up the install instead of providing a nullsoft setup.exe<br />
<br />
Today, I had to build a single install that was 2.2GB. Of course, nullsoft failed and I had to use CopyFiles and zip up the install using WinZip instead.</div></div><hr />
