I don't know about NSIS-N.I.C.E. Last time I have heard from the author he was moving to another programming language. I hope he is still working on it.<br />
<br />
I guess all of the others, SlateBlue, WorkBench and friends are pretty much dead because no one has updated them for more than a couple of months (correct me if I am wrong here, I would love to hear about GUIs under development).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there any demand for bringing Slate Blue back?<br />
<br />
peace.</div></div><hr />

Well, it is nice to have something like that for NSIS2...</div></div><hr />
