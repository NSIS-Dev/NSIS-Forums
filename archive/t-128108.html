<br />
I'm trying to make several installers in one.<br />
To explain: I have a Winamp3 component which is installed in a dir that has changed in alot of the Wa3 builds.<br />
Both the path, and the filenames of the files I install (to clarify here, it's the Poppler Replacement I'm talking about, so it's installed in the Pledit folder, somewhere in Wacs/xml...... :)).<br />
<br />
I'm now trying to make the installer have support for any Winamp3 build by, depending the section choosed, installing to different dirs and installing different files.<br />
<br />
so far so good, but the installer is where things get interesting, or not.<br />
<br />
I cannot make the uninstaller change it's workingdir and the files it should remove depending the install section selected..<br />
<br />
I could probably use the registry for this, but I then have to write huge amount of &quot;if... then..&quot; code.<br />
like: if path=blablabla then uninstall this...<br />
<br />
There gotta be a better way to do this..??<br />

on &quot;un.onInit&quot; read those components...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plague</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm, I think I'd rather go with the registry then..<br />
Isn't it possible to somehow transfer the data from the section selected to the uninstall section?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">.onSelChange is not useful. It's better to check the situation during the installation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plague</div><div class="date">12th March 2003, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, we'll see how it goes.<br />
I might do the whole thing in another way and if so, then I won't need this anyway..<br />
It all depends a little if what I have planned will work or not..<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway.<br />
