<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cakira</div><div class="date">11th May 2005, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello!<br />
<br />
I created a script for installing a program and, based in a Modern UI example (I don't remember the filename), I configured it to create a shortcut in the StartMenu. The installer creates it with no problems.<br />
<br />
But, after uninstalling the program, I still find an entry in the registry. The entry is:<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MenuOrder\Start Menu2\Programas\Tomodachi<br />
<br />
Where &quot;Tomodachi&quot; is my application's name.<br />
<br />
I've seem no reference to it in the manuals and I think it's name is different under Win98 and I think this entry is duplicated somewhere else in the registry...<br />
<br />
Can I delete these registers? Should I delete them? How can I delete them?<br />
<br />
Just for reference, I'll put below the pieces of my script that seems related to the startmenu.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />

If you want to delete those items I think you have to kill explorer since it probably writes them out on exit.<br />
In my own installers I dont remove this item, but it should go away if the user does a &quot;Sort by name&quot; in the folder containing your item (Programs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MichaelFlya</div><div class="date">11th May 2005, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to be How Windows Saves your Order for your Folders of<br />
the Start Menu... It only Appears after you install your Program<br />
and only Appears Once you have Opened that Programs Menu<br />
Folder.<br />
<br />
Anyways it Doesn't Seem to be a Problem However if you want<br />
to Remove it Just include this Line. Under your Other Will Work.<br />
Like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
DeleteRegKey /ifempty HKCU &quot;Software\Tomodachi&quot;<br />
<br />
DeleteRegKey HKCU &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MenuOrder\Start Menu2\Programas\Tomodachi&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That will Delete it and anything Else you have Under it.<br />
<br />
After looking at it's Path I have Programs under that Section I <br />
haven't Had Installed for Months... So The only way to Delete<br />
it is to do it by Hand or By Getting your Installer  or Uninstaller<br />
to Delete it.<br />
<br />
The Only Difference was &quot;Programas&quot; was Spelled &quot;Programs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Spanish Windows.. heh...<br />

<br />
I've just tried. I reordered the menu, &quot;shutdowned&quot; windows, reordered the menu again, manually mixed the menu order and reordered the menu once again. The register was aways still there.<br />

<br />
So it seems...<br />
<br />
But making the Uninstaller to delete it doesn't look to be that simple because I've seem that this path is slightly different under Win 98. And as I said Win XP (and perhaps Win 98) duplicates this entry under \HKEY_USERS\some_weird_numbers\Software\.......<br />
<br />
Well, I don't understand windows registry, so I think the best aproach is: &quot;If it works, DON'T TOUCH&quot;. I mean, I'll left it as it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Only Deference was &quot;Programas&quot; was Spelled &quot;Programs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Spanish Windows.. heh...<br />
 <br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Portuguese Windows, English names in the register and fingers that keep spelling in Portuguese even against my will   :-)<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you again!<br />
