<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankiebonez</div><div class="date">4th November 2003, 02:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm building an installer for some quake mods and I'd also really like to have the ability to resume downloads.  I saw that mceo (mahmut) was doing something for his school and there was a question as to the reliability/performance of the resume download mod made to the NSISDL plugin.  Has anyone developed a better download resume capability for NSIS?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankiebonez</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. it seems that no one cares about resume... so could someone just help me compile one of the versions of NSISDL that supports it (found here http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=77177&amp;highlight=resume+download)<br />
<br />
I downloaded a C/C++ compiler and tried to assemble the DLL but I don't know almost any C code (only C I did was inside a development environment and it was weird C) or anything about compilers (see previous reason).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest you save yourself the trouble, skip compiling and simply use curl, wget, or any other downloader that supports resuming, if resuming is so important to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankiebonez</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">well the goal is to keep the installer exceptionally small.  Is wget included in everything back to Win95?  What about Curl?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">None of them are included with any version of Windows. Both are external, free and open-source tools available for download on the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankiebonez</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">curl is about 250k, the installer approaches 300k.  I still think it would be easier to use the resume version of NSISdl -- I just need a compiled version of it (or help compiling it) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Enjoy.<br />

The code he wrote is based on an old version of NSISdl so it contains bugs that have already been fixed and doesn't containt new features that have been added. A list of those changes can be found at:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankiebonez</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the dll!  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to actually download anything :( when called.  It acts like it's about to do it, but nothing really happens.  So I'm not so sure what's going along.<br />
<br />
I'm going to continue to play with it and see if I can get it to work, but since then I think maybe too much has changed for everything to work together properly.<br />
<br />
If all else fails I may just have to figure out how to adopt curl and deal with a larger installer.  C'est la vie.</div></div><hr />
