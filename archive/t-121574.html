<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benoni</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know how I can find out the root dir of all local drives on a machine.  It would be best if it returned one at a time in the format (c:\) in a variable and then you add 1 to another variable send it to the top again and it would do the second one - or something like that.<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't find anything in the system DLL that would work - which bit of it were you meaning.<br />
<br />
<br />
The DriveInfo plugin by KiCHiK might be of interest to you, get it on this page: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/download.php<br />
<br />
That works the other way around - or am I wrong.  I thought you gave it a drive letter and it gave you info about it.<br />
<br />
I was looking for something like the 'Enumerate cd drives' polugin which worked for F.D.Ds.  H.D.Ds.  C.Ds.  D.V.Ds.  Zip Drives etc.</div></div><hr />

You always seem to enjoy pointing them out, I can't help but wonder why? The CVS and other recent versions of NSIS are development versions which *will* contain bugs, that's exactly why they are not proper release versions. Instead of jumping up and down when you spot a bug why don't you join the team of people who try to make NSIS better so that a proper release can be more quickly achieved?</div></div><hr />

I don't!:mad: (at least, I think I don't ;))<br />

I can't. I don't know C or C++.:cry:<br />
But I could be a good beta-tester. (At least, I think so ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd February 2003, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">OK... After our nice speculations about bugs, lets move on to actually work this out...<br />
<br />
Benoni, the script you have provided can't possibly work on NSIS 1.9. I think you are talking about MakeNSISw 1.9. Open up MakeNSISw again and look at the bottom left corner of the screen. Are you using NSIS 2.0b0 or the latest CVS version (2.0b1)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benoni</div><div class="date">2nd February 2003, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I should upgrade:winamp:? :( :confused: :down: :igor: <br />
Is there a newsletter which informs about new versions?  I have been a bad boy:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd February 2003, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know yet. First tell me what version you are using. The version you provided earlier was of MakeNSISw. It is another program that comes with NSIS, but it's not the compiler itself. The scripts you've tried won't even compile on NSIS 1.9. Open MakeNSISw.exe again and look in the bottom left corner. What does it say? What version are you using?<br />
<br />
To keep updated about releases sign up to SourceForge, go to the project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/) and click the little envlope icon in the NSIS 2 Pre-release line (or click here (http://sourceforge.net/project/filemodule_monitor.php?filemodule_id=58746)). It will send you an e-mail whenever a pre-release version is released. To be updated as possible use the CVS version (see the FAQ for that).<br />
<br />
I have looked at it again and it seems the problem is with your Windows version. I don't know a lot about 95 versions so I can't tell anything from the version number you gave us, so I'll have to ask you. Are you using a Windows 95 version that came before OSR2? MSDN says GetDiskFreeSpaceEx (which is used in System.nsi) only works on Windows 95 OSR2 and above.<br />
<br />
This shouldn't matter to you much because you don't need the free space count anyway so you can just remove this line and all the calculations that come after it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benoni</div><div class="date">2nd February 2003, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">2.0b0<br />
I thought I had put that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd February 2003, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, you put 1.9... Never mind :)<br />
<br />
You also said earlier that:<br />
System::Call '${sysGetDiskFreeSpaceEx}(i r1, .r3, .r4, .r5)'<br />
<br />
Worked for you, so you must be using post OSR2. I don't know a lot about System.dll. I will message the creator (brainsucker) and see if he can help you.</div></div><hr />

It worked ok, except when I included one or both of the lines with the # before them.  Then I would get the same 'This program has performed an illegal opperation and will be shut down.' error message</div></div><hr />
