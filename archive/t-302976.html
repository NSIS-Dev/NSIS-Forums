I'm basically having the same problem as the thread at that URL using NSIS 2.37.<br />
<br />
1. Install a very large set of files and folders using the normal File command.<br />
2. Uninstall *most* of the files but *not all*. Leave a couple of folders with a couple of files on the disk (e.g., Web.config and other configuration files). In fact, I had to write my own .NET code that I call from the uninstaller that reads the Uninstall.dat file generated by AdvUninstLog. AdvUninstLog itself was far too slow for any large set of files and folders. I use AdvUninstLog to generate the Uninstall.dat file during install.<br />
3. Run the same installer again and choose the same target folder.<br />
<br />
Apparently whatever NSIS is doing when the screen displays &quot;Searching in:&quot; is not very efficient. This problem is causing the re-install to go from far less than a minute in length to 8-10 minutes in length.<br />
<br />
Since the problem appears to be with NSIS itself and not any script I can debug or modify, I am at a loss as to how to tackle this problem.</div></div><hr />
