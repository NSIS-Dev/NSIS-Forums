<br />
I have just updated to the latest NSIS 2.37 from the 2.25 version and the unpacking dialog doesn't display anymore after the language selection. I didn't see anything on the changelog  that mention anything related to this issue. I'm still using the old Modern UI, would that have something to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">25th June 2008, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you shouldn't see the &quot;unpacking&quot; banner at all, if your installer is created correctly. Maybe you use plugins or extract files in your .onInit function that have not been reserved via ReserveFile at the top of your script? If you do it correctly, the installer will startup immediately, without &quot;unpacking&quot; delay. Only CRC check may take some time for really large installers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guglielmo</div><div class="date">25th June 2008, 04:45</div></div><div class="posttext">uhm...ok there maybe some file not properly reserved but my question is why I see the unpacking dialog when compiling the installer with NSIS 2.25 and I don't see it when using NSIS 2.37? With NSIS 2.37, I don't see the dialog but I can tell that something is happening because the hour glass.<br />
Any idea??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">25th June 2008, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Again: If I'm not mistaken, there should be no delay at all, which makes a &quot;unpacking&quot; dialog unnecessary. I saw that sometimes in the past, but I could avoid it by using the ReserveFile instruction. Maybe it's your A/V software that causes the delay while scanning the installer?</div></div><hr />
