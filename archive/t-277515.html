<br />
I am trying to give users of my installer 2 options of how to use the installer based on how much control they want. What I want is for my second page of the installer (after the intro page) to ask the user if they want to do an easy install or an advanced install. When advanced install is selected I want the installer to carry on as it does now, going through several pages before the actual install page, but when the easy install option is selected I want it to jump straight to the installation page and not hassle the user with the other pages. Does anyone know how to specify that the installer should only present certain pages depending on the route through the installer chosen from a previous page? Also to make a page where the user can choose either 'advanced' or 'easy' will I have to make a custom page or is there a page provided that can be used?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much in advance!<br />
<br />

You can use a global variable to store the &quot;mode&quot;, and just skip over the other pages in the pre callback function for a page, or jump directly with http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Go_to_a_NSIS_page (depending on if you actually need each page to load to get some default data or not)</div></div><hr />
