Begins annd opens a new section. If section_name is empty, omitted, or begins with a -, then it is a required section and the user will not see it, nor have the option of disabling it. If the section name is 'Uninstall', then it is a special Uninstall Section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">yes i know this but i WANT the entry in there (crazy idea mybe) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prodangle</div><div class="date">18th October 2001, 00:49</div></div><div class="posttext">If you only have these 2 sections, you could make the 2nd one a hidden section, and also make a third empty section, with the name of the 2nd section, and make EnabledBitmap and DisabledBitmap both point to the enabled bitmap icon.  This would make it appear to the user that none of the sections could be disabled, as the size also wouldn't change with the 3rd section being empty.  It wouldn't work if you had any other sections besides these you did want to make optional.<br />
<br />
I know this is a bit of a messy way to do it, but I don't know of any other way.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of some use :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">18th October 2001, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmh ok this may help at the moment<br />

required = yes <br />

<br />
