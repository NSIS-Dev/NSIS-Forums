<br />
I'm looking for a way to get other controls on forms using the ModernUI, either at design time (with extra things in the .ini file), or at run-time (by using the system plugin to call the right api to add them).<br />
<br />
In particular, I was wanting the adobe/macromedia flash control on my form, or alternatively some html browser/rendering engine.  I know those are probably the hardest controls to support, but they would allow the greatest flexibility for the user.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, I'm wanting some way to show a slide show during installation, however due to NSIS not supporting effective multithreading this is hard.  For example, I want to be able to show my slide show at the same time as extracting a large file, and the slides must be able to change during the extraction.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
