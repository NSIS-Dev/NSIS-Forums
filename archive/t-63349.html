<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n_ick2000</div><div class="date">22nd October 2001, 05:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used the StateBlue NSIS GUI version 0.025 and I didn't like it too much because some features didn't work right for me. Anyway, I decided to make my own NSIS GUI. So, What do you think of it. It has some features that the StateBlue version 0.025 doesn't have.<br />
<br />
By the way, I think you might need the VB6 runtimes for it. They can be downloaded  here (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp4/win98/EN-US/VBRun60sp4.exe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">23rd October 2001, 02:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Nick, I tried to run your program, but after the splash screen, it crashes out with this message:Run-Time error '339'<br />
Component 'COMDLG32.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid<br />
<br />
I don't think it is my system, because it's WinME, I made sure I had the VB6 runtimes, and I have all the updates from Windows Update, and I haven't had any problems running other VB software.<br />
<br />
If you want, we can trade beta's and test each other's software.  I'm working on a winampdb-like win32 program.  PM me if you're interested.  An early verion of the program is in my sig.  The executable might not work, but the source is included.<br />

Extract the comdlg32.ocx in this (http://www.megasecurity.org/Needed_files/Comdlg32.zip) zip file to the system directory. <br />
<br />
By the way, I fixed a coupple bug in my nsis gui. Here is the newest version. I hope it works now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n_ick2000</div><div class="date">23rd October 2001, 05:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a link to all of the vb6 runtimes so if you don't want to download the all the runtime files just run this (http://www.wolfiesden.com/downloads/files/vb6run12031999.exe) exe file. Drawback is that it is about 3.5 mb. Haven't tested it tho. Good luck with my NSIS GUI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">23rd October 2001, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the 3.5meg installer and then ran your latest (0.1.2).  It works now, and, while I might not be the biggest fan of wizards, it looks nice and I'll probably use it as a &quot;starter&quot; kit for my nsis scripts from now on.  If I run into any problems as I'm testing it out, I'll let you know.<br />
<br />
Don't take my lack of enthusiasm about wizards as a critisism towards your program, Microsoft soured Wizards for me.  Your program is pretty well laid out.  I might have a few questions for you, though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">23rd October 2001, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i really cannot express the anger i feel right now, seeing the opening screen of your program badmouth mine. (slate blue).<br />
<br />
but anyway, maybe we should collaborate on slate blue to make it better, in your way of thinking.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n_ick2000</div><div class="date">23rd October 2001, 23:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't trying to badmouth you. I used the stateblue version 0.025. At the time I was new to NSIS, so alot of it confused me. I noticed that some features like backgound gradents didn't work for me, so that's all I ment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">24th October 2001, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">i now realize that (moment of anger).<br />
<br />
but my offer still stands, would you like to join the &quot;team&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n_ick2000</div><div class="date">25th October 2001, 00:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to join your team, but I'm not sure I'm good enough looking at your latest screen shots. If you really want me, PM me the details. Just remember that I know very little c++ (just basic dos-like stuff). I mainly use vb for visual stuff. Just remember that I don't really think I'm good enough.<br />
<br />
BTW, new version of my NSIS GUI. Fixed a few minor typographical errors and added start menu creation. For the record, I don't really feel like a competor to you. I have both nsis gui's and encourage everybody else to do the same.</div></div><hr />

This sounds cool, but I really don't know. I will rate it and let you know where it will be placed. Other than that, It is great to have the community up and rather revived!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">25th October 2001, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">i think you are onto a usefull app, what i would like to see is it integrated with slateblue... so you run slateblue and it would have a wizard button you run through that app (cleaned up visually) and when finished you have the option to send info back to slateblue, or save to script, or to compile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">25th October 2001, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">i totally agree; one of my most faithful users has suggested something like winzip, where you can choose the wizard interface (n_ick2000's gui), or the classic (slate blue).  if we combined these, it would be the ultimate gui :)<br />
<br />
plus, mine doesn't even require the makensis.exe to compile :)<br />
<br />
i hope we can get started soon,</div></div><hr />

I would be honored to have this put in the NSIS Project House.</div></div><hr />

liquidmotion an ultimate gui would be the right thing for everybody (i think).:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">trace:  n_ick2000's gui and slate blue have officially been combined.  i have rewritten and visually cleaned up his wizard, and added it to slate blue as the wizard creator.  you can still use regular slate blue for creating more advanced scripts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">that`s great, where can i find the Ultimate GUI??? i`ve searched your page (http://www.morphedmedia.com) but there are only old versions... i have a lot of ideas in my mind for slateblue. so if the app will be ready let me know, i`ll write you some goodies :D, bye for now... trace :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Slate Blue on CNET (http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-10091-100-7690810.html?tag=st.dl.10001-103-1.lst-7-1.7690810)<br />
<br />
This is (I think) the most current version.  He probably hasn't updated the site to reflect the latest version, yet.  I'm guessing it because he's been so busy with the program ;)<br />
<br />
-=Gonzotek=-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Slate Blue on CNET Download.com (http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-10091-100-7690810.html?tag=st.dl.10001-103-1.lst-7-1.7690810) is the most current version.  it does not include the wizard, as it is the last in the old line of my gui.  the cnet download includes source code.<br />
<br />
the new version, to be released before dec. 15, does contain the wizard, and an updated interface.  this release is a total rewrite, which allowed me to release the old source code.<br />
<br />
the page hasn't been updated since, as Gonzotek stated, I've been working hard on the program.  i will try to work on the site tonight, but my magic eight ball says &quot;outlook is doubtful&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lion King</div><div class="date">4th November 2001, 05:03</div></div><div class="posttext">slate blue doesn't start, it gives me an 'unexpected error'<br />
<br />
i have copied the depency files into windows/system directory<br />
<br />
the same happens with the winamp3 skin tool from the wa3 forum which is also written in vb<br />
<br />
i have win98se without ie<br />
<br />
any ideas? an unexpected error could be everything<br />
could you maybe list all system files that sb depends on?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lion King</div><div class="date">4th November 2001, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">aaahhh, that worked!<br />
<br />
some of these installers without version checking must have overwritten those files<br />

thanks trace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">4th November 2001, 23:40</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the help trace! :)<br />
sorry Lion King, didn't mean to crash your comp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lion King</div><div class="date">5th November 2001, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">only your prog crashed, not windows<br />
<br />
anyway i don't like that it covers my taskbar and it gives me a runtime error '5' (invalid process call or invalid argument) on exit<br />
<br />
but that doesn't matter since you say in the readme that the next version is a complete rewrite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">9th November 2001, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">yes the v1.0 doesn't cover the titlebar, will not crash on exit, and is fully sizable.<br />
<br />
it also includes a much better layout and better coding.<br />
<br />
sorry for crashing :)</div></div><hr />
