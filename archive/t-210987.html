<br />
<br />
I have been working on NSIS for the past one week and found it very useful. Writing PHP sort of code for every page u want for Installer is also nice but time-consuming.<br />
<br />
I did not find much help from &quot;Windows Help File&quot; supplied with NSIS regarding &quot;Creating Custom Pages&quot;. Help File need to be elaborated more and the Examples too.<br />
<br />
By the way, I am thinking of shifting from NSIS to IzPack. if somebody has earlier worked on IzPack, tell me which it cant do....<br />
<br />
Note: All I want is to install Tables on a Remote Oracle. i.e. I need to run SQL Files on Remote Computer(may be using Telnet or may be using someother simple technique).<br />
<br />
<br />
Bye<br />
<br />
<br />

&quot;IzPack is an installers generator for the Java platform. It produces lightweight installers that can be run on any operating system where a Java virtual machine is available.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talk about light-weight :-)<br />

<br />
Even NSIS is &quot;light weight&quot;. it has a foot print of just 32KB.<br />
<br />
I think, the main difference is NSIS uses &quot;PHP-like language&quot; whereas IzPack uses &quot;ANT-like Scripts&quot; i.e. XML Files.</div></div><hr />

LOL???<br />
i'd call it rather batch-like or asm-like.<br />
it has nothing to do with php (except the var-symbol $).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">24th March 2005, 01:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The NSIS script language is inspired from a lot of other script/batch languages. You can't just say it draws it's structures from one other particular design.<br />
<br />
I like NSIS because it's so generic in it's form. You can do just about anything if you use your imagination.<br />
The plugin architecture is great but not unique to NSIS.<br />
InstallShield always had support for plugins to be used in extending the installer with new pages and setup routines.<br />
The most typical plugin used within InstallShield installers is a CD-Key/Product key verification plugin.<br />
InstallShield also had support for device driver installation at a very early stage something NSIS is lacking support for. You can make an NSIS installer which installs a device driver by making it execute a .INF file but that again uses Windows INF script engine to to the work (i'm not sure what it's really called).<br />
<br />
If you're going to run SQL queries you may write a plugin tailored for that task but that again requires the knowledge of languages like C, C++ and/or Delphi.</div></div><hr />
