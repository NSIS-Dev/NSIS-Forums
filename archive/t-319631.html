<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tumtum</div><div class="date">2nd June 2010, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am new to the powerful NSIS installer program and am having a few problems creating an installer for a product.  I would like to add a background picture to replace the standard blue computer with an arrow pointing at it.  I am also trying to replace the icon in the top left corner of the installer with my company logo.  I have looked for hours on the NSIS wiki page and have fiddled with the script according to the tutorials that I have found, but none of them seem to work to the desired effect or at all.  If someone could take the time to write a step-by-step walkthrough of the process, then I would be tremendously thankful, but I realize you are all busy people with lives, so any help I could get would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Specifically..<br />
for the image top-left, that's called the header, see:<br />
!define MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP bmp_file<br />
<br />
The bigger image on the left is the WELCOME/FINISH page bitmap, see:<br />
!define MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP bmp_file</div></div><hr />
