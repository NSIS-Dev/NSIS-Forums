<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dantemw</div><div class="date">12th April 2007, 00:27</div></div><div class="posttext">At the end of an NSIS install there seems to be a cleanup phase that deletes DLLs used by the installer such as &quot;nsExec.dll&quot; and &quot;System.dll&quot;. However if one of these DLLs is in use at the time of delete it gets marked for delete on Reboot.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to modify this cleanup behavior to either:<br />
1. Not delete on reboot<br />
2. Be invoked by calling into the installer with a command-line rather than automatically happening at the end of the script?<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dantemw</div><div class="date">12th April 2007, 00:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevermind. I discovered that it was the NSISArray DLL that was marked for delete on reboot. I just added:<br />
Function .onGUIEnd<br />
    NSISArray::Unload<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
And all is well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sometimes i ask also stupid questions where i know the <br />
answer after a couple of minutes while try&amp;error or reading <br />
over and over the faq.<br />
<br />
well - idd - i made same error with nsisarray - the key<br />
for reboots is in registry and called &quot;pending operations&quot;<br />
i have my own tool to clear those mistakes.</div></div><hr />
