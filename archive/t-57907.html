<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m1000</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm looking into using this program and need to know if there's a way of ask the user for information, for example, what's their username.  My ultimate goal is to use this information to populate an ini file.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sixty4bit</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The only current answer to this is &quot;Make your own.&quot;  NSIS provides a nice framework to load files, make registry edits and put it all in one small package that is easy to create.  If you want more than that, then add it yourself.  I had this very same question and currently use a Perl script to meet the needs.  If I knew VB, then more than likely I would have used that so I would have a nice front end.  It isn't Install Shield, but then, you don't have to pay $6k for it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m1000</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I'm still pretty uncomfortable with this installer still so I'll hold off until I at least make one install.  <br />
<br />
Any chance I can look at your code?  Did you make a subroutine within the script file?  Asking for that information?  How does it look when a person runs the install?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sixty4bit</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 23:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the ExecWait call:<br />
ExecWait '&quot;getUserInfo.exe&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\config.ini&quot; &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$1&quot;'<br />
<br />
and then delete the program afterwards.  $0 and $1 are registry settings that got copied into those variables earlier and the config.ini is the file that needs to be updated by the Perl script that was turned into an exe.  It pops up a command prompt type window and asks for other information to put into the config.ini file and then exits.  If everything went ok then the installer is done.</div></div><hr />
