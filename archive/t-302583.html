<br />
I am new to install system world. I am evaluation 2 options for my software's installer. NSIS and Microsoft's Install Shield. My requirements are very basic:<br />
<br />
- Registry entries for XP and Vista 32/64 bit platforms.<br />
- File system driver installation.<br />
- Making installations for other than Windows OS.<br />
<br />
I know 3rd one is not possible in both. But if there is any option known, please let me know. <br />
<br />
Considering above requirements, what all seems to be a good option for me, considering I am new to this install system world. Will NSIS scripting be worth doind for above requirements than wizard based InstallShield. If yes, then what advantages t has.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
InstallShield is a commercial product, which is developed and sold by Acresso Software.<br />
It uses Microsoft's &quot;Windows Installer&quot; in addition to it's own install engine, but that's it.<br />
<br />
Problem with InstallShield:<br />
Even the very basic &quot;Express Edition&quot; costs you ~550 â‚¬, which is far too much for such a simple product.<br />
So if you want to do anything useful (comparable to NSIS or InnoSetup) you need to get the &quot;Professional&quot; version.<br />
And that Pro version of InstallShield costs you ~2500 $, while NSIS is OpenSource and 100% free...<br />
<br />
Another thing: NSIS uses LZMA compression, which is far superior to the compression used by InstallShield.<br />
Many vendors create their installers with InstallShiled, but wrap an NSIS installer around it for better compression.<br />
<br />
The only reason for InstallShiled is that it's establish in the &quot;commercial&quot; world for years now...</div></div><hr />
