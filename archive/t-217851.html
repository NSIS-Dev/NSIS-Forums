<br />
As mentioned in title I am using the Modern UI and have been able to successfully get 1 link to work. I would like to add a second link to the same finish page but can't figure out how. Here is what I have so far to get the first one to work:<br />
<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_LINK &quot;Home page&quot;<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_LINK_LOCATION &quot;http://www.test.com&quot;<br />
<br />
This then shows up as a checkbox on the 'All Finished Installing' screen as an option below 'Lauch Program'. I would like to add another link that leads to my forums.<br />
<br />
TIA for any help.</div></div><hr />

I think the space will be accepted as a space between two links (not sure). I haven't tried this but it might work.</div></div><hr />

Is there a way to do it in NSIS 2.0b? The link you pasted seems to only be for 2.08 and I tried installing it, and ended up having to basically rewrite my entire installer, and gave up because I have to re-learn everything I already fought with the first time around. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">23rd August 2005, 04:15</div></div><div class="posttext">By the looks of this, 'it' probably means NSIS. NSIS went through some major chages during the development of 2.0.  I suggest you upgrade to 2.08 via nightly build here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip) (as the one on the nsis site has a bug - RMDir won't delete $INSTDIR).<br />
<br />
Sorry, it is possible but the function is called before the dialog is initialised which means we can't set the background colour of the link to white. When you call init_dialog, the handle of the dialog is pushed onto the stack. init_dialog is called after the pre function in MUI so there is nothing I can do for now. <br />
<br />
I would like Joost to move the pre function to just before the dialog is shown so we can set the colours manually if we want to. The dialog handle MUI_HWND would be useful for setting the colours.</div></div><hr />
