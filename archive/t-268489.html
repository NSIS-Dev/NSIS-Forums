<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">empezar</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this problem like 1-2 years ago when trying to add a polish translation to my installer.<br />
<br />
I'm having difficulties saving the text file. If I use ANSI, all the special characters are converted to their latin counterparts. If I use UTF-8 or Unicode, the installer will not compile, generating this error message:<br />
<br />
Invalid command: Ã¾Ã¿<br />
!include: error in script: &quot;fquake-lang-polish.nsi&quot; on line 1<br />
<br />
Is there any way of being able to copy/paste a Polish translation into a text file and actually being able to use it? Or must I ask my Polish translator to send me a .txt file created on his computer every time he makes changes? This is not a very smooth way of updating translations for my project :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on your editor. Some don't do too many conversions on their own and a simply copy &amp; paste works. The best way is to get a complete text file from the translator. But I usually find Notepad works just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">empezar</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess your computer must be enabled to displaying Polish text. I can't even see the Polish special letters inside the installer. However, the Polish translator can see them just fine and tells me the Polish translation is working great.<br />
<br />
I'm not getting why I can't see certain language special files with my Windows.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the Polish characters, but when I copy them, the bytes stay the same and that's all that matters.</div></div><hr />
