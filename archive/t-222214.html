<br />
I've been busy doing other things, and decided to update from 2.01 to 2.07. After doing this I can no longer run one of my scripts, since the Variable that is being concatonated is being truncated, therefore, making my command line call too short.<br />
<br />
It's basically an NSIS app that calls makensis.exe with all the desired variables defined. I did it this way to best support certain multilingual features, which couldn't be modified otherwise. I keep appending to my $Defs variable which easily could exceed 1024 characters in length.<br />
<br />
I know I could make multiple variables and link them etc etc, but that is a pita. I also know I could write it out to a file then run the file. I'd like to keep it as is.<br />
<br />
What changed, and when will it be fixed?</div></div><hr />
