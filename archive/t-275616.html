First it puts up the Nag box that this is an &quot;Unidentified Program&quot; and you need to click &quot;Allow&quot; the install.  Then, after the install, only sometimes, Vista will say that the program might not have installed correctly and should be reinstalled with the proper configuration settings.  You need to say it did install correctly or click on the Reinstall with proper settings (nothing different) and let it do it again.  Then Vista is happy.<br />
<br />
The installer does not write any registry keys. It only extracts files.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<br />
I'm pretty sure this part is an NTFS thing.  If the file was copied from an unidentified source, it will pop up that message when a user tries to execute it.   <br />
<br />
For example, if you download an installer from the web using Internet Explorer to a local NTFS drive, a setting is put on that file that says it's an unidentified program.  So when you double click on it, you get that dialog box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a UAC function in vista, and there was a similar warning for files downloaded with IE in XP SP2. <br />
<br />
You can avoid the non-descript yellow box if you code sign your installer. So instead of a yellow warning that says &quot;Unidentified Program&quot;, it will instead be a more subtle color and say &quot;YourProgramName from YourCompanyName needs elevated privileges.<br />
<br />
A code signing certificate cost anywhere from $90 to $400 depending on who you buy from.<br />

Sure, but when XP goes the way of Windows 98 and all of your users switch to Vista and beyond, you're stuck with unprofessional looking software and installers.</div></div><hr />
