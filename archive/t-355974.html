<br />
(Sorry for poor English... )<br />
Lately, I was reported that my NSIS program has a problem with accessibility by a person related Human Rights Commission.<br />
<br />
The problem was a accessibility program could not confirm whether the Components Page's checkbox option was checked or not.<br />
<br />
Basically Windows 8's Narrator program supports these function, so I was able to checked those problems, too.<br />
<br />
Anyone who solve these problems tell me what I have to do. <br />
THX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">18th February 2013, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The component treeview uses images because:<br />
A) Older versions of Windows does not support checkboxes in the treeview (IIRC)<br />
B) The versions with checkbox support does not support all the states we use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lignuz</div><div class="date">19th February 2013, 03:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the Checkbox in the treeview is just a image, so it can't be told by the external programs, you said. <br />
<br />
There is no way that I should think. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I really appreciate your kind answer. :-)</div></div><hr />
