<br />
# name the installer<br />
outFile &quot;installer.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
# default section start; every NSIS script has at least one section.<br />
section<br />
<br />
# default section end<br />
sectionEnd<br />
--------<br />
<br />
For testing purposes, I have created the .nis file in this directory:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\LS\NSIS_Script_Editor<br />
<br />
The NSIS Script Editor log ends with these 2 lines:<br />
<br />
!define &quot;MUI_INSERT_NSISCONF&quot; = &quot;&quot;<br />
Can't open script &quot;C\Program&quot;<br />
<br />
I have read various things about that first line, but still I must ask, What am I lacking?</div></div><hr />

OutFile &quot;installer.exe&quot;<br />

MessageBox MB_Ok|MB_topmost &quot;A car! pluft Where!? pluft&quot;<br />

The results are exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Can't open script &quot;C:\Program&quot;<br />

I would greatly appreciate any further assistance here.  Obviously there is a simple something that I am not understanding, and it's like having the door to NSIS barred.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&gt;Try creating the .nis file in a DOS style path: &quot;C:\Test\X.nsi&quot; (no spaces) If you run the file from the run box (window+R), will fail if not in DOS style.<br />
C:\Program indicates that the path has ended.<br />
<br />
&gt;If the program is running, there is also an error. Press Ctrl Alt Del before compiling to verify.<br />
&gt;NSIS is properly installed? (you've not copied the entire path to other, do you?)<br />
&gt;Are you using nsisedit? (very good editor)<br />
&gt;Some kind of antivirus?<br />
&gt;Ran scandisk ? - this happens when there is an error on hd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">22nd July 2006, 06:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, Mark.  I loaded your script into MAKENSISW and tested the installer, and it's perfect.<br />
<br />
So why am I not able to compile and execute in NSIS Script Editor?  It seems to me that it is related to the editor using MAKENSIS rather than MAKENSISW ?  I paid $25 to download that editor and can't get it to compile and run the installer.<br />
<br />
There must be something else I'm not understanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mark Nascimento</div><div class="date">22nd July 2006, 07:16</div></div><div class="posttext">GoTo http://hmne.sourceforge.net/<br />
or (the two lines below are only one link, one line)<br />
&quot;http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hmne/nisedit2.0.3.exe?download&quot;<br />
<br />
It&quot;s free. Edit, correct misstypes, compiles and execute.<br />
There is only a little bug on find/replace all. <br />
I don't know about your editor. Sorry.<br />
Here it goes: One tomato screamed to his friend:<br />
- A Car !<br />
pluft**$#@<br />
And the other goes:<br />
- Where ?!<br />
pluft**$#@<br />
Programming can't be boring. Be patient with nsis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">22nd July 2006, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I got ripped off when I bought the editor from Labour-Saving Software Labs.  Their product is called NSIS Script Editor.  With that product, I have not yet succeeded in compiling the script, nor does the Help menu item work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like a long filename problem to me. Try accessing the script with 8+3-names instead. You know, those that look like &quot;C:\PROGRA~1\yada\yada\script.nsi&quot;.<br />
<br />
Or, create your test directory in a path that contains no spaces.<br />
<br />
