thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">13th October 2001, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">also, i'm wondering if justin frankel has taken the time to check out my work on the gui, and his opinion (probly &quot; dont use visual basic, you're a lamer&quot; etc :))<br />
<br />
if you can let me know mr. frankel, it'd be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pomflain</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 05:45</div></div><div class="posttext">What I mean is this something like an IDE wherein you'll have quick access to the function prototypes and it will aid in the &quot;writing&quot; of the script,  or are you planning something like the rather evil MFC where the gui will &quot;believe&quot; that it can do things in a better fashion than you can do on your own?<br />
<br />
(I.E. if I let WORD tell me how to write that sentence it would be split up into about 5 sentences...hehehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 05:57</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it is an IDE, but it is written in VB. It looks great (even better than I can do with a C++ editor). <br />
<br />
liquidmotion:<br />
I am starting an FAQ/Tutorial section on NSISPH. I would like for you to write an FAQ or Tutorial for SB. That way, when people download it, they will have something to read.<br />

P.s. 400 POSTS!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah SB is great, but the IDE idea is good too. SB has a script window, unfortunately uneditable, but if it will be editable it`ll be good make something, that when you write one or two first characters of a function name, some function prototypes will apear in some window. so if user has short memory he will saw what functions exists and what for parameters they need... like in M$ Visual C++, you type for ex.: &quot;Beg&quot; you press Ctrl-Space (autocomplete) and some little window apears with all functions... when you write the full function name like: &quot;BeginPaint(&quot; then apears another tooltip window or what with required parameters... it`ll be great, don`t you think???<br />
<br />
and sorry for my bad english...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repzilon</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Something like M$ Intellisense would be rather long to program. I'm am not sure that someone would like to put a lot of time in that project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 01:11</div></div><div class="posttext">i have turn SB into an IDE like VC++ or VB, complete with MDI forms (windows that control other windows).  the script textbox is now its own window, as is pretty much everything else.  much easier to use than the original SB.<br />
<br />
once i have most/all the bugs worked out, i will post a link to download.<br />
<br />
i will begin writing the tutorial after this major version change is finished! :)<br />
<br />
l8a,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah that would be great... did you do that on my request, that in the script window is long code total disarrayed??? and will be the script window editable??? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 23:07</div></div><div class="posttext">script window will be editable if you go into &quot;manual edit&quot; mode.  when you leave &quot;manual edit&quot; mode the code layout window is updated to your changes.<br />

take a look.<br />
<br />
new beta soon (i hope),</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spanky</div><div class="date">16th October 2001, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen a screenshot of SlateBlue and I must say.. it's looks pretty nice.<br />
But I wouldn't use it.  The NSIS script commands are easy enough to understand without the use of aids.<br />
<br />
But for any &quot;NSIS newbie&quot; this is a nice tool.  Keep up the good work!  :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">16th October 2001, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">...yes the NSIS script commands are easy and you can make installer in notepad or in some other this-kind program. But SlateBlue is better `coz you have all in one. you see what functions exists, what for parameters they need and so on... the pic looks good :), and if it would be possible to make for script window &quot;font setup&quot;, because code with constant width is better to read... bye :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 00:10</div></div><div class="posttext">what font should i have as the default? currently it is &quot;Arial&quot;, but if that is hard to read I should definitely change it.<br />
<br />
any other changes/ideas?<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repzilon</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The monospace TrueType font installed on all computers running Windows is &quot;Courier New&quot;. But you have some fonts of the Lucida family, Andale Mono and OCR A Extended that are monospace. Monospace fonts are better to show code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">courier font is good and its ttf version courier new is also good but worser. when you want some changes/ideas: some windows for example the properties-window are unnecessary big... it takes whole screen, and it`ll be good to make some windows dockable for ex. function/instructions or properties window. i will think about some other ideas... bye for now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">18th October 2001, 04:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I always liked Veranda and Ariel. Heck, it would be cool to choose our own fonts, User Specified, catch my drift????<br />
