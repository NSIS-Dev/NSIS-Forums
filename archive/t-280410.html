Is there a way of detecting if the file is different to when it was installed? So if a customer modifies one of the originally installed files it is left?<br />
<br />
Our customers sometimes use the provided examples as a starting block for their own and I don't want to delete their work. I've got it so it doesn't delete the directory if their are still files in there (new files), but if they modify a file then it won't be detected that it has changed.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to place a screen where it asks if the user wants to delete the APPDATA directory in modern UI like I've seen in some uninstallers or do I need to do it as a custom page?<br />
<br />
With Thanks, Graham.</div></div><hr />
