<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AaronLS</div><div class="date">4th March 2008, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">When writing a reusable macro, I was looking at how to preserve and restore reguisters.  <br />
<br />
The DotNET macro on the wiki has this at the beginning:<br />
<br />
Push $0<br />
  Push $1<br />
  Push $2<br />
  Push $3<br />
  Push $4<br />
  Push $5<br />
  Push $6 ;backup of intsalled ver<br />
  Push $7 ;backup of DoNetReqVer<br />
<br />
And this at the end:<br />
<br />
  Pop $0<br />
  Pop $1<br />
  Pop $2<br />
  Pop $3<br />
  Pop $4<br />
  Pop $5<br />
  Pop $6 ;backup of intsalled ver<br />
  Pop $7 ;backup of DoNetReqVer<br />
<br />
Wouldn't this restore the registers completely transposed?<br />
<br />
I was looking at the LogicLib.nsh, and it seems a lot more readable.  I was wondering about how this works:<br />
<br />
  !macro _== _a _b _t _f<br />
    StrCmp `${_a}` `${_b}` `${_t}` `${_f}`<br />
  !macroend<br />
<br />
What would happen if I already had a _a defined in my script?  Or if I tried to define _a after using that macro?  Would there be a conflict?<br />
<br />
Is there special meaning to the leading underscore, or is that just to minimize the chance of a conflict?<br />
<br />
I like the idea of just prefixing defines with the name of the script file.  Kind of like a namespace.</div></div><hr />

It switches all of the variables after the macro call and doesn't properly restores them. $0 will be $7, $1 will be $6 and so on. I've fixed the Wiki page.<br />
<br />
As for LogicLib, macro's definitions override global definitions so it doesn't have a problem with an existing definition named _a.</div></div><hr />
