<br />
For some days, I have some problems using the changelog from the dev web site !<br />
In fact, when clicking on links, now, tha displayed file tells me no changes occured on the file !<br />
Would it be possible to correct this &quot;bug&quot; (i'm using that feature a lot) ?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Julien</div></div><hr />

The only think would be to search what's wrong now ;) :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand why you found problems, for me is working fine.<br />
<br />
good luck,<br />
Ramon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not working on the most recent changes, older ones still work fine. This was my experience last night when using the change log page anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramon18</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the last changelog entry was updated yesterday 22:00 GMT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">On this page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/changelog.php) try clicking InstallerOptions.cpp (http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/nsis/NSIS/Contrib/InstallOptions/InstallerOptions.cpp.diff?r1=1.62&amp;r2=1.63) under the heading &quot;2003-06-16 18:49 Ramon (ramon18)&quot; and see if you see what my screenshot shows.<br />
<br />
In fact I've just noticed that the testlink.ini and testlink.nsi file links are broken too, although differently. E.g. the testlink.ini link takes me to a page that says &quot;/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/nsis/NSIS/Contrib/InstallOptions/testlink.ini: unknown location&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramon18</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You right :(<br />
<br />
But this is a problem in cvs browsing/diffing system and not changelog<br />
<br />
cyas,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh agreed, but it's still a problem.<br />
<br />
There's a message on the sf.net status page about changes to cvs access due to hardware limitations which might be the cause of this problem.<br />
<br />
(  2003-06-13 08:17:23 - Project CVS Services   )   The SourceForge.net team is aware of the continued performance issues afflicting project CVS services. While a portion of the work needed to alleviate these issues has been completed, we are currently waiting for the implementation of new hardware to complete this work; this is expected to occur in the month of August. In the mean time, the following steps will be taken by SourceForge.net staff: developer (SSH) CVS access will not be changed; pserver-based CVS access from the project shell servers (i.e. from cron jobs) will not be changed, but the overall cap of pserver connections from the shell will be lowered to a more reasonable level; pserver-based CVS access from external hosts (i.e. not the project shell server) will be served against the backup CVS server, which contains data roughly 24 hours older than that on the primary CVS server; ViewCVS access will be provided using the backup CVS server (data shown by ViewCVS may be older than the current data in the repository). These changes will be transparent to users and will not require any configuration changes on your part. These measures are temporary and will be removed pending the successful completion of our work to improve performance on the primary CVS server. It is our expectation that offloading ViewCVS services and pserver-based CVS access to the backup CVS server will bring developer CVS performance back to a reasonable level. Should you have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please contact the SourceForge.net team by submitting a Support Request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right. Public CVS / Browse CVS access has a delay of up to 24 hours, because it runs on the backup CVS server.<br />
<br />
The changelog is being generated from the development server, so it displays the latest changes that do not yet exist on the backup server.<br />
<br />
So you might not be able to see the differences of files uploaded less than 24 hours ago.<br />
<br />
We'll have to deal with this situation for a few weeks, until SourceForge gets new hardware.</div></div><hr />
