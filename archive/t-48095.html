<br />
First off, this is a continuation from another thread, but the topic doesn't fit on that one any more as this is a seperate problem, so I hope it's ok me opening a new thread!<br />
<br />
In 1.3 I had a problem getting Jump to go over a SetOutDir command if that command was followed by a File /r &quot;&lt;files&gt;&quot; command. I was hoping all the Jump -&gt; Goto changes in 1.4 would have fixed this, but it still seems to be a problem:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath c:\temp2\ExamTesting1<br />
  Goto LabelPastSetOuts<br />
  SetOutPath c:\temp2\ExamTesting2<br />
  SetOutPath c:\temp2\ExamTesting3<br />
  LabelPastSetOuts:<br />
  File &quot;C:\temp3\file1.txt&quot;<br />
  ;File /r &quot;C:\temp3\*.*&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
The code as it stands works fine, with file1.txt being placed in the \ExamTesting1 directory. If I comment out the first File command and uncomment the recursive file command, it goes a bit strange. The files in c:\temp3 are placed in \ExamTesting1 as before. Then the subdirectory in temp3 is created, but for some reason it is created in \ExamTesting3, which should have been jumped over.<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm only doing an installer for a single file so I can work around this, but any help or info on this would be great!</div></div><hr />
