<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spilly</div><div class="date">28th August 2007, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys,<br />
I've been noticing that very occasionally (3-5 times per 30) on vista when I launch installer1 from the command line and use the SetSilent method in the installer it will throw a &quot;NSIS Error Launching Installer&quot; when I execute installer2 from inside installer1(that uses SilenInstall). Installer1 installs properly, but installer2 doesn't launch.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if installer1 is set to SilentInstall, I've ran it 120+ times with no sign of the error from installer2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question: How does SilentInstall and SetSilent differ from each other and does NSIS handle them differently? Also, Why would this only occur on vista(I've set the RequestLevel correctly in both installers)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please include a complete example that can be used to reproduce this issue.</div></div><hr />
