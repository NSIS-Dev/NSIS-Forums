<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sag47</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a cool installer that checks and requires NSIS to be installed before proceeding.  If it's not installed then it will download NSIS from SourceForge and then install it.  <br />
<br />
Then it checks for HM NIS Edit (Detects HM NIS Edit) and then recommends it but if the user doesn't want it installed then it will just proceed.  If the user wants it installed then it will download HM NIS Edit from SourceForge and then install it.  It will also download/install the Fabio Function plugin which I find to be helpful because you can simply press Ctrl+G and it will pop up a dialog that will allow you to jump to any section or function in the script.  Once the HM NIS plugin is installed it will associate HM NIS Edit with NSIS script files (.nsh/.nsi).<br />
<br />
After both of those are installed it will download 2 plugins from the NSIS wiki.  They are zip files.  Once the plugins are downloaded it will extract the zip files and install the plugins into NSIS.<br />
<br />
The plugins gotten are:<br />
    ScrollLicense<br />
    ZipDLL<br />
<br />
Two very helpful plugins for installing.  This is a nice script if your friends want to install NSIS.  Rather than taking an hour to explain to them how to get it it will do it automatically for them with no hassle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sag47</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">What could it possibly go under in the Wiki?<br />
<br />
I guess the NSISdl plugin or the ZipDLL plugin.<br />
<br />
Am I allowed to post it in both?  I read the user agreement when signing up for this and it said double posts in different categories are not allowed.<br />
<br />
What's the policy on the Wiki?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Those plugins are already posted up there. Post your code only and add links to the related software that you use. Probably under real world installers? See other pages to figure how to deal with wiki. The very first time it seems hard. Don't give up! After a few rounds would be very easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is just the standard warning about forum cross-posting, (i.e posting the same thing to multiple winamp forums, such as Winamp Discussion, Winamp Tech support, etc etc)</div></div><hr />
