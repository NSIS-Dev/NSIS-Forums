<br />
I am trying to write an uninstaller for a program that has a service that runs all the time.  Iâ€™ve tried using a few different plugins and I can get the service to stop.  But usually it takes the operating system (Windows XP / Vista) a while before it realizes that the service is stopped and releases the files that the service uses so I can delete them.  Anybody know how to get the operating system to refresh the running processes list?  Or any other suggestions to my problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

You should include a counter (IntOp)  and you should Abort the install when the counter has reached a certain value (${If}/StrCmp) so that it does not loop forever.<br />
