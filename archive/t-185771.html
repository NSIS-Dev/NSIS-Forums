<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marqo</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!<br />
My installer is composed of 9 installer, one for each of my sections. That means that I call &quot;InstallerSection1.exe&quot; if the section 1is choosen, etc. <br />
And &quot;InstallerSectionX.exe&quot; contains files, and the main installer only contains some &quot;InstallerSectionX.exe&quot; files.<br />
My probleme is this one: when I call &quot;InstallerSectionX.exe&quot;<br />
with<br />
nsExec::Exec &quot;$TEMP\${InstallerSectionFile}&quot; /S /D=$INSTDIR<br />
<br />
nothing appears in the log windows (Page instfiles) of the main installer...<br />
I try a lot of solutions but nothing convinced me. I wouldn't like opening another windows for an internal installer, just get the log in the main installer.<br />
<br />
Is it possible ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">AfrowUK wrote a function to put the log from the instfiles Page into a file, so you could <br />
<br />
-put the log into the file<br />
-read the file into a variable<br />
-delete the file<br />
-print the content with &quot;detailprint&quot;<br />
 in your main installer<br />
<br />
I hope you understand what I mean<br />
and that it fits to your needs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marqo</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you. Yes it could be a way, but if one of the internal installers need 2 minutes to install, nothing appears in the window during that time and users could think that install operation crash... with your method, I doesn't solve the problem. I really need to obtain log &quot;as it comes&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">what about writing a detailprint ala &quot;installing files, this may take a few minutes&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marqo</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it could be too... but... not exactly what I would... <br />
<br />
Is it possible ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">nsExec::ExecToLog displays output in the log window &quot;as it comes&quot;.<br />
<br />
For more information see the nsExec.txt file in the Contrib\nsExec folder (the folder also contains a simple script which uses nsExec::ExecToLog).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marqo</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, but ExecToLog give you the possibilites to log a dos command, or a program that run in dos mode (as makensis). You cannot log a windows program, as an exe you made with makensis/makensisw. I am wrong ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I only glanced at the rest of the thread.<br />
<br />
Why are you using separate EXE files for each section in the installer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marqo</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it's suite of products. Each products could be installed alone, but the most of merket is the suite. There a lot of advantage, the first is that you can make a complete installer (with all &quot;InstallerSectionX.exe&quot; included), and with the same nsi you can make another one wich contains only code, and the &quot;InstallerSectionX.exe&quot; are downloaded :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not do it the normal way with the seperate sections containing the seperate files. If you have loads of files, and you want to break it up in the script, put the sections in different files and then !include the files.<br />
<br />
I didn't write the dumplog function, that was written by Kichik for me :)<br />
I wrote the other one though which dumps only lines containing a certain string.<br />
