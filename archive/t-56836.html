<br />
But that last comment would make me think twice about making you an moderator. &quot;Senior Member&quot; just means that you become involved in every discussion. Spam-posters also become senior members you know (No disrespect). :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arune</div><div class="date">11th August 2001, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps I wanted to know what the NSIS ppl think of it...<br />
<br />
If you look at the date I registred you would see that it was before you. <br />
I have read almost all post since and the reason that you have post more replies than me could be that english is not my first language and I always have hard to express myself, and therefor I don´t reply if I think that my reply might be missinterpreded!<br />
<br />
I never look at any of the other forums because they don´t interest me, the ppl I am familar with are in this forum and I wanted to know what you all think of the new forum style! <br />
Forgive me, if any moderator agrees with Duane, please remove this thread!<br />
