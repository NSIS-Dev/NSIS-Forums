<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azerger</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking for a way to have one script generate multiple setup.exe's. Each setup.exe would be different based on several defines within the script.  The intent is to run a single script that will cause several different setups to be created.  Each setup is geared towards a specific customer.  I currently have to change some defines in a script and run it multiple times.  Does anyone know how to do this in one shot.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

A batch file would probably work best. Use something like:<br />
<br />
makensis &quot;/DNAME=Product A for customer B&quot; /DUSE_UPX /DINCLUDE_COMPONENT_XYZ<br />
makensis &quot;/DNAME=Product T for customer J&quot; /DDONT_ASK_FOR_DIR<br />
makensis &quot;/DNAME=Product V for customer X&quot; /DSILENT /DINCLUDE_COMPONENT_ABC<br />
<br />
You can also create a header file which you will include in more than one script using !include. The scripts will define some things, add some stuff of their own and create a separate installer based on the included basic script.</div></div><hr />
