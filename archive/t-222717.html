<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tokru</div><div class="date">28th July 2005, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">i have searched the forum for this topic a while but did not find the right answer.<br />
<br />
i need to start another setup during the installation of my application. <br />
<br />
i found a solution by installing the other setup and then running it with ExecWait and it works, but i want to run the setup without copying it on the hard disk. it should be packed in the install exe of my program and should be run during installation. <br />
<br />
<br />
does anybody know a solution?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: How do I know if the setup within the installtion was completed succesfully?</div></div><hr />

Regarding successfull completion- check the exit code. Usually 0 indicates success, but YMMV.</div></div><hr />
