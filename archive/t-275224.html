FindProcDLL is what you are after.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrDan</div><div class="date">6th August 2007, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I probably didn't explain it very well.<br />
<br />
The situation is this: I have two versions of Eclipse installed. Say, for example, they are installed like this:<br />
<br />
C:\Eclipse_1\eclipse.exe<br />
C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe<br />
<br />
Say, both of these are running. If I write<br />
<br />
FindProcDLL::FindProc &quot;C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe&quot; <br />
<br />
it returns 0 (which means it hasn't found a process called &quot;C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe&quot;).<br />
<br />
What I need to be able to kill all Eclipse processes that were launched from &quot;C:\Eclipse_2\eclipse.exe&quot;. I am not allowed to killed anything launched from &quot;C:\Eclipse_1\eclipse.exe&quot;.<br />
<br />
The reason I have to do it this way is that our installer installs some Eclipse plug-ins for the user. The user might well have elected to have several Eclipse installations anyhow, so for our uninstaller, we need to make sure that only the &quot;correct&quot; Eclipse's are killed in order to safely uninstall the plug-ins.<br />
<br />
The point is I need to do more than just identify a process by it's .exe name: I need to identify a process by its .exe path including the .exe name!<br />
<br />
So either I am going nuts, or FindProcDLL doesn't do what I need it to!</div></div><hr />
