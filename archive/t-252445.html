It's either corrupt at the location that you downloaded it from, or got corrupt during the download.<br />
Download it again. Also, it could be anti-virus software corrupting the file. This has happened in the past:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd August 2006, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure your Nortan installation has the latest virus database installed. You should also be able to disable the antivirus manually.<br />
<br />
I haven't used Nortan for a long time, but it is a pain. I suggest you uninstall it and get AVG Free (search Google).<br />
