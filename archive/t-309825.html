<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trobertson</div><div class="date">11th August 2009, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm making an installer and everything is fine except the install directory is not being created which means the uninstall.exe is not created. By default I don't put any files in the $INSTDIR. I figured out, however, that it only creates the folder if I manually specify to put a file there.  Is this a bug?  I would assume the folder, uninstall.exe &amp; uninstall.dat would be generated regardless of me putting any files there or not. As it stands currently (with no folder being created) the installed files are zombied, the menu shortcuts are invalid and I have to uninstall the files manually.<br />
<br />
I could just put a dummy file in at the beginning and delete it at the end but that won't fix the core problem. If I'm not doing something obvious please speak up.</div></div><hr />

And shouldn't you have a WriteUninstaller command too? You could put that after the SetOutPath command.</div></div><hr />
