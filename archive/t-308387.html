<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmlineb</div><div class="date">15th July 2009, 22:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using NSIS/CPack/CMake to create installers for 64-bit applications on Windows Vista.  I am having trouble with UAC, so I downloaded the UAC plugin for NSIS.  <br />
<br />
However, there are two DLLs, one in the A folder and one in the U folder.  I am assuming that A means Administrator and U means User, but evidently only one should be placed in the NSIS\Plugins folder.  The documentation gives no clue about which one to use under what desired conditions.  When should one or the other be used?  I would have assumed that there would be only one DLL and commands to switch between User and Administrator modes, not two separate DLLs.<br />
<br />
Thanks!  Enjoy!<br />

A stands for ANSI, U stands for Unicode. If you're using the unicode build of NSIS, use U. Else use A.</div></div><hr />
