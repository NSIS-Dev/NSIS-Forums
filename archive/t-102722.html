<br />
in the past i saw a NSIS dll, i mean a NSIS-comiler in '*.dll' format. <br />
<br />
Where can i get it?<br />
Are the changes in the sourcecode are OpenSource?<br />
Is it possible to make a NSIS 2.0 (a7) compiler dll?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Have you saw that NSIS dll (NSIS 1.98) too?<br />
<br />
Where i can find it?<br />
<br />
&gt;I think if it will be better if you will just use the source of &gt;makensisw because you won't have to recompile it for every version &gt;of NSIS.<br />
Yes, thank you for the good suggestion!<br />
<br />

Why would you use a DLL? If you want to get the output of Makensis, use the same system as the window wrapper. <br />
<br />
i develop an IDE/Editor for NSIS. And for that i basicly would like:<br />
<br />
-to call the NSIS compiler without a &quot;console window&quot; and catch his &quot;output...&quot;.<br />
-call the NSIS compiler fast (don't create a console window....)<br />
<br />

The MakeNSIS Window Wrapper (MakeNSISW) does exactly the same thing. Have a look at the source.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you think, the time reduction to compile a installer is big between a MakeNSIS dll and a MakeNSISW dll?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestion/help!<br />
<br />

Hello Joost,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the &quot;source of makensisw looks complex....&quot;, i looked at the wrong source, i looked at the source of makensis.<br />
Yes, you are right!<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Have none see a finished/downloadable version of so an dll?<br />
<br />

Hello rainwater,<br />

<br />
The slowness in the current makensisw is caused because of makensisw constantly peeking and copying the output to the console.  This is being changed for the next version.  You shouldn't see much difference in the compile time especially since you would have already loaded the GUI components before you compile.  The advantage of copying the output is that users can use new versions of makensis.exe with the editor.  In fact, you should just add the option to let the user choose which version of makensis.exe to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, i wait for the next version of your makensisw, and create then a makensisw - dll. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, i will add the option to choose several comilers.<br />
Have you any other suggestions additionally, what we should add in N²E?<br />
All suggestions are welcome!<br />
<br />
You (and all other people) can conntact the N²E team here in the forum and via e-mail at: nne-team@lists.sourceforge.net<br />
