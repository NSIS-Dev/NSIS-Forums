<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">2nd May 2004, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am trying to change the pre-selected component dropdown list based on whether the application has been previously installed.<br />
<br />
e.g. I have two component selection choices. Full/Upgrade. If the application has never been installed (FULL) is automatically chosen whereas if an installation is already detected (Upgrade) becomes the automatic default choice.<br />
<br />
I hope I made myself clear. Is this possible? Thank you for any help on the subject :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd May 2004, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, you can read registry keys, files, configuration files, whatever you want.<br />
<br />
Depending on the value of variables, you can decide whether to upgrade or not.</div></div><hr />

I can check to see if a prior installation exist but do not know how to state that if one does, how exactly to go about changing the component selection accordingly...<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help and time on this!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use StrCmp in a section to check the content of a variable and execute the code for full or upgrade.</div></div><hr />
