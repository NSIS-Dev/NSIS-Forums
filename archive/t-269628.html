<br />
   When I am using a skin with the modern UI, the installer (I have generated) crash every time you click (and drag the cursor) in the richedit which is displaying the license.<br />
   I have searched this forum, and the skincrafter plugin's one, but I came up with nothing. No one seems to have this problem.<br />
   I am using NSIS v2.25 and the stable version of the plugin.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why it is crashing ?<br />
 <br />
thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Vincent</div></div><hr />

Does any one know the problem I am talking about ?<br />
<br />
I don't have the time right now, but this week end I will try to a custom page with a richedit control and see if it is the source of the problem or if it is the license page it self.<br />
<br />

[edit] I have just received a response from Paul Gritsay saying that my report has been transfered to the developement team, but they do not plan to release a new version soon. I still have to find a solution.</div></div><hr />
