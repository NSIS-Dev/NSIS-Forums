<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fraeon</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, new poster. I want to tell you a story about what happened when I last used NSIS.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, like you usually do with it, I was working on an installer for a project of mine. Well, I wasn't satisfied on a default installer and I wanted to easily change the settings in my installer, like the default installation/uninstallation paths, application names and so on, so I decided to create an external header for that information. I promptly named in setup.cfg<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I compiled the thing, then installed what was in the installer to see if it worked. Then I UNinstalled it and noticed that my whole 'program files' folder had been deleted. This is when I remembered that I hadn't put any information in the setup.cfg file, I only made the installer to read it. :p<br />
<br />
After that, Windows refused to work. I couldn't start any program, since Windows 2000 is so IE dependent and I just had purged it(accidentally) :( <br />
<br />
Blargh, I'm an idiot.<br />
<br />
Now after re-installing, I have to be more careful. Heh, it was all my fault to begin with, and the Windows needed a re-install anyhow.<br />
<br />
Here ends my story of idiocy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but in fact, every scripting language can be dangerous when in the wrong hands... you can use every installer to drop a trojan or delete files...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was aware that it COULD happen, but I wasn't really prepared that I was the one who would do that mistake. ;) <br />
<br />
Thank God I had a back-up from 2 weeks back so I didn't lose much, really. Except for that installer, that is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was f**** with my register and I was amazed that I deleted <br />
<br />

Is cool to talk about funny stuff. Mostly NSIS forum is for help, sharing, etc...<br />
Sometimes we need a relax time after a long time of hard coding :)<br />
Just play nice ;)</div></div><hr />

Nope, not two weeks on that installer. I did that installer within a day.<br />
<br />
I said that the backup I had was from 2 weeks back. :p<br />
<br />
And luckily I didn't lose anything of much worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i trashed my winxp with some kind of deleting the whole HKLM registry path<br />
<br />
thx god i had a backup image (pq drive image).<br />
<br />
the hardest thing is to trash the bootsecor on c: with some extra tool inside or on win(nt)-systems delete something NTLDR or NTDETECT or in general WIN.<br />
<br />
ok lets stop here :hang:</div></div><hr />

no, because there's no uninstaller there, and this code should be executed when you start the programm.</div></div><hr />
