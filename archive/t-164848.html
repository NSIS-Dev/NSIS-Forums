The code by line 59 has made a jump to either upgradedll.copy, upgradedll.upgrade or upgradedll.done. All those labels, specifically upgradedll.upgrade begin after line 64 witch is: SetOverwrite try.<br />
It is my understanding then that if SetOverwrite is set to on (the default) this is its setting when the File command is executed and the user might get a message box. Should SetOverwrite try be moved to the line following upgradedll.upgrade...:?</div></div><hr />

These commands are valid anywhere in the script, and effect every line below where each one is placed (until overridden by another command).</div></div><hr />
