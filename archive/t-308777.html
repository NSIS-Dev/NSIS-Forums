<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mtconleyuk</div><div class="date">23rd July 2009, 03:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm testing my installer on a Standard User account for which the My Documents folder has been set to be on another computer (so the path to it is //myserver/myaccount/pathtomydocuments/).<br />
<br />
The installer calls UAC::GetShellFolderPath() with ${CSIDL_PERSONAL} to get the path to the user's My Documents folder. This works fine when the installer is running with user privileges.<br />
<br />
Once I call UAC::RunElevated(), however, the call to GetShellFolderPath() fails; the path returned is the empty string.<br />
<br />
This only occurs if the My Documents folder has been mapped to another system; as soon as I restore it to its default location, things work fine.<br />
<br />
Any idea what might cause this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do seem to keep answering my own questions. Probably the process of formulating them for others that makes me think a little more clearly. Sorry for any annoyance factor.</div></div><hr />
