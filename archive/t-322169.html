<br />
I would like to have a banner image for all dialogs in my installer except for one. For this dialog I'd like to use a different bmp. Is this possible using MUI and if so how?<br />
<br />
I am using the MUI_HEADERIMAGE for the default / constant banner and that works. I have tried to use several other options like:<br />
<br />
GetDlgItem $0 $hwndparent 0x414<br />
SetBrandingImage /IMGID=$0 /RESIZETOFIT &quot;other.bmp&quot;<br />
<br />
and this works, but the image is layered behind the default image (z order is off).<br />
<br />
I've also tried: !define ${MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP} &quot;other.bmp&quot; and this too fails.<br />
<br />
What is the best way to accomplish this? <br />
<br />
Thanks so much for the help,<br />
mike</div></div><hr />

You're accessing 0x414, which is ID 1044.  Peeking at MUI2's interface.nsh, it looks like you'd want ID 1046 (0x416).<br />
( oddly enough, I think you should have been fine using $mui.Header.Image - but that's getting yet another control ID; 1039.. no idea which one that actually is. )<br />
<br />
When in doubt... use WinSpy++ or similar to find out what control is what.<br />
<br />
Edit: Although MUI2 doesn't seem too happy about SetBrandingImage at all (lack of branding image).  ${NSD_SetImage} to the rescue for that, then.</div></div><hr />
