<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isolated</div><div class="date">7th April 2003, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
I have very strange bugs here with delete. I have problems with beta3 and the actual CVS Version.<br />
<br />
System: german WinXPsp1 with AthlonXP, german Win98SE (VMware)<br />
<br />
There are bugs with WinXP/Win98 and bugs that appear on both systems:<br />
<br />
1) Look at this script here (almost example1.nsi):<br />
<br />
; example1.nsi<br />
;--------------------------------<br />
<br />
; The name of the installer<br />
Name &quot;Example1&quot;<br />
<br />
; The file to write<br />
OutFile &quot;example1.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
; The default installation directory<br />
InstallDir $PROGRAMFILES\Example1<br />
<br />
; The text to prompt the user to enter a directory<br />
DirText &quot;This will install the very simple example1 on your computer. Choose a directory&quot;<br />
<br />
;--------------------------------<br />
<br />
; The stuff to install<br />
Section &quot;&quot; ;No components page, name is not important<br />
   ;CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\bla.lnk&quot; &quot;c:\command.com&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; 0 &quot;SW_SHOWMINIMIZED&quot; ;delete is not working WinXP/Win98<br />
<br />
   CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\bla.lnk&quot; &quot;c:\command.co&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; 0 &quot;SW_SHOWMINIMIZED&quot; ;delete is working WinXP/Win98<br />
<br />
   delete &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\bla.lnk&quot;<br />
SectionEnd ; end the section<br />
<br />
<br />
On both systems same behaviour (note that under XP there is neither c:\command.com or c:\command.co): In the first case delete does not its job, in the second case, created file is deleted<br />
<br />
2) I have a rather complex script here: ~400 lines. It is the reason why I began to test delete. Here is the following situation:<br />
<br />
The line:<br />
delete &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\Autostart\${BAT_NAME}.lnk&quot;<br />
<br />
DOES work under WinXP, but DOES NOT work under Win98.<br />
<br />
I have a german OS, so my 1st thought was of foreign characters (startmenu is startmen√º in german). But it seems, that this is not the problem.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in the complete script tell me how to send/post it to you. 400 lines is nothing I want to post directly here without asking first<br />
<br />
=&gt; So, are these things a bug or do I need much sleep now?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isolated</div><div class="date">8th April 2003, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">OK. Here it is...<br />
<br />
All things needed in the ZIP file...<br />
<br />
A few parts are not in English; i hope it's not a big problem....<br />
<br />
The line mentioned is in the Uninstall section...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th April 2003, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed! Good point deguix! Windows creates .pif links to DOS programs. That's why you can't delete the link that links to a program with a .com extension, it has a .pif extension. When you removed the m from the extension Windows didn't think it was a DOS program any more and created a .lnk and not a .pif, that's why it worked.<br />
<br />
Good catch deguix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isolated</div><div class="date">8th April 2003, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh man... it was that simple? I'm crying... I will go and try...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isolated</div><div class="date">8th April 2003, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are right!! It is working now...<br />
<br />
Because I sometimes force the detected OS to be Win98 (under WinXP) for testing purposes, I replaced<br />
<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\Autostart\${BAT_NAME}.lnk&quot; &quot;$SYSDIR\${BAT_NAME}&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; 0 &quot;SW_SHOWMINIMIZED&quot;<br />
<br />
with<br />
<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\Autostart\${BAT_NAME}.pif&quot; &quot;$SYSDIR\${BAT_NAME}&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; 0 &quot;SW_SHOWMINIMIZED&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
delete &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\Autostart\${BAT_NAME}.lnk&quot;<br />
<br />
delete &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\Autostart\${BAT_NAME}.pif&quot;<br />
delete &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\Autostart\${BAT_NAME}.lnk&quot;<br />
<br />
In this way I can be sure, that my shortcut is deleted under both systems. As you said: for programs mit .com extension CreateShortCut makes a PIF (WindowsXP as well as Win98); for batch programs CreateShortcut make under WinXP  a lnk, under Win98 a .PIF file...<br />
<br />
Thank you very much...</div></div><hr />
