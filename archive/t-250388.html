<br />
I am a newbie to Pocket PC and NSIS. I have followed MSDN sample to create CAB deployment file for my Pocket PC application in VS2005. And uses HM NIS Edit 2.0.3 to create the installer. (i am still using NSIS 2.15)<br />
<br />
I followed the example Multi CAB Installer to install Compact Framework, SQL CE, SQL CE Client, and my Pocket PC Application. But when it want to install the Pocket PC Applciation, it stop and say that it is an invalid setup file.<br />
<br />
I should explain also what is in my Pocket PC Cab file, it will install the application, copy a few pictures, and create a registry key. I tried to remove the create registry key, but it hang completely.<br />
<br />
i had tried to straight copy the CAB file to my Pocket PC and it install fine.<br />
<br />
I think most probably i create an invalid CAB file. Can any1 point me to a good tutorial or help me? i am willing to attach my script file if any1 think that the problem lies in my NSIS file.<br />
<br />
Thank in advance. and please DO DO help me........<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
so for the benefits of all, i will post the answer here too..<br />
<br />
i found out that the minumum OS version for my cab files is too high, should be 3.0. Another is in the .ini file. I guess there is white space in it so after i copy paste the component name, it is working fine already.<br />

I've spent the day trying to find the solution but although my application CAB installs fine, I get the invalid setup error for CFNET.<br />
<br />
Please take a look at my attached script file to see if you can see what is wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
