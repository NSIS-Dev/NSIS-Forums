Fiffi and i are looking for C/C++ developpers !<br />
A first thread was created, but we're still looking for coders ! Everybody 's welcome ... even if this is only for a very few contribution !<br />
<br />
I very little base has been developped yet [screen capture follows...], and a sourceforge account has been created...<br />

<br />
That GUI project seems to be interresting. Although I read the precedent thread, I still have questions to ask:<br />
1- What is the name of the project: &quot;N²E&quot;, &quot;N-Spot&quot; ;) , &quot;NSIS Studio&quot; ?<br />
2- Are you using Visual C++ or Delphi ? And which version ?<br />
3- What is the sourceforge account ?<br />
4- Do you still need developpers ?<br />
<br />
I could bring you help in C/C++ and Visual C++... :)<br />
The only bad point is I don't have much time. That would be for a ew contribution...</div></div><hr />

1_ project name is N²E<br />
