<br />
I tried adding a side image bitmap to the Finish page on installation and uninstallation. I was surprised to find out that If I add the same image to the install and unsintall using  MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP and MUI_UNWELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP I get twice the file size increase than if I use only one of them. Meaning that if you use both, the image is loaded twice onto the setup executable. Since my application is downloadable through the net, the size of the setup file is of high priority to me.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if someone out there faced the same problem? or if someone knows a fix for the problem.<br />
<br />
Also, an item I put on my NSIS wish-list, and that is support for JPG images sice they are considerably smaller than bmp files.<br />
<br />
Thanks y'all. :)</div></div><hr />

Did you by chance set SetDatablockOptimize to off?  If so try removing that line so that it goes back to the default of on.  When I set SetDatablockOptimize to off it added an extra 21KB to my executable. I used LZMA compression for my tests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th September 2004, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The image is indeed included twice. Once in the installer block and once in the uninstaller block. When using LZMA, solid/whole compression is turned on by default. This makes the affects of a separate datablock for the installer and the uninstaller a bit less noticeable.</div></div><hr />
