<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 01:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still having this issue where when I build a package on a win2k server machine that the welcome/finish image doesn't show up on windows 95 and windows 98 machines. <br />
<br />
Also, custom dialogs created using InstallOptions show up as blank screens.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am running nsis 2.0b3 and had this problem with previous versions. Packages built on Win2k Pro machines work just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure you are not writing Unicode INI files? Can you please attach an example script and its output on that W2K machine for the welcome/finish image issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, can I send them to you via e-mail though? <br />
<br />
The ini files are stored as ascii. The ioSpecial.ini is the default one. The example programs (WelcomeFinish.nsi, InstallOptions.nsi) work correctly on win 9x when built on this machine. The log doesn't seem to indicate any error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have other Win2k Servers to test?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I just figured it out, when kichik asked me if the files were in Unicode I thought of a problem we've been having with our source control system, perforce. The INI files were in the repository as text, and they should have been in there as binary. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help. I might not have thought of it.</div></div><hr />
