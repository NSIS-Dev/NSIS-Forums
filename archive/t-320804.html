I need you help: I'm trying to change the language after the .oninit function. <br />
Is it possible?<br />
I've already read a couple or threads on this and on one the suggestion was to use an external installer. Unfortunately I can't do it because the user must have the possibily to re-change the language again and again... :(<br />
Any idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">14th July 2010, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't really think of any option other than making every dialog a custom dialog so that you have complete control over their content - and thus the strings used - at runtime.<br />
<br />
Why would they need the ability to change the language after initialization, though?  Would be a bit odd to, say, have an English welcome page and then let the user change to Dutch for the Directory page, then change to German for the components page, etc.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is a better solution to what you're trying to do if we know what it is that you are trying to do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guineapig</div><div class="date">16th July 2010, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for feedback, but unfortunately my requirements are more or less like you described: the user will have a welcome page in the OS language and then in the second page he/she will have the option to change the installer language. :(:(<br />
Very weird requirements, but I'm only the arm.... :)<br />
<br />
I think I'll try to proceed as you suggested. <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">16th July 2010, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Move the welcome page to a separate installer executable and extract and execute that from your primary installer's .onInit function. Make sure you use ReserveFile on it so that it's extracted promptly.<br />
<br />
i.e.<br />
Function .onInit<br />
  !system `&quot;${NSISDIR}\makensis.exe&quot; welcomepage.nsi`<br />
  InitPluginsDir<br />
  ReserveFile welcomepage.exe<br />
  File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\welcomepage.exe welcomepage.exe<br />
  ExecWait `&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\welcomepage.exe&quot;`<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
Edit: And your language selection page would need to be in that exe as well. You can pass the chosen language ID via the registry or an INI file.<br />
