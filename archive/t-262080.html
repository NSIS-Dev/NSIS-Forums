<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">See NSIS documentation 4.8.2.9 SetPluginUnload. It might help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thought...<br />
Is it possible that you have placed an Abort in the middle of a section? If yes this could cause the installer not to end properly. Examine the example below to see what I mean.<br />
<br />
outfile test.exe<br />
licensedata '${NSISDIR}\license.txt'<br />
<br />
page license<br />
page instfiles<br />
<br />
section -<br />
messagebox mb_yesno 'Continue?' idyes +2<br />
abort<br />
sleep 2000<br />
messagebox mb_ok 'end of section dude!'<br />
sectionend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ras french</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">i have only one &quot;abort&quot; <br />
<br />
;installer pages<br />
!define MUI_ABORTWARNING<br />
!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE ChangeSubtitleFont<br />
Page Custom WelcomePage ; this is custom page, because standard welcome page does not work correctly<br />
 !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_SHOW Redraw<br />
 ;!define MUI_LICENSEPAGE_CHECKBOX ; you can use it, if you want, radiobuttons too<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE $(LicenseString) <br />
<br />
i have try with &quot; SetPluginUnload alwaysoff &quot; at the end of my script page , but always the same pb. <br />
<br />
If i click on the button &quot;abort&quot; before installing my game , the windows and the setup closed good and desapear from process explorer but if i install my game and then click on the button &quot; close &quot; the windows stay open , setup stay open in process explorer and my pc freeze... i cannot open/close any windows i must go closed setup in process explorer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I can't think of something furthermore. I have not any idea about those plugins that you're using in your script, thus I can't imagine how they act. Must exists documentation and examples included with the plugins that might help you catch the bug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously the conclusion is that there is a running proccess on your 1st pc that is responsible for the conflict. You have to identify that proccess (perhaps an AV or something like this) beacause it is possible that when you spread out your game, others would have the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ras french</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">ohhh sure ! i will see that ... thx</div></div><hr />
