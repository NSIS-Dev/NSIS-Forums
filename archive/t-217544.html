<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john.mcnamee</div><div class="date">31st May 2005, 04:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I really needed to allow users to cancel an installation while it's copying files.  I know this is on the TODO list for a future NSIS release, but I couldn't wait.  It only took a few changes to the installer stub -- the patch is attached.<br />
<br />
You have to specifically enable the Cancel button if you want it (I didn't want to break existing installers).  For example:<br />
Section<br />
  ; Enable CANCEL button<br />
  GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 2<br />
  EnableWindow $0 1<br />
SectionEnd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">2nd June 2005, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I got this working although I never figured out the correct way to use the txt file as a patch.  I ended up just copying and pasting the changes in as needed.  It worked fine under 2.06 and I was also able to modify it a little to get it working in 2.0 since that's the version I'm currently sending everything out in.  Good job.  I've been wanting this not because I thought it should be there but because my QA department keeps pointing it out.  We've also had a few calls from customers.</div></div><hr />

We've also had a few calls from customers.Aborting an installation may leave a mess behind, but you've got to consider the alternative.  I've got a large installation that can take 10 minutes to complete.  If I didn't provide some way for users to bail out, they'll bring up Task Manager and start nuking random processes.</div></div><hr />

I hope I'll be able to get to it next weekend.<br />

One outstanding problem is that you still can't cancel during extraction of big files. It'll be great if you can resolve this in your patch. However, I'll probably include the current patch as an option, even if you don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to use patch.exe from http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ with no success.  I tried to modify the NSIS source code manually, but my compiler is screwed and gives me error messages.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions on how to get this working?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We were just looking into this exact issue and you cannot cancel during the file copy.</div></div><hr />
