<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psyke</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">before i begin i just wanted to say that i looked through the forums and NSIS docs for the answers. if i missed something, i'm sorry, please point me at it.<br />
<br />
i'd like to know, step by step, how i should translate an installer into a language that doesn't have .nlf or .nsh files already.<br />
<br />
here's what i think i'm suppposed to do, please correct any errors:<br />
<br />
in this example i'll pick norwegian. :)<br />
[list=1]<br />
 use makelangid to make an id, but which sublang to choose (NORWEGIAN_[BOKM|NYNO]), and if there is no sublang like for AFRIKAANS, then what - choose _NEUTRAL, _DEFAULT, or _SYS_DEFAULT?<br />
 translate English.nlf and English.nsh, save as Norwegian.nlf (add makelangid's result here), Norwegian.nsh<br />
(are the language files always plain ascii text files?)<br />
 define installer lang strings like 'LangString TestString ${LANG_NORWEGIAN} &quot;some norwegian text&quot;'<br />
(is LANG_NORWEGIAN based on the filename, or has to be defined somewhere?)<br />
 use '!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Norwegian&quot;'<br />
(again, this is based on the filename, Norwegian.nsh?)<br />
[/list=1]<br />
<br />
thanks for your help! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there are no sublangs you should chose SUBLANG_DEFAULT, though it doesn't really matter as long as there are no other language files with the same main language.<br />
<br />
If there are sunlangs you should chose the on that fits best. In English for example there are sublangs for America, UK, Austalia, etc. If you use colour instead of color you should choose UK.<br />
<br />
The language files are always plain ASCII (MBCS) and never Unicode.<br />
<br />
LANG_NORWEGIAN is automatically defined according to the file name.<br />
<br />
MUI_LANGUAGE also works according to the file name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am glad that i got the procedure right - it will come in handy if i'm ever in this situation. :)</div></div><hr />
