<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shooky</div><div class="date">19th July 2003, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Let me start by saying well done to the guys that created NSIS.<br />
I am currently writing my first serious install. My company had already bought Installshield for lots of $$$ so I gave it a shot. I spent about a week trying to write a pretty simple install before I gave up. It took me a couple of hours to find out about NSIS on google, read the manual and finish the entire install script.<br />
Simply amazing.<br />
<br />
And now for the question:<br />
I need a way to post this install file on the web and have the user install it with one click - no &quot;would you like to save the file or open it&quot; messages, nothing but the digital signature dialog.<br />
All the &quot;one click installs&quot; I saw were made with Installshield, but I realy don't want to go back to using Installshield just for this feature.<br />
<br />
Do you know of a tool/open code project/way to implement this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;One click&quot; installations can be made with the help of<br />
SilentInstall silent<br />
<br />
excerpt from the documentation<br />
<br />
4.8.1.33 SilentInstall<br />
<br />
normal|silent|silentlog<br />
<br />
Specifies whether or not the installer should be silent. If it is 'silent' or 'silentlog', all sections that have the SF_SELECTED flag are installed quietly (you can set this flag using see SectionSetFlags), with no screen output from the installer itself (MessageBoxes are still displayed on error, and the script can still display whatever it wants). Note that if this is set to 'normal' and the user runs the installer with /S on the command line, it will behave as if SilentInstall 'silent' was used. Note: see also LogSet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shooky</div><div class="date">20th July 2003, 07:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I would post an installation file on the web and the user experience should be like this:<br />
1) The user clicks a &quot;click here to install&quot; button.<br />
2) The security warning dialog pops-up (that's ok, the install is digitally signed).<br />
3) The user clicks &quot;ok&quot; on the security warning dialog.<br />
4) The install is being runs.<br />
<br />
I am already using 'SilentInstall silent' so that when the install runs it would be silent, but I can't get the posted install file to run immediately after the user clicks, without getting the usual &quot;save or open file&quot; message.</div></div><hr />
