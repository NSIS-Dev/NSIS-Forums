<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could make the installer on the first disk and put the files on the other disks using unzip dll. Or make a self-extracting zip that starts the installer after unzip... Lots of possibilities to workaround...<br />
<br />
:-H</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, I would like to be able to split installations too.<br />
<br />
A good idea would be to add an instruction for this:<br />
<br />
SplitAt &quot;1440000&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Smile2Me, this work arounds are very, very tough.<br />
<br />
NSIS can make installers of 2GB, we really need to split:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">And you want to distribute these 2Gb on disks?<br />
<br />
Hahaha, that made my day :) How funny :D:D:D<br />
<br />
Anyway, it is not that difficult if you eg use winzip to span. With the self extractor possibility you can even make the installer available for anyone (even if they don't have winzip). Just use winzip to span... that's all... And it is really the easiest way. And the cost is only minor: an additional header for the zipexe of around 30k. Well, with 2Gb's to put on a disk, this 30Kb does not really make a difference ;)<br />
<br />
By the way, how are you planning to send all these disks to your customers? I would suggest an oil tanker per customer ;)<br />
<br />
:-H</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">well, your post was really funny:up:<br />
:)<br />
:D <br />
<br />
anyway, if I want to distribute that 2GB in cdrs I still need to span the file.<br />
<br />
And the cost is more than 30kB, because I will have two copies of the same, one in a single archive and another spanned, and count the time wasted....<br />
<br />
Apart from this, we already have a header for nsis, do we need another for the span? I don't know how this things go (maybe is difficult to make spans), but from the outside of the oil tanker this seems easy:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't know what the plans of spanning are, but when it would be possible to span, I would not use it, but program my way around it with several zip's, cab's or anything. That is still the safest way to distribute. If you just have 1 huge file and one disk gets lost/damaged, the rest cannot be used anymore...<br />
<br />
Besides that, using separate cabinet files, it is much easier to distribute specific components in separate files instead of in one huge container. Most components of huge programs have a lot of files in all kind of dirs. This would mean that you have to extract all files by manually addressing them. Instead, you can make a cab/zip for each component, containing dir info such that extraction automatically places files in the right dir. That would work with just one command.<br />
<br />
But that point is of course only valid for large programs/installers with a lot of options/components.<br />
<br />
But for small programs/installers (&lt;5Megs), splitting could be usefull, but I still wonder if it is not far more easy to use zip/unzip dll and control the extraction yourself. Besides that, are you using disks? Actually, I did not use disks anymore for almost 4 now. And since Win 3.1 left us, I actually never met an installer on a disk :) But hey, who am I...<br />
<br />
/me laughing about those good old Dos 6.22 and QBasic days :D<br />
<br />
:-H</div></div><hr />

Yes, you are right. But this is an installation program. What can you do with half program?<br />
<br />
Anyway, if spanning is not added I won't complain. But IMO it would be useful.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it would be a nice feature.  The problem is there is little need anymore for being able to split files across floppy disks as they are used so seldom these days.  Unfortunately, this is something that would be be on the bottom of lists of things to add to NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dick4</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 02:17</div></div><div class="posttext">can we make a poll like someone did for the license check box?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Polls are quite useles.<br />
<br />
Of course there are some people who would like to see such a feature. However, floppy disks are used seldom these days, so it won't be added soon. There are a lot of other things that have priority.</div></div><hr />
