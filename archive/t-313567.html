<br />
I have built an installer(using NSIS) which has couple of MSIs embedded inside it. I execute these constituent MSIs by invoking &quot;msiexec&quot; using ExecWait.<br />
<br />
Now, the installation of the constituent MSIs goes fine, but I get an exception when I try to &quot;Repair&quot; the constituent MSI  installation from the Add-Remove Program. The error reads as follows --<br />
<br />
&quot;The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Click OK to try again, or enter the alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'xyx.MSI' in the box below.&quot; (and the box contains a path of my temp folder).<br />
<br />
As I understand it, the Windows caches the MSI when it is run on a machine (WINNT\Installer). I can see that there is an MSI in this folder for the one that I installed .<br />
<br />
Also, the un-install of these constituent MSIs goes perfectly fine. I just face the problem on repair.<br />
<br />
Can some suggest what could be going wrong here?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
SB</div></div><hr />
