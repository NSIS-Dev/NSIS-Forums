<br />
I am trying to bundle my avs presets into a Pimpbot installer, and it keeps saying 'creation failed' then giving me this log.<br />
I uninstalled and re-installed nsis and pimpbot, but it still happens. I can't make heads or tails of .nis scripting.:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">3rd April 2005, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">It means that you have &quot;MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_DESCRIPTION_INFO&quot;<br />
Defined twice.  <br />
<br />
Becuase it's referencing the MUI_LANGUAGE, I'd say that either you have the macro in the wrong place  (review the MUI docs for more info) or you are calling the macro more than one time (either in your main script or in one of your !include files).<br />
<br />
(Keep in minder that NSIS's compiler simply reads scripts from the top down.  Each time you reference another NSH file, it merges the file into the script.  This way, the compiler only sees one big script file.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beeferoni</div><div class="date">3rd April 2005, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">erm, I'm afraid I am a complete and utter noob with these file extensions. In layman's terms, does it basically mean I have the same file twice somewhere? (Because Pimpbot writes all the nis script itself. I couldn't write one line to save my life.) So I don't even know what MUI or NSH files are. Sorry to be such a noob...:|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Not the same file defined twice, but the same !define was used twice.  Since MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_DESCRIPTION_INFO is used in the macro MUI_LANGUAGE, I'd say your script is probably calling this more than once (or you simply have the MUI_LANGUAGE macro in the wrong place.)<br />
<br />
!define or !include statements are explained in the help manual.  As for the MUI, take the time to look at the readme document installed along with NSIS (${NSISDIR/Contrib/Modern UI/Readme.html).  This is where you'll find the proper usage of the MUI_LANGUAGE command.<br />
<br />
You might also want to look at some of the example scripts included with the NSIS installation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">are you using the latest version of pimpbot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is with a bad Russian translation that was included in 2.05. A fixed version is included with 2.06.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beeferoni</div><div class="date">10th May 2005, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I should have had the latest version of pimpbot (2.06) loaded; I believe I loaded it directly from your deviant adress, Yathosho. In any case, I will re-dl it and try again. Thanks for all your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">11th May 2005, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">the latest version of pimpbot is 2.15, but as kichik said before, upgrading to nsis 2.06 will fix the issue</div></div><hr />
