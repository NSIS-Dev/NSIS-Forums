<br />
I need some help with installation on x64 and x32. I hope someone can help.<br />
<br />
I have a 32 bit ODBC driver that I need to install on Windows 32 and 64 bit operating systems.<br />
<br />
On 64 bit, I request that the driver goes to $sysdir and it goes to \syswow64 - this is correct! It's where I want it to go, along with all the other 32 bit ODBC drivers.<br />
<br />
My problem is with the Registry. I need to write the directly this file has been placed but when I put the value $sysdir into the registry, it says \system32 (which is incorrect of course).<br />
<br />
What is the correct way for me to obtain the directory into which my files have been placed?<br />
<br />
(I have seen a few questions posted like this but was not able to work it out). <br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the correct way to proceed to switch off redirection? If so, is there anything in NSIS that will act to help me locate the directories i need (like the location of syswow64?).</div></div><hr />
