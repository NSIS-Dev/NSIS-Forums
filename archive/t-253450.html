<br />
I am builiding an install package that installs apache at one stage, I am using the Apache windows exe. Now this is all good and working fine but I want to use an installer that installs to a different directory other than c:\program files, which is the default in the Apache installer.<br />
<br />
So I see a few ways I can do this which throws up some questions.<br />
<br />
1. I could make my own install exe package of Apache and set it up so it installs to my desired directory. For this I would need to know what registry keys need to be set and which files I need to include.<br />
<br />
2. Run the installer as normal and after install, with NSIS, move the Apache directory out of Program Files to the directory I want it to be in and then reset all the keys. For this I would need to know all the registry keys that need to be set in an Apache install?<br />
<br />
3. Compile my own version. BUT I am thinking that this will not help in anyway how the exe installer sets the directory to c:\program files.<br />
<br />
So basically what I think I need is a list of registry keys that are set by the Apache windows exe installer and what they should be set to/ represent. Where would I find this information?<br />
<br />
OR is there a better way that anyone can think of doing this.  Am I approching the problem in the correct way? The point is to get an automated installation of Apache.<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gurnard123</div><div class="date">17th August 2006, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the command line switch would work; what is it, how would I (inject!?!?) this to the apache exe installer?  <br />
<br />
This is the kind of advice I am looking for as I am new to this and only have to make the install package once so I have a lot of stuff to learn that I will never need to use again, which is a shame but there you go.<br />
<br />
thanks for reading <br />
<br />
Funky avatar by the way Afrow, nice one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gurnard123</div><div class="date">17th August 2006, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">So Afrow you would suggest something like this:<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;apache.exe /DINSTALLDIR=c:\dira\dirb myscript.nsi&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple of things I am not totally clear about here the apache.exe would need to accept and be looking for a variable INSTALLDIR, correct?  I think it might be difficult to find this out as it is the standard Apache windows installer.<br />
<br />
And also what is the myscript.nsi referencing?  What is this script.<br />
<br />
cheers for reading.<br />

This does the trick to set the install dir:<br />
<br />
F:\downloadedSoftware&gt;apinst.exe /v&quot;INSTALLDIR=\&quot;c:\z\&quot;<br />
<br />
thanks for your help man.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />
