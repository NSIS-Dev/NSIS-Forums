I need to create a directory that is only writable, but I can't find any reference on how to do this.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Do you have permissions to create a writtable folder in that location? What OS, what version of NSIS. A code sample would be handy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdrudolp</div><div class="date">21st June 2004, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay here is some more information - I am trying to install some software with an NSIS script logged in as one user and then run it logged in as another user on a WinXP.  I have debugged the problem down to the fact that when my software starts to write to a directory upon invokation, it dies since the directory is only set up read/exec.  User 2 doesn't have permissions to write to it.  I have been searching around and found some stuff related to this problem on thread http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=122794&amp;highlight=createdirectory.  I'll give that a shot and see if it works.</div></div><hr />

Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrYpT</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any features of the AccessControl plugin that can be used under Windows NT4? I know it says that it will not work, but I am wondering if that's just the registry functions that don't work, specifying SID's that doesn't work, or if it is everything in general.</div></div><hr />
