<br />
This is my first post here, so apologies if I made a forum no-no.<br />
<br />
I am trying to make a script that has multiple sections, and some of those sections are in groups.  What I need is for only one section to be selectable at a time.  This I have done, however, when I check the sub-section box, all of the sections in that group get selected.  Is there a way to a) make the sub-section box select the first of the section, or b)make the sub-section box non-functional?<br />
<br />
I also have a Read Only document, which now gets unselected, but this is a side problem.  I will probably just make the RO install with every selection to avoid that.<br />
<br />
Again, very new to this stuff, perhaps I didn't explain very well.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Edit:  Perhaps I can do better :)<br />
<br />
Basically I have:<br />
<br />
A<br />
 A1<br />
 A2<br />
B<br />
 B1<br />
 B2<br />
C<br />
D<br />
<br />
My goal is that someone can select A1, A2, B1, B2, C, OR D.  When the installer starts, this is possible.  However, if A is selected A1 and A2 will become selected.  Then B can be selected, at which time A1 and A2 remain selected and B1 and B2 are selected.  At this point, clicking on C will deselect all and select C (which is good).<br />
<br />
Is there a way to &quot;break&quot; A and B?</div></div><hr />
