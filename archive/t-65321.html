<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s0mbre</div><div class="date">11th November 2001, 08:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
I just got NSIS 1.64 and I quickly went through the included documentation.  I did learn a few things, but I'm no closer to making an installer. ;) <br />
<br />
If anyone can direct me to some documentation, tutorials or guides on how to make an installer with NSIS, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Just so you know I'm not a moron, I've done a fair bit of programming - Motorola 68k assembler, C, C++ so it's not like I'm totally green. :)<br />
<br />
But I have no clue where I should start with NSIS.  By the way the installer I'd like to make is quite simple, all it has to do is drop a bunch of files and set/create some registry entries depending on the OS. (win 9x, NT, etc.)<br />
<br />
Thank you. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
my advise: take a look at the example files. I learned to program an installation in less than 10 minutes by doing that.<br />
<br />
Or download the NSIS Workbench: http://www.techmarc.ndirect.co.uk/fnsetup.exe<br />
<br />
which has a wizard to set up an installation.<br />
<br />
Good luck, :D Smile2Me</div></div><hr />

<br />
I quickly went through 'Example1' and 'Example2' before retiring and that cleared things up a bit. ;)<br />
<br />
I still have a long way to go - clearly further study is required.  I'm just a little tired and was hoping for a HOWTO sort of guide.  I know how hard it is write to clear and comprehensive documentation though, and I appreciate the resources available. :)<br />
<br />
And on the Workbench - I noticed the rave reviews and downloaded it last night.  I just thought it would be wise to know how to do things 'by hand' but I certainly intend to try the workbench. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again. :)</div></div><hr />
