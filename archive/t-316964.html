<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davekr</div><div class="date">11th February 2010, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 functions that I need to call from a dll that gets installed with our product.  FuncA gets called, does some stuff and then passes back a pointer to an object.  FuncB then takes a pointer to that pointer as a parameter.  However, when I call FuncA (which appears to work) and then call FuncB, FuncB causes the whole installer to crash.  <br />
<br />
Here are some more details...<br />
The first function has the following signature:<br />
<br />
int __stdcall FuncA(const char* x, const char* y, void* object)<br />
<br />
In my Nullsoft script I call that using the following:<br />
<br />
System::Call /NOUNLOAD 'myDLL::FuncA(t `${_X}`, t `${_Y}`, p .${_OBJECT}) i.r0'<br />
<br />
The function is doing what it is supposed to, but it does not seem to return a pointer to the object in ${_OBJECT}.<br />
<br />
The second function has the following signature:<br />
<br />
int __stdcall FuncB(void** object)<br />
<br />
In my Nullsoft script I call that using the following:<br />
<br />
System::Call /NOUNLOAD 'myDLL::FuncB(*p ${_OBJECT}) i.r0'<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer some suggestions on how to properly solve these problems?<br />
<br />
1) Why doesn't ${_OBJECT} get the pointer when I call FuncA<br />
2) Am I even close to representing a void** in my System::Call for FuncB?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
When calling FuncB, you do NOT want to use * since it is not a pointer that the system plugin is going to touch, you just want to pass its VALUE<br />
<br />
But there is something else wrong here, there is no way FuncA as declared can pass back a pointer, it would have to be void**object, and FuncB would NOT need void** unless its going to give you back a different pointer. So you either typed out the wrong thing in your post, or there is something else you are missing.<br />
<br />
Also, it would help if you removed the defines and just used r[X] when testing, would make it more clear to us since we don't know what ${_OBJECT} is</div></div><hr />
