<br />
Download it here:<br />
http://amibct.googlepages.com/AMIB.NSIS.Lrn.Persian.1.1.rar<br />
<br />
Password:<br />
www.pcseven.com <br />
<br />
I've also edited the NSIS Tutorials page<br />
it was wonderful editing someone else site!<br />
<br />
have a nice day<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">28th October 2007, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Why password the .rar?<br />
<br />
http://virusscan.jotti.org/ reports a trojan in the .pdf<br />
<br />
A couple of pretty useless looking examples for a 42 page pdf does not seem right, all of this feels dodgy to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th October 2007, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">You've edited the wrong page. You've edited the tutorial picture page. You should instead create a new page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Starting_a_new_page) and add it to the tutorials category ([[Category:Tutorials]]).<br />
<br />
As for the virus, Jotti came out clean for me and running the PDF showed no weird behavior. On top of that, the content seems relevant. But I do have to agree a passworded RAR file seems suspicious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">28th October 2007, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess everything is ok then, I'm sorry for attacking your tutorial. It's just that protecting a archive with a password is a common way to get past anti virus (not really on the end users system, but everything in between (e-mail and such))<br />
<br />
Also, the pdf does not open in SumatraPDF (I guess it does not support the compression/encryption this PDF uses)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMIB</div><div class="date">29th October 2007, 07:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The images are compressed by jpeg2000 format and I think that it's the problem why it doesn't open there<br />
<br />
That's a great tutorial in Persian<br />
and took me 3 months to write and edit it.<br />
<br />
About the password:<br />
It was uploaded before with password and because of my internet speed I preferred not to upload it again...<br />
<br />
I couldn't find a better way to edit that page<br />
plz help me...<br />
<br />
I could create a page but how can I add it to tutorials?<br />
it's here:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/PersianTut<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
Excuse me<br />
I finally got successful doing the job<br />
It was the first time for me using a wiki:blah: ;)</div></div><hr />
