<br />
I am currently developing an installer which installs 3 different softwares. Before I install them, I want to check the registry entry for each of them to see if they have already been installed. Currently I have one logic in place which checks the specified registry key, when provided the root and the main key, I loop through under main key to see if I can find the required key.<br />
<br />
I encountered one more scenario where the key I am looking for may exist under any of the key, which are under main key.<br />
<br />
for ex: I have installed a piece of SOFTWARE-A on my system. Earlier it was version 1.6 what I had on my system and it had a registry entry under HKLM like &quot;SOFTWARE\SOFTWARE-A\1.6\Client&quot;. Here I am interested to know If the key &quot;Client&quot; exists.<br />
<br />
I upgraded SOFTWARE-A to 1.7 and the registry entry of it also changed and now the &quot;Client&quot; key shows up under 1.7.<br />
<br />
In this scenario when I upgraded, a new key 1.7 was created and the &quot;Client&quot; is under it but the earlier key 1.6 is still showing up under the registry and it is empty, it does not have anything under it.<br />
<br />
In this case I know the main key till SOFTWARE-A (SOFTWARE\SOFTWARE-A\) under HKLM and I want to check if key &quot;Client&quot; is available under any of the keys under main key.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me in this?</div></div><hr />
