<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fabpolli</div><div class="date">12th November 2012, 08:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
   I have to run an exe file renamed to dll, with the previous installation system I used these instructions successfully:<br />
l = CreateProcessA (0 &amp;, Command, 0 &amp;, 0 &amp;, 1 &amp;, NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, 0 &amp;, 0 &amp;, yes, oProcess)<br />
         l = WaitForSingleObject (oProcess.hProcess, INFINITE)<br />
         l = CloseHandle (oProcess.hProcess)<br />
now using exec, execwait or even plugin nsExec but I do not do anything. Does anyone have any idea?<br />
Thanks in advance for any replies<br />
Best regards<br />
  Fabrizio</div></div><hr />

(And yes, renaming a exe to dll is pretty stupid)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fabpolli</div><div class="date">14th November 2012, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the problem is related with the exe. This exe is signed and doesn't work if it's name is changed (name or extension doesn't matter, any change is not allowed), others exe renamed as dll works fine!</div></div><hr />
