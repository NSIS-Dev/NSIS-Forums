<br />
I have compiled an installer from a rather simple script. <br />
Besides installing an executable + dll, it should install one font.<br />
I am using a method suggested in this forum. Installation works fine, until, at the end of the process, an &quot;invalid File handle&quot; error pops up and the font does not get installed.<br />
This error occurs on Win XP, Win 7 and even under Wine emulation. <br />
I have double-checked the source path of the font on the source system, it is valid and the script does not give any error message during compile time.<br />
<br />
Could someone have a second look on the attached script - probably it's a stupid error I just can't see it at the moment ...<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Jan</div></div><hr />

Googling the EM results in a lot of unsolved cases but they seem to be PC specific.  &quot;invalid File handle&quot; hmm is there anything obvious in ProcessExplorer or even your eventvwr?</div></div><hr />

<br />
one information I should add is that I am using a linux machine to compile the installer. This may be one reason for the difficulties I encountered with font installation.<br />
<br />
I was able to resolve the problem by putting the font file into the same directory as the script and modifying the script accordingly. <br />
<br />
So for me the result is: For all other files that I want to install, I can give absolute paths on the source machine, even on a linux machine.<br />
In case of fonts, if I give the absolute path on the linux machine, the installer will be compiled without error, but the installer cannot find the font file on the target machine, after unpacking the data.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

P.S.: Here is the final script for reference in case anybody might face the same problem:</div></div><hr />
