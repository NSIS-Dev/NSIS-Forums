I want my setup to have the product version in the titlebar of the dialogs and to contain only the product name inside the dialogs. I see that it uses the text set with the Name function in both places and also that this text is somehow used by the $(^NameDA) variable which is used in the language scripts (English in my case..). So one thing that can be done is to change the product name directly in the english.nsh in all messages, but I don't want to do this, since if I get a newer version of NSIS I will have to do it again, because there may have changed some of the messages. Also I don't want to redefine the texts that contain the product name in my script, because of the same reasons. So how can I change only the title bar to use some other text or the other option - how to change the $(^NameDA) to use other text? btw - I can not find at all where $(^NameDA) is defined and I am not sure what it is in fact..</div></div><hr />
