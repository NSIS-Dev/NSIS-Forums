<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jrenbaum</div><div class="date">12th March 2010, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We would like to add an option to the License Agreement screen that allows the end-user to easily print the agreement. Currently, there is no option to print from within the installer. One can mark the text and use Control C to copy it and then paste it into a document and then print, but this is not obvious.<br />
<br />
I suppose this print option could be added to any screen, but the one we are interested in is the License Agreement screen. Is anyone aware of a way to do this or a plug-in that supports this ability?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

or create your own license page (custom page):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jrenbaum</div><div class="date">18th March 2010, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I've created a custom license page that allows me to print the EULA and disable the next button until the I Agree checkbox has been selected. However, when I try to use this approach on a project that uses a eula.rtf file for the license agreement, the license displayed on the screen is displayed in raw text format and is unreadable as a result. Does anyone know how to get around this other than saving the file in both .rtf and .txt formats in the version control system?<br />
<br />
Another approach - I understand that MUI2 allows for displaying rtf text in the license page and have tried this, but I haven't been able to add a print button to this screen. I thought that the page custom functions PRE, SHOW and LEAVE could be used to help me add a button, but they don't seem to act on the actual page, just before or after. Is this correct? Can page custom functions PRE, SHOW and LEAVE actually affect a page directly?<br />
<br />
The other option was to use Resource Hacker to add a button, but I did not understand from the link provided how this would be done. Any additional explanation would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th March 2010, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to add the button using Resource Hacker (to UIs\modern.exe) and then use the ButtonEvent plug-in to get it to call a function on click. You'll need to then extract a copy of your RTF and then print it using ExecShell.<br />
