<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biffbaxter</div><div class="date">1st October 2009, 03:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I searched the forum and did not find a specific answer to my question, although I did find some related stuff.<br />
<br />
I have an installer.exe that is about 200 Megabytes in size.  When it is launched, it can take more than 20 seconds to show the first screen on a relatively fast machine.  I am told this is because the installer is copying the 200 Megs worth of files to a temp directory.<br />
<br />
I would like the installer to show me the first screen much more quickly, like in about one second.  How can I achieve this?<br />
<br />
Can I background the file copy?<br />
<br />
Can I delay the file copy until after the first screen is launched?<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Add this to test..<br />
CRCCheck Off<br />
<br />
You may want to split the package up as well..<br />
