<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandyB</div><div class="date">26th March 2007, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a new user and don't quite understand the scipt syntax.  I want to first do a very simple install:<br />
1. Make a new folder named &quot;CLXP&quot;<br />
2. Unzip a program file named &quot;FileA&quot; into it.<br />
3. Make a shortcut to operate that on the desktop.<br />
Could someone give ma a kickstart to do this. I think I can get it after that.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandyB</div><div class="date">26th March 2007, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I did, and they all seem to do a lot more than I need for the first try.  That's why I wanted help with something really easy so I can figure it out.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">26th March 2007, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">What could be easier than the included example1.nsi and example2.nsi ? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandyB</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 01:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, what I want to do should be easier, and I had hoped that if I could see a script which does that done by someone who knows what they're doing, then I could probably figure out the rest without asking for more help. But if that's not possible, let me just ask the several questions I have from looking at, compiling and running Example1.nsi:<br />
1. InstallDir $PROGRAMFILES\Example1---I don't want to give the user a choice where to install it, I want the installer to create a folder if it doesn't exist and install a compressed program file in that folder.  What do I replace this line with to do that?<br />
2. Page directory---I don't want to show a browse combo box, I just want to have a page that shows text that tells the user what's going to happen and has a Continue and a Cancel button.  So what do I call that page? Do I need to design one with a graphics editor or is there already one like that?<br />
3. Section &quot;&quot;;No components page, name is not important---I do have a file &quot;FileA&quot; to be installed in the newly created folder, so what is the syntax and punctuation to state that correctly?<br />
4.  I want to create a shortcut on the desktop to start the program &quot;FileA&quot;. How do I do that?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help with these questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 02:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on example1.nsi:<br />
<br />
1. Remove all Page tags.<br />
2. Maybe you should add a license page about that shows text that tells the user what's going to happen.<br />
3. in Section, just add your Files with File instruction, see IfFileExists to test if there's a file. For shortcuts, see example2.nsi in section Section &quot;Start Menu Shortcuts&quot;.<br />
<br />
Good luck! :up:</div></div><hr />
