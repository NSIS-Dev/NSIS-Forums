I need to install a single huge file (maybe even bigger than 2GB). How do I make it into four 640-MB (CD size) chunks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">18th October 2004, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">1. possibility:<br />
pack the installer to a splitted self-extracting archive with winzip, winrar or similar.<br />
2. possibility:<br />
don't pack it into an installer, but let the installer copy it from the cd and kit/install it on the hd.</div></div><hr />

I launched my package from network drive and then Disconnected it, as a result - &quot;Error decompressing data! Corrupted installer?&quot; Or Installer must be copied to tmp folder first like they do it on uninstall, I can see just created A~NSISu_.exe in Local Settings/Temp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">21st October 2004, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">What about placing a specific file on each CD so the installer can differentiate between the CDs.<br />
<br />
Then you start with CD 1 where the Autostart calls a batch (or something similiar) which copies the installer to a temp Directory and starts installing from CD1, after the files from CD1 you prompt the user to change CD - on which he can react with ok or cancel if the input is ok you check for the specific file on the CD and if its correct, you proceed  -in the End you can close your installer and delete the installer.exe from the temp folder...<br />
<br />
have i reinvented the wheel or was this what you need?</div></div><hr />
