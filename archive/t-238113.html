<br />
I want to create the outfile in a directory that contains the version, e.g. &quot;c:\output\${version}\setup.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess I can create that directory with a !system call. The main problem is that I cannot use StrCpy to set the value:<br />
<br />
strcpy $var1 &quot;c:\output\${version}&quot;<br />
#enter system call to create the directory here =)<br />
outfile &quot;$var1\setup.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not possible as strcpy is not allowed outside a section.<br />
Is there anyone who would like to create a patch that the outfile directory is created if non-existent?<br />
<br />
<br />
How can I solve this problem?<br />
<br />

<br />
CreateDirectory &quot;${version}&quot;<br />
SetOutPath &quot;${version}&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
it´s not about the system, where the program is to be installed, but about the system, where I create the setup.<br />
<br />
I want to keep a history of recent setups and don´t want to have them all in just one directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A quick suggestion would be to make a batch file that creates your ${version} directory and then compiles your NSI script to output your EXE into your newly created directory.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to just append your ${version} value to your EXE's filename--that would leave all your builds in 1 directory though.</div></div><hr />

Nevermind, it seems like I´m not good in explaining things :)<br />
<br />

<br />
So, I have to create a batch file that accepts the version number as a parameter, creates the directory and starts the compile script. The compile script also accepts the version number as a parameter.<br />
<br />
Is this what you thought of?<br />

That´s the way I already have it :)</div></div><hr />

Exactly. That should work. You can also look into automated building tools that are a little more user-friendly than batch files (e.g., http://finalbuilder.com, http://ant.apache.org/), but that may be overkill if all you want to automate is creating a new directory and having your EXE go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larsen</div><div class="date">15th February 2006, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your help!<br />
I´ll have a look into those building tools.<br />

Nice, I didn't know about that command. Using it with 'subst' lets you create directories even on unmapped network shares. Very handy.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, great! Exactly what I was looking for.<br />
Thank you very much!<br />
