<br />
I'm migrating our installer from the now defunct Wise Installation system.<br />
<br />
I need to achieve a dialog with additional buttons in the footer, and I can't figure out how to do this. (Getting the ListView with checkboxes was no problem with nsDialogs and some Win32 calls).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to get additional push buttons added to the footer in NSIS? nsDialogs does not appear to give me this option. Controls are clipped if I try to move them into the footer area.<br />
<br />
This is what I'm trying to achieve:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">18th January 2010, 02:08</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing you could try is to re-parent some nsDialog buttons with $hwndparent as the new parent when calling SetParent (Totally unsupported, not even sure if it will work, but you could give it a shot)<br />
<br />
The other ugly option is to use my subclass plugin; http://nsis.sourceforge.net/WndSubclass_plug-in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">18th January 2010, 03:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I think from a UI perspective that you should not put those 2 buttons down on the bottom. Back/Next/Cancel are unified controls for the whole installer.<br />
<br />
Keeping the check listbox with the All/None buttons together fits better visually. You would need to shrink the listbox and put the buttons on the bottom or on the right side with slightly different text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pnielsen</div><div class="date">18th January 2010, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">That is right. However, Back/Next/Cancel stay in the same place all the time. From an UI perspective you can consider the unused blank area to the right of the back button a &quot;custom area&quot;, especially for one time use. Think of it like this: The two buttons are there all along but hidden in all other dialogs but this one ;)<br />
<br />
Because of existing documentation (including printed documentation) I would prefer not to change the design. However, if I have to change the design, the ideal approach is probably to change the list view to a tree view with a top node checkbox that easily lets you select or deselect all...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Just what I needed to know. Works like a charm. Thank you. Problem solved!<br />
