<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 03:33</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree instead of next? yeah it will make the guys asking for an iagree box quite but even though that is meant as a licence page some people (i.e. me) may use it as a short readme/nfo type info box, in which case the user will be agreeing with the feature set and not a licence which seems silly. so i propose this. its just a button caption right? so allow us to set our own text, default it to 'Agree' But allow us to modify it ourselves. either that or go back to the agree box but make it optional cause right now i am reinstalling 1.55 to rebuild one of my installers so it doesnt look silly :p<br />
<br />
p.s. not trying to be an ass just trying to make things better for everyone :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's updated now, and nullsoft.com will be updated with the new 1.56 in about 20 minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 06:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since we are making requests, could you implement the branding text that ExoticMandables created for his version of NSIS, named NSISlch?????<br />
<br />
And can you implement the ASS I/O functions into NSIS??? It would be cool to use a .ASS file to pack items into.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Errrmm... I think adding the ASS io routines will be a bit pointless, imho. A better addition would be including a free linker, such as ALINK and working out the dependencies of the user required features and then only linking the required object files (a bit like what my 'new' version does). For smaller installers, you may only need the ZLIB inflate code and a basic interface. I was also wondering whether generating machine code from makensis would be better in the long run as at the moment the 'IL' code at the end is pretty much perfectly decompilable (except you dont get function names etc)..<br />
