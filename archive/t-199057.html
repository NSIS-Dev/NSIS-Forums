<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">edolnx</div><div class="date">12th November 2004, 08:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a network administrator and deploying software to Windows systems is, well, difficult.  Way back in my academia years I had access to a copy of Installer WISE which would &quot;reverse engineer any installer&quot;.  They still have this feature, but the $1200 price tag is a bit of a put off, and I know others need the same capabilities for less money.<br />
<br />
What this feature did was it would take a snapshot of the current registry, enviroment, filesystem listings, and then quit.  At this point you would go and do whatever you want: change settings, install software, download documents, etc.  Many reboots later, you would launch the snapshot system again and it would take a snapshot again and diff them and build an installer script for the diff which you could tweak.<br />
<br />
The idea is I can install software or adjust system settings, then deploy a silent installer through the login scripts.<br />
<br />
Does NSIS have a plugin/related application/etc that could do something like this?  I'm I hoping for a miracle?  Any input would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could check out PC Magazine's InCtrl5 utility which does just that, for a lot less money ($5.97, actually :-)), and then see if you can parse the report file that it generates:<br />
