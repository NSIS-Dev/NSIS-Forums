<br />
What's the status of the UAC plug-in?http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in <br />
<br />
I think it might solve some Vista problems.  However the wiki page indicates that it's in an alpha stage.  My company is reluctant to let me include it in a solution due to its status.  Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />

<br />
At our company, we've been using the UAC plugin for our software installer and updater.  So far, we haven't had a single report of any problems.  This includes hundreds of customers<br />
<br />
Though, customers don't seem to point out errors as often as we'd like, so I can't guarantee that every single one functioned without error.  But still, it seems to be woring well.  Plus from all the heavy testing I did (I was the one who documented some of the UAC plugin and all the test cases), I don't spend any time worrying about it now.<br />
<br />
It's Anders plugin, so he gets to make the call.  But I'd say because of the testing, I'd rate it as beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 02:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what to say really, it is/was a pet project/ POC to show how to start a Medium IL process from a elevated setup. It will probably never reach 1.0 or stable if you will. Still, I am not aware of any real issues other than the fact that it does not report status in the nsis log window. Don't take alpha status to seriously, I can even change it to beta if it makes you feel better ;) Anyway, if you don't want to use the plugin, the only other alternative I can think of is to not start your app from a elevated setup (Disable run checkbox on finish page and whatnot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">edch</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to everyone for the quick reply; very nice forum.  As to taking the alpha status too seriously, well corporations have their rules.  I appreciate the time and effort that went into providing a solution to what, as far as I can tell, many developers are dealing with.<br />
<br />
After evaluating options, we decided to not deal with individual user profiles during installation, but instead create individual user resources as needed during application start-up.</div></div><hr />
