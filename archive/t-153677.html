<br />
I wrote an external dll that checks for NTFS file system and changes the security permissions for files and folders(under win XP,NT,2000).<br />
<br />
evrey thing looks fine and works fine on all windows versions except win98 . i use the MUI and on the MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_DIRECTORY_LEAVE i check the drive for file system :<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$PLUGINSDIR&quot;<br />
File &quot;..\..\..\nsis\projects\TakeOwnership\TakeOwnership.dll&quot;<br />
strcpy $3 $INSTDIR 3<br />
System::Call '$PLUGINSDIR\TakeOwnership.dll::IsNTFS(t &quot;$3&quot;) i .r4'<br />
<br />
using the dll on win98 causes the setup to crash , not after calling the dll but after exiting the event. after this event call i go directly to the install file windows , if i use the same code in another event like MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_INSTFILES_PRE<br />
i get the same result . if use the code within the copy section the setup crash when it reaches SetShellVarContext all(???) .<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any pointers for we , how do i work around this problem ? <br />
<br />
I used BCB5(Borland C++ Builder) to build the dll , working on winXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd October 2003, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">First try to convert this DLL to a real NSIS plug-in (see Contrib\ExDLL). That way we can be sure this crash has nothing to do with the System plug-in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm saying that because the majority of my bcb programs would run fine on NT/2000 machines but under 98 they would bork due to issues with buffer sizes, etc that the NT/2000 OSes deal better with.<br />
<br />
just my experience on things and may be of help<br />
