<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tcmichals</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 00:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm creating an installer which puts files into a fixed directory.  But I want the user to see where the files are being added. So I'm using the following fixed menu's:<br />
<br />
  !define MUI_WELCOMEPAGE<br />
  !define MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE<br />
	 !define MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_SMALLDESC<br />
<br />
  !define MUI_FINISHPAGE<br />
   !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
But when the MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE is completed it goes onto the FINISHEDPAGE, would like the user to to see this, for exmaple, user must use next to goto the finished page. The program I'm installing is small, so the MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE, just flashes.  <br />
<br />
I'm very new to NIS, is there a simple way of adding a next? or user button for user input to go to the finished page?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) You want do add a custom page between the COMPONENTS and FINISH pages? 2) Want to stay in the in the COMPONENTS page after clicking &quot;Install&quot; button, and when end, show the &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button? 3) Or want to show a page with informations about files being installed and, when finishes, stop, to user look and click &quot;Next &gt;&quot; to be in the FINISH page?<br />
<br />
Choose your option! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tcmichals</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, sorry for the misunderstanding, your are correct, I really would like, to have the user be able to see the MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES page.<br />
<br />
The  MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES page goes by really fast, due to the small number of isntall files. I would like for the page to have user input ie the next&gt; button on the page.  Then the user can see what files were installed and where. <br />
<br />
Is this a little clearer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, this is what I'm looking for....</div></div><hr />

If auto close is off the page you want to show will stay until the user clicks Next.</div></div><hr />
