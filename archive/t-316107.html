<br />
I am sure there is an obvious answer to this but I just can't figure it out :confused: <br />
<br />
How do you view the DetailsPrint output when using the MUI interface?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">9th January 2010, 00:49</div></div><div class="posttext">same place as always, on the instfiles page (unless you force the show details button to be hidden)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bludginozzie</div><div class="date">9th January 2010, 01:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank Anders, in hindsight I probably asked the wrong question.  Let me try again;<br />
<br />
I have an installer running but I am having problems with the JRE detection on 64bit machines.  I am using this script.<br />
<br />
JRE Dynamic Installer (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Java_Runtime_Environment_Dynamic_Installer) <br />
<br />
The script has DetailPrint statements that will tell me why the detection isn't working but I cannot figure out where to view them.  Is there a way to view them during the wizard pages?  Is there a better way to debug scripts?  The tutorial talks about a Log Window but my installer doesn't have a log window (at least that I know of).<br />
<br />
Any help in how best to debug scripts would be grately appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bludginozzie</div><div class="date">9th January 2010, 06:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up using MessageBox to debug this.  Probably not the right way but got the job done.  <br />
<br />
Also the problem with this plugin is that it's not 64 bit aware.  I added the following to my .onInit to resolve it;<br />
<br />
<br />
${If} ${RunningX64}<br />
    SetRegView 64<br />
${Else}<br />
    SetRegView 32<br />
${Endif}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">11th January 2010, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">${If} ${RunningX64}<br />
    SetRegView 64<br />
${Else}<br />
    SetRegView 32<br />
${Endif}<br />
 <br />
You should only do this if you want to create registry entries for a 64 bit application. Never use 64 bit registry for a 32 bit application. (NSIS and NSIS installers are 32 bit applications.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bludginozzie</div><div class="date">11th January 2010, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that info.  I am building a dual installer that will install a 32bit and 64bit version of the app.  I was wondering how I can change the installer to a 64bit exe but I guess you have just answered that for me.<br />
<br />
thanks again!</div></div><hr />
