<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seban</div><div class="date">12th October 2012, 09:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am trying to display the chosen components on a summary page. I use checkboxes to do this:<br />
${NSD_CreateCheckBox} 0 44u 100% 12u &quot;Component 1&quot;<br />
Pop $chkComp1<br />
${If} ${SectionIsSelected} ${Section1}<br />
${NSD_Check} $chkComp1<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
Is it possible to set the checkbox read-only? I did this with a textbox:<br />
${NSD_CreateText} 0 13u 100% 12u $(summary_text_path)<br />
Pop $txtPath<br />
SendMessage $txtPath ${EM_SETREADONLY} 1 0<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialogs_FAQ#How_to_create_a_Read-only_Text_control<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it seems not to work with checkboxes.<br />
<br />
Another idea I had was disabling the checkboxes (EnableWindow $chkComp1 0), but this grays out the boxes and the caption and I don't like the look of it.<br />
<br />
My third idea would be using images of checkboxes and putting them next to labels, but I think there is a better way to do this. <br />
<br />
Can someone help me out? Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not a good idea because the user can use Tab to access the control and then Space to change its state.<br />
<br />
If you want a read-only check box then I would advise disabling it. This is what the user expects and not having it disabled will probably result in people thinking it's a bug.<br />

That's a very good point. <br />
<br />
Now I'm going to create the checkboxes (disabled) with empty strings as caption and put labels next to them. Then the checkboxes are disabled, but the text remains black.<br />
<br />
Thanks to both of you for your help.</div></div><hr />

You could remove the WS_TABSTOP style from the checkbox</div></div><hr />
