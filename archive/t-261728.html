<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheHeartSmasher</div><div class="date">13th December 2006, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to create an installer the requires the following applications to be installed.<br />
<br />
On the first installation page these programs are listed with someway of showing they are already installed. (I would need some help doing this)<br />
<br />
If it is installed then the program has text under or beside it that says it is already installed.<br />
<br />
If the program is not installed the user can check it and it will be downloaded and installed.  (My problem is I do not know how to get an application to download and install.)<br />
================================<br />
Genuine Validator<br />
Windows Installer 3.1<br />
Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1<br />
Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 patch<br />
Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0<br />
Windows XP SP2 (If it is not installed already)<br />
<br />
Mozilla Firefox 2.0<br />
Adobe Flash 9<br />
Adobe Shockwave<br />
Windows Media Player 10<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
Quicktime<br />
<br />
EA Link<br />
Steam<br />
Teamspeak (linked to website due to their terms)<br />
================================<br />
<br />
Then I would like to have optional software like games that are downloaded from a zip file, extracted then installed.<br />
<br />
During the download I would like to show the progress of the download.<br />
<br />
But have the text or something beside the installed application name saying if it is installed already.  Giving the user the ability to redownload and install if the user wants to.<br />
<br />
Also how would I have the program do auto updates and have a notify icon show up by the clock?</div></div><hr />

There are a few more download plugins at wiki.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheHeartSmasher</div><div class="date">14th December 2006, 07:36</div></div><div class="posttext">How would I be able to make a program from the checkable options have something appear by them saying it is already installed and or up to date.<br />
<br />
How would I create an NSIS auto update application that detects if the software is out of date.  <br />
<br />
If it is it downloads and installs the software automatically?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">14th December 2006, 09:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Certainly, you're able to do all these things with NSIS.<br />
My opinion, start examining the included InstallOptions examples. Also find examples at wiki and here in this forum.  You'll learn how to create custom pages, put controls on them, change controls, and so on. After that, reading values from registry, finding and comparing files and file versions, and finaly set up and run the whole thing would be the easy part of the job.</div></div><hr />

As when I try to display the license file I get an error.</div></div><hr />
