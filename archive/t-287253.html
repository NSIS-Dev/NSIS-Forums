<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thegrinch</div><div class="date">20th February 2008, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am deploying several NSIS installers successfully since more than two years, but now I encountered a &quot;new&quot;, never seen before, error:<br />
<br />
After the welcome page, when changing to the license page, the installer suddenly skips, and disappears.<br />
<br />
The behaviour only occured on machines that did not have a copy of riched20.dll available.<br />
<br />
Is there any way how to make sure this problem cannot occur?<br />
I mean, either extract the file before it is needed (I don't know how to do this), or make NSIS link the produced exe-setup statically against the missing dll.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help in advance,<br />
<br />
best regards,<br />
thegrinch</div></div><hr />

I guess you could search/extract for a file within function .onInit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it should still work if the system has riched32.dll... Unless there's a bug in NSIS or something.</div></div><hr />

I unfortunately cannot look into that pc that brought the error. But the guy definitely said, the riched20.dll was mentioned in the message box.<br />
<br />
Concerning this .oninit thing, I never had to use this function. Could you give an example, please?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help in advance,<br />

<br />
Could be the same as:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thegrinch</div><div class="date">21st February 2008, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">no, I did not. I actually don't even use the onInit function. Would installing (or: making sure, it is installed) in .onInit be possible? I mean, it's a question at which time the riched20.dll is loaded.<br />
<br />
kind regards,<br />

<br />
To me it seems that the the system isn't missing riched20.dll, but the riched20.dll is corrupted or something. Googling quickly reveals that corrupted riched20.dll file isn't that far-fetched that it may sound.</div></div><hr />
