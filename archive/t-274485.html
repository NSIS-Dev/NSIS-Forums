<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">17th July 2007, 02:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm wondering if it is possible to work out which version of windows is installed on a machine.<br />
<br />
I am trying to make an installer which works for Windows Mobile and also Windows SmartPhone Edition. But to do this i need to be able to tell which version the connected device has.<br />
<br />
The registry seems similar to a desktop PC registry. So if the windows version info is stored on Desktop PC's I would think there is a good chance it is on a PDA aswell.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">17th July 2007, 05:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I did try that, what I've found in the last couple of hours is that the none of the keys that are found on a desktop pc in the CurrentVersion folder to tell u the operating system actually exist on PDA registry.<br />
<br />
So, I've found another key which I'm going to try and use to tell me which version to install.<br />
<br />
Located:<br />
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\User Agent\Post Platform\<br />
<br />
Basically, in this key there is a string which has info about what model device it is.<br />
<br />
But usually contains Either &quot;PPC&quot; for pocket PC's or &quot;Smartphone&quot; for Smartphones.<br />
<br />
I will try and use these, an if they can't give me a definite answer i will prompt the user to choose.</div></div><hr />
