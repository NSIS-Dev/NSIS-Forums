<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClayDowling</div><div class="date">3rd December 2007, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Last week I had to install a bunch of patches for a commercial development tool.  Each of those patches (there were 6 in all) required that I re-enter the registration information.  That got really old, and I got to thinking about how to make the Registration plugin avoid that hassle.<br />
<br />
I've come up with an answer that I think would be generally useful, whether you use the Registration plugin or your own custom solution.  The full article is at the registration plugin website (http://www.lazarusid.com/software-updates-example.html), but it comes down to this:<br />
<br />
1. Store your registration information in a known location.<br />
<br />
2. Before displaying the registration screen, check the stored information to see if the software is already registered, and abort the screen if it is.<br />
<br />
Not rocket science, but I spent a few hours putting it together so that my own customers of the registration plugin wouldn't have to deal with the hassle.</div></div><hr />
