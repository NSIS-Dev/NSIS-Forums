<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oldfriend</div><div class="date">23rd June 2012, 01:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Question is pretty simple. Is there any zip extracting pug-in which works in Unicode? As i could make sure ZIPDLL, nsUnZip and even 7zip don't work with Unicode? <br />
<br />
Is it true NSIS is not used in Unicode? I hope someone has encountered this problem and solved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oldfriend</div><div class="date">23rd June 2012, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anybody explain why zipdll extracts fine file in English, Italian and Portuguese languages and doesn't extract at all (with error) in all the other languages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oldfriend</div><div class="date">24th June 2012, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevertheless, on the page of ZipDLL there is declared that it supports Unicode, but those who tried most probably found that it doesn't.<br />
<br />
I found nothing about working with zip packages in Unicode on the whole forum. Even this tread was left with no answer. <br />
<br />
I had no other choice but to rewrite sources. For those who need to use macro<br />
!insertmacro ZIPDLL_EXTRACT SOURCE DESTINATION FILE<br />
<br />
Now it works in Unicode, just copy it to the plugins directory. I did nothing with other functions so probably in Unicode they still don't work. Actually I'm not sure if even this attachment is needed since after so many years nobody carried about this. Anyway, here it is.</div></div><hr />

I don't see anything related to unicode on http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in</div></div><hr />

Yes, probably you are right, and I had confused it with the ZipArchive which is part of ZipDLL</div></div><hr />

You'll be happy to know that you've helped at least one poor soul.<br />
I've had the same problem with using zipDLL with unicode nsis, and your revised dll works perfect !!<br />
Thank you<br />
