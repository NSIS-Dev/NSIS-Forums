Sorry for barging in like that. <br />
The problem is i have a program here that I made the installer for with nsis, but it turns out it'll only run if the application's launcher is executed with administration status. Can I do that with NSIS or do I have to go back to the programmers with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">7th July 2011, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand that you want your installed application to always be executed as admin. Is this correct? If it is, then the problem lies not with NSIS but with the application. The app itself should check its own execution level, and throw an error when it's not admin.<br />

If you want to create a shortcut that runs a certain exe As Admin, check this thread: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=319628</div></div><hr />
