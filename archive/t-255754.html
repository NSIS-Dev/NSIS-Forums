<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">6aklan</div><div class="date">18th September 2006, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">How to set DEFAULT file association? If an extenstion was previously set to Notepad (by default), and I create a new association with my installer, the Notepad is still in the &quot;Recommended Programs&quot; list for that file extension. My application is added to that list too, but the name of the app is let's say &quot;ZZZ&quot;, and it is on the last place in the list. So my extension is always open with Notepad, until I precisely check &quot;Always use the selected program&quot; for my installed application.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to set my program as the &quot;default&quot; one during setup? I searched through NSIS forums and MSDN, but still could not find an appropriate registry key...</div></div><hr />

The only reason I can think of, is that some other program is restoring the extension's handler class.</div></div><hr />
