<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gato Muerto</div><div class="date">29th June 2006, 20:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a method by which NSIS can detect the short filename of a path that a software is installed to?  <br />
<br />
I am attempting to repackage an existing program that requires path information to be placed in ini files in order to run correctly.  Apparently one of the lines has to be in the 8.3 format.  I know that this is not as simple as converting the path to 8.3, and was wondering if anyone knows how to detect the $INSTDIR after installation has completed.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

I have been using NSIS for a year now and I still keep coming up to new things that I have never heard about before.  Keeps reminding me that this is pretty damn nifty, and I don't know nearly as much as I thought I did.</div></div><hr />
