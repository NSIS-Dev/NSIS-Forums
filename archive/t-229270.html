Thanks for NSIS.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I met some people on a &quot;MDSN Tech-Talk&quot;, which gave me a reference to NSIS.<br />
<br />
I tried to build a setup for one of my smaller applications by borrowing some code from the examples and using the wizard of the &quot;HM NIS Editor&quot;.<br />
<br />
It took no whole day to make it work.<br />
Another day was needed for a nice look'n feel.<br />
I took a third day for a multilingual setup.<br />
<br />
Because of this I decided to built a setup for a bigger application <br />
which was shipped with a setup made by InstallShield Developer.<br />
<br />
Now I'm looking for a tutorial which guides me through the setup creation with NSIS. <br />
Something like &quot;NSIS for dummies&quot; or &quot;NSIS Step by Step&quot; would be nice.<br />
<br />
The new setup has to detect the old InstallShield installations of my application and uninstall them.<br />
It should also look for the .NET framework on the target system and install it if necessary. <br />
(I found some ideas here and on the wiki and I will try with them.)<br />
<br />
I would be grateful for further references.</div></div><hr />
