<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">i was wondering what to expect from the beta-status of nsis and what the differences to previous alpha versions are.<br />
<br />
does beta-status mean, that the current features will remain, or will there be such major changes within the structure as in the previous alphas? the ModernUI script was changed with every new alpha-build. could this still apply to future betas and the final, or will the changes be minor (bugfixes?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">It does not mean that we won't add new features. For example, LZMA compression is on the TODO list.<br />
<br />
I does mean that NSIS 2 is quite stable now, so you can use it for all your installers.<br />
<br />
Beta 0 includes Modern UI 1.61. I have no plans for Modern UI updates at the moment. Because of the new macro system, most updates in the future won't break up older scripts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">the ModernUI script was changed with every new alpha-build.<br />
<br />
Modern UI was introduced with alpha 7 and changed drasitcally with b0. All of the changes that you are talking about are in the CVS version. That's the price you have to pay if you want to use the latest version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, but the Modern UI will not be updated that often anymore, and most of the changes will not break up older scripts :) So even if you want to use the latest development versions, you won't have to update your scripts every other day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RIV@NVX</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">But it still says NSIS 2.0b0 in the left down corner and when I compile the script...<br />
But, I see 2.0b1 in changelog.<br />
Nice work, kichik and Joost. You made NSIS the really nice installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">That's because I didn't upload a version with the new string yet.<br />

<br />
When are you going to upload it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">The source has already been uploaded. A new makensis and InstallOptions compile will probably be uploaded tomorrow, when Modern UI 1.62 is ready (bugfixes and some small new features, no changed required in the scripts).</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK. Language changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, no scripts or language files need to be updated :)<br />
<br />
This is the changelog so far. Still need to fix some small issues.<br />

* Default state of checkboxes on the finish page can be changed <br />
* Welcome / Finish pages compatible with custom DPI settings</div></div><hr />
