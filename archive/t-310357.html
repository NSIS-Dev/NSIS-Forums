<br />
my installer incorporates a number of different options (nothing new, I guess...). As a result, in some cases MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN is to be set, in some cases it isn't. This decision is to be made at run-time (there is no way to do this at compile-time).<br />
<br />
- I tried to set MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN = &quot;&quot;, but this only leads to an empty command; the button is displayed anyway.<br />
- I also tried to !undef MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN, but that is not conditional to run-time result either.<br />
<br />
Is there another way to do so?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />

I just ran into this exact situation last week. I am using MUI2, so I was able to do this.<br />
<br />
I did this for my finish page:<br />
<br />
<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;$FinishEXE&quot;<br />
!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_SHOW ShowFunction_Finish<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
<br />
<br />
$FinishEXE is the variable that holds the full path to the executable I want to run off of the Finish page. If it is a quit or an abort, I set $FinishEXE to &quot;&quot;.<br />
<br />
The MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_SHOW in this case is after the dialog items are rendered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Function ShowFunction_Finish<br />
<br />
    ${If} $FinishEXE == &quot;&quot;<br />
        ;no value, thus uncheck and hide the run checkbox<br />
        ${NSD_Uncheck} $mui.FinishPage.Run<br />
        ShowWindow $mui.FinishPage.Run ${SW_HIDE}<br />
    ${EndIf}<br />
<br />
FunctionEnd ;ShowFunction_Finish<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
