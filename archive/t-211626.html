<br />
I just did a search for this, but couldn't find anything recent on it...<br />
<br />
I just installed HM NIS Edit 2.03 and the ran the wizard.  I couldn't get past the 2nd screen where you specify the setup language (setup lang).  I had to install versin 2.0 and then re-install 2.03 for the languages to appear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I thought I'd share that for others.  Or is there a better place to report this bug?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrby</div><div class="date">29th March 2005, 02:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Andrew, I for one appreciate this info as I was about to install 2.0.3 myself!<br />
<br />
Having said thanks, I'll now say that you ought to post<br />
this to the HM Nis Editor developer.<br />
<br />
Go to  the main HM Nis page: http://hmne.sourceforge.net/<br />
and then click on &quot;Project Page&quot;, then click on &quot;Bugs&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abcdgoldfish</div><div class="date">5th June 2009, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I see this conversation took place four years ago but I am just trying to run HM NIS 2.0.3 and have encountered the same problem.  I would have followed the URL provided by Arrby but all I see is &quot;URL submitted by user&quot; instead of a link.  Could someone help me here?<br />
<br />
Some further info: I used HM NIS about six months ago to create an installer and it worked fine.  Since then my machine was reimaged and I lost that code.  I just downloaded it and installed it again but now I have this problem.  I have also tried this on several other machines, XP, Vista, all with no luck.  This is the code I downloaded:<br />

<br />
you can click the quote button of a post to find the masked link.<br />
<br />
In this case it's http://hmne.sourceforge.net/ which you already used to download.<br />
<br />
I can't help you with the problem, but you can still download the previous versions of HM NIS, so you can try the solution mentioned before.</div></div><hr />
