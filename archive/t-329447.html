<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hphantom</div><div class="date">9th April 2011, 05:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I just started learning NSIS, and I wanted to ask a couple of questions.<br />
<br />
1 - Is it possible to create a loop to remove/make blank all of the page header subtext, rather than defining: !define MUI_PAGE_HEADER_SUBTEXT '' for each page?<br />
2 - For only the welcome page, where the &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button is all the way at the bottom of the installer, I wanted to create a checkbox to the left of it where the user has an option to check it to go to the advance installation. Is there a way to do this with/out a plugin (am guessing nsDialogs? I haven't quite mastered the .ini file)? I tried ${NSD_CreateCheckbox} but then realised it would only align itself within the main section, rather than going to the footer of the installer.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for any/all input!</div></div><hr />

1: No, but you can edit the MUI nsh files to change them to &quot;&quot;. But why would you want to do this? What's so bad about putting a define in your scripts? They're all compiletime instructions, so it doesn't matter for eventual installer size or whatever.<br />
<br />
2: The Next etc buttons are outside of the page space, so to edit it you'll have to edit the interface. You'll need to use resource editor for that (search the forums). But what you're suggesting is not really compliant with how wizard installers are supposed to look, and it's probably much easier to just create a custom page (nsDialogs).</div></div><hr />

Short version is: very lazy. I figure if all of the sub_text require the same event happening, it'd be a smarter move to just loop through all of them rather than one at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd add the check box to the welcome page itself. You can do this using nsDialogs.<br />
and it's probably much easier to just create a custom page (nsDialogs).<br />
I'll give this a shot, thought might be something else as a checkbox would be in the center of the page, not at the bottom; sounds like I have some fun ahead of me!<br />
<br />
Thanks guys~!</div></div><hr />

You can find the control id's by opening up Contrib\UIs\modern.exe (dialog 105) in Resource Hacker.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hphantom</div><div class="date">10th April 2011, 03:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I made my custom Welcome page which is looking how I want to (custom colors ftw), but I still can't seem to figure out how to get the checkbox to show up instead of the cancel. I tried not showing the cancel and replacing with a checkbox, and didn't figure that out. This is what I have now:nsDialogs::CreateControl BUTTON ${BS_AUTOCHECKBOX}|${WS_VISIBLE}|${WS_CHILD}|${WS_TABSTOP}|${WS_EX_WINDOWEDGE}|${WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE} 0 100 320 170 15 &quot;Custom installation&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried coding the Y to go off the edge of the main section into where the cancel is, but that didn't work either. Any ideas? Thank you~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T.Slappy</div><div class="date">10th April 2011, 06:17</div></div><div class="posttext">It is impossible to add component apart from inner dialog area!<br />
Window cannot hadle events outside of it's rect. For nsDialogs this rect is 300*140 (ID 1018 or 1044)<br />
Try adding checkbox manually using ResHacker and hide it on next page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">10th April 2011, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hence why I said add it to the welcome page itself. The outer dialog is NOT part of the welcome page. You cannot modify it using nsDialogs. As said already, if you must have it next to the navigation buttons (i.e. the outer dialog / $HWNDPARENT) then add it to the UI using resource hacker. Also, when working with nsDialogs, use the macros (i.e. ${NSD_Create*}.<br />

Yop, this is correct way, I said the same in other words, sorry I overlooked your post Afrow UK :)</div></div><hr />
