<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dajvid</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 04:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a quick excerpt from the Users Manual (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter2.html#2.4):<br />
<br />
NSIS supports different compression methods zlib and bzip2. zlib is fast and is very efficient in resources consumption. bzip2 usually gives better results for large installers, but requires a bit more memory and is a little slower. <br />
<br />
From my own (non-comprehensive) experiences, it depends on your target machines and the archive you're creating. For example, I hit problems where I was extracing a ~40 Mb file using bzip2 on a Pentium 266 with 64Mb. This file took a significant amount of time to extract and somehow threw the timing of the setup script. Recompiling with zlib improved speed, and more importantly, didn't break the script. The same machine, however, is quite happy with ~20Mb files using bzip2.<br />
<br />
Without any further exploration of the issue, if you've got big archives running on slow machines, you might want to consider zlib, otherwise I usually use bzip2.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
Dave.</div></div><hr />

The reason bzip2 is not used by default, I think, is because bzip2 needs to uncompress all of the files in the installer, so that if a section is not selected by the user it will still have to be uncompressed, thus making the installer slower than zlib one if not all of the files are always installed.<br />

I have an issue where I redistribute an Installshield installer, using NSIS to launch the installshield installer with an &quot;answer file&quot;...I get almost no compression because Installshield has already compressed most of the files into the data.cab file.<br />
<br />
The result is that if I use Bzip, the installer is (I think) about 40kb larger than if I use zlib.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">27th July 2003, 05:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You could use the command line extract.exe or a specialised program such as WinAce, WinRAR, etc.<br />
