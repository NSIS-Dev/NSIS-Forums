So far the info I have is that he is using Win2k and that the crash happens after: Selecting &quot;English&quot; in the lang dialog -&gt; Clicks next past Welcome screen -&gt; crashes before license screen.<br />
<br />
I can not reproduce this bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">20th November 2003, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the latest version (NSIS 2 beta 4)?<br />
<br />
Can you attach the script?<br />
<br />
Can you post all code and details in the crash dialog?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th November 2003, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming you are talking about 0.72's installer, I can not reproduce this either. The script part for this seems pretty generic, so nothing should be wrong at that end. The two details that are needed to check out what's wrong are the exact text of the crash dialog and the exact version of the makensis.exe used (CVS version if not an alpha/beta release point). If it is 0.72's installer, then it would be also useful if you can give him an installer compiled with b4 final and let him test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hermanator</div><div class="date">20th November 2003, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">He has this problem with 0.72 which uses a NSIS cvs version from 7/20/03 and with a more recent build using an updated nsis script with NSIS cvs 11/18/03 (I assume that would be r1.250).  Do you have a debug build that would be of some use? I'll build a new b4 final version for him to test in the mean time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th November 2003, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no debug version, the resource editor still doesn't support those. Code offset along with the exact number of version used (registers are useful too if possible) should be enough to pinpoint the problem.<br />
<br />
The NSIS package installer is pretty similar in that part of the script so it would be a good if he can test that too.</div></div><hr />
