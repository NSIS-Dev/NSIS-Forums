<br />
I do like the way you have the set up of your Zip2Exe, but its missing a feather that I would just love to see. (and due to me being a noob to NSIS i use it lots more then makeing my own Scrip files.)<br />
<br />
This is a screen shot of what i am using now for all of my Zip2Exe needs.<br />
<br />
*NOTE THAT* THE HKCU\softwear\valve\steam\ModInstallDir as this as its value ...<br />

<br />
If you want to make a better installer from using zip2exe, you can add NSIS code to the NSIS\Contrib\zip2exe\Modern.nsh file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">16th July 2004, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that will required more coding that equals biggers size of the header...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">17th July 2004, 01:39</div></div><div class="posttext">that's kinda how pimpbot (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=323)  works. i have plans to release the sourcecode, but first i want to overwork the structure, so people can easily modify it for their needs. guess that is going to become pimpbot v3.<br />
<br />
btw, pimpbot itself is written in nsis :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">17th July 2004, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you could make that with NSIS. If you're going to put a progressbar, you have to use InstallOptionsEx. Buttons that have text w/ images and Header control for the files (which is essential) aren't supported by InstallOptionsEx.<br />
<br />
Now, if it is going to be implementated... you have to make it. Because, you know, NSIS has lots of feature requests already and will be a long time before it gets implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">17th July 2004, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, but i always prefered WinRAR or<br />
something like this (real archiver)<br />
instead any somehow-solution.<br />
Archiver are specialists like NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">17th July 2004, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">as i have most of the code from pimpbot already, i've decided to work on something like that.<br />
<br />
however, since i'm completely unexperienced with validate-functions, i could need some help one this. i know there's a pretty good example coming with nsis, do i have to mind anything syntax-wise when using mui?<br />
<br />
i guess i could complete the task within august.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">17th July 2004, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to create these validate functions by now, and if you do, you don't have a lot of them to create anyways. It's a wizard type program, like yours, so it doesn't have to have lots of things changing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">17th July 2004, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">as you suggested i want to validate the inputs of the file/directory dialogs and disable some controls dynamically. however, kichik pointed me in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dygear</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 01:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all very much for the replies i will be looking into pimpbot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dygear</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 01:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a posable mod that could be made to pimpbot to allow it to be geared more like the &quot;zip2exe&quot; or &quot;dir2exe&quot; that I showed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 03:54</div></div><div class="posttext">as i said, not yet. but i plan to do that, based on pimpbot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dygear</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well man people are waiting :P.<br />
Thanks for the help, and I hope for a speedy version of &quot;zip2exe&quot; &quot;dir2exe&quot;.</div></div><hr />
