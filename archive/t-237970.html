<br />
Ive reading the forums here and looking at a few scripts and have decided to take the plunge.<br />
<br />
I dont do many installers and when i do i have always used InnoSetup for it and whilst its an awesome product i think NSIS may be even better.<br />
<br />
As with the grip of some people here the syntax is horrible and the docs arent the best, however the forum seems to make up for that with its skilled members.<br />
<br />
So im going to stick with NSIS and try to learn it and come back with a more detailed report sometime soon.<br />
<br />
Something i noticed on a few scripts out there in the uninstall section was -<br />
<br />
RMDir /r &quot;$INSTDIR\*.*&quot;<br />
RMDir &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
Isnt that absolute madness? because as soon as someone installs into say x:\Program Files\ with no APP FOLDER name, on uninstall its going to be HORRIBLE :)<br />
<br />
Theres probably a few more traps for the unexperienced too.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
Sissy</div></div><hr />

However, RMDir /r &quot;$INSTDIR\*.*&quot; would be very nasty if $INSTDIR got set to program files or windows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">16th February 2006, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps NSIS should include a check that dangerous commands like RmDir do not operate on Special folders like $PROGRAMFILES, $DESKTOP, $STARTMENU, $WINDIR, etc.<br />
Or if it does, automatically popup a warning to the user and give them a chance to cancel the setup or uninstaller.</div></div><hr />
