<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rnvagh</div><div class="date">2nd January 2008, 05:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created an installer which asks for serial number and i have used two ways to get serial number but both of them have different problems...<br />
<br />
    1) I have used the following<br />
<br />
       PassDialog::Dialog Serial  \                              <br />
             /HEADINGTEXT 'Please enter the serial code...' \<br />
             /CENTER             \<br />
             /BOXDASH 15 70 5 '' \<br />
             /BOXDASH 95 70 5 '' \<br />
             /BOXDASH 175 70 5 ''   \<br />
             /BOXDASH 255 70 5 ''    \<br />
             /BOX 335 70 5 ''<br />
<br />
       it works fine but, problem is that i am not able to resize the groupbox and the reason to resize the groupbox is that the unrequired space does not look good as the our company client requirements.<br />
<br />
     2) I have used custom page but in that i am not able to automatically change the focus to the textboxes as they reach at their MaxLen.<br />
<br />
         I want that when i enter 5 digits/characters in first textbox then the cursor should be set into second textbox and so on...<br />
<br />
       Everythink works other than this...<br />
<br />
       Please help me,<br />
<br />
       Thanks,<br />

You should be able to achieve this with lately added nsDialogs plugin.</div></div><hr />

Hey, Red Wine, you didn't look at my code :) <br />
Indeed you're right, moreover, the keyboard is not my best bet ;)</div></div><hr />
