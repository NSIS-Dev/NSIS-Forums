<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justabhai</div><div class="date">8th August 2006, 05:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am inserting a custom page in my installer and uninstaller. It works fine if I extract the custom installer page in .onInit and custom uninstaller page in un.onInit.<br />
<br />
Am I doing right? Or is it like I have to do some other way, but this works as well.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I am trying to add an icon and a banner (bitmap) to the finish page (which is also a custom page). The custom finish page appears fine in the installer but doesn't appear in the uninstaller. The uninstaller's title and subtitle appears but custom finish page (.ini) doesn't get displayed.<br />
<br />
Is it like you cannot insert a custom finish page?<br />
<br />
Thirdly, I am adding the &quot;text&quot; of the &quot;label&quot; to the custom finish page using MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE. But no text appears on the installer page.<br />
<br />
Can't I just write to the label at runtime?<br />
<br />
And lastly, does anyone how to make a section (group box) to appear (visible) using the value of a checkbox. Initially I want to it to appear as invisble and then depending on the state of the checkbox want it appear. I can use disable but that disables the groupbox but it still appears on the screen.<br />
<br />
Your help is appreciated.<br />
<br />

<br />
1). Yes, this is the right way to extract a custom page .ini.<br />
<br />
2). Check to make sure you are giving installoptions the correct path, and make sure the file exists. Also make sure the pages are ordered correctly, and make sure installoptions is being called in the pre function of the custom pages.<br />
<br />
3). You have to write to it before the page is displayed. Make sure you write to it before using any of the installoptions macros.<br />
<br />
4). I have no idea. I don't use the components page in my installers. I did a bit of research and it appears you can't hide a section, then show it. I might be wrong.</div></div><hr />
