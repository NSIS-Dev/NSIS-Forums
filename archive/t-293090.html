<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">13th June 2008, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have a question/comment about FileRead.<br />
<br />
I have a file of data that is NOT binary data, but I do NOT want to parse it on a line by line basis either, but instead grab chunks of the file at various offsets as needed.<br />
<br />
The problem is that FileRead will read up to a CRLF, and then return with that set of data regardless of the value of [maxlen] that I provide to the FileRead command.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is for FileRead to have an option to simply ignore CRLF, and just return up to [maxlen] data that I provide to the command, OR, if the file is at EOF, return whatever data there is up until EOF.<br />
<br />
So what I have done as a patch, is change FileRead to allow for negative values in [maxlen].<br />
If a negative value is passed in, we mark a flag to tell it to NOT quit reading after finding a CRLF, but instead to keep going until maxlen is reached, or we run into the end of the file.<br />
<br />
This patch works well, and I would like to submit it, to hopefully be taken.<br />
<br />
However, I am thinking instead of overriding the functionality of FileRead, maybe I should make a new command?<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">13th June 2008, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I thought of that, but there are 2 problems with doing it that way...<br />
<br />
1) The FileReadByte translates the byte read into an integer.  <br />
&gt; The byte is stored in the output as an integer (0-255).<br />
<br />
2) I need to read very relatively large data files.  Probably 10 M's or larger.<br />
Calling that function, and reading each BYTE by BYTE is going to be horribly inefficient, and converting each integer read back into a string is even more horribly inefficient.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had thought of making a new command called FileReadBytes that would take an optional [maxsize] parameter, but since FileReadByte does the BYTE -&gt; int transalation, it seems like I should stay away from that name, since my new function would NOT translate the data read.</div></div><hr />

To prevent that, call your function from within a function which itself is called from within a section.<br />
You can use IntFmt $out %c $in to convert the ASCII value to a character. Don't forget you are only limited to 1023 characters in NSIS (or 8191 if using the special build).<br />
