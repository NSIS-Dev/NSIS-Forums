<br />
I am trying to use it for people to be able to install files to a game directory because the new directory structure is very complicated for the end user and I believe this can make things a lot more pleasant for them.<br />
<br />
Basically there are two to three files involved in this process. they all go into different directories but these directories are all located in My Documents, and there is a user name in the string i cannot predict.<br />
<br />
base directory is located here: C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3\UTGame<br />
<br />
Files need to go here: C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3\UTGame\Config<br />
<br />
here: C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3\UTGame\Published\CookedPC\Script<br />
<br />
and sometimes here: C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3\UTGame\Published\CookedPC<br />
<br />
I have no clue how to get past the user name part i tried adding \..\ and also \[user]\ in the path but it didn't work , and I have not been able to find any answers (for nubes) ;) any help is greatly appreciated.<br />
