<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ron.Stordahl</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to cause the installer at runtime to pause for a specific length of time,at the spot in the code where I insert it, 1 second might do it, and then resume.  Ideally this would give no indication that it was occurring, but I could accept a messagebox with text that I could specify, however it should not require user action for it to continue, i.e. it should expire after a specified length of time.  Ill go into the reason for this later, but for the moment I will say that I am getting random install errors, which are completely eliminated by simply providing the delay associated with a simple message box.  For now I need the above function to fully test the issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ron.Stordahl</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks...that works.  I should have been able to find this myself.  Part of the problem is that I search the documents using the NSIS menu which itself calls up Microsoft's atrocious Help system.  What I want to do is to have the documents in a format in which I could search using something better, for example an editor like NotePad++.  With that I could have found the command in the docs!  <br />
<br />
So, can you suggest how I could better search the docs to find things!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The .chm has both a index &quot;keyword&quot; lookup and a text search feature, the other alternative is the online (SVN) html docs: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ron.Stordahl</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't aware of the online docs at SourceForge, that will help.  However what would be better would be a means of searching them with a single command.  For example a flat form of the docs.  There is probably a better way, I just don't know exactly how to express it.  Maybe there is some format to do a Google like search of the documents which wouldn't require an exact match.  Those of you very familiar with the NSIS documents hardly need this, you have it more or less memorized, but for one who uses NSIS only occasionally I am finding it difficult to find what it already there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">You can grab the raw doc source files from http://nsis.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/nsis/NSIS/tags/v246/Docs/src/ and search those, or use halibut to convert it to some other format...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">17th October 2011, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that 99% of all the commands I need are runtime commands, and they're all in chapter 4 of the manual:  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html<br />
<br />
Only very rarely need I look in other places, and in those cases I usually already know where to look (either chapter 5 or appendix E).</div></div><hr />
