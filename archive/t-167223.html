<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an intro sound that plays but as soon as the splash<br />
screen leaves the sound cuts straight away and the control is given back to the user.......<br />
Is there a way to start the sound and let it finish and have<br />
the program still work like normal ?<br />
So the installer is still functional. ????????<br />
Such as a Background playing music function ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To play a background sound use the BgImage plug-in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">30th January 2004, 03:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thiking on having the sound play while the<br />
FAT huge install was rollin and have some kind of ani play<br />
hehe....... as to give someone somthing to do while<br />
the sucker installs ;)<br />
<br />
well when i get this install done or mabey in the proccess<br />
I can figure out the DLL stuff<br />
mabey i could play Mp3 and High Quilty Wav or Divx :)<br />
no that would be frekin Sweet.<br />
<br />
Actually I could do it if i new the how the API calls work in Nsis when calling window routines.<br />
<br />
so if i called system32.dll and such<br />
yeah somthing like that could allow me to call a system function and or do a registry check and return weather to play the file or not :)</div></div><hr />
