<br />
in my Installer in some circumstances i need to start a other application, cause this other application has amongst other things also a setup routine which i couldn't clone inside my installer. I'm starting the other App with ExecWait and all work will be done inside .onInit.<br />
<br />
This other application does not only do the described installer work (it will start MSIEXEC with for me unknown parameters and is doing something) - it starts immediately after. And this is the Problem! The user now has to quit the application, because it's not ready, cause now i have to do other tings inside my installer.<br />
<br />
My wish is now to display a Message box ... or better something like a Bitmap or SplashScreen, which is modal in front of all other applications (called TopMost?) during the time, the external Application is running, so the veryvery EndUser can't forget it ...<br />
<br />
After quitting the external App, my installer will continue to do the rest of the work.<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />
