<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">16th December 2006, 02:16</div></div><div class="posttext">In searching NSIS for help with installing from multiple CD's, I came across CABSetup.  However, I am not completely comfortable with its warnings as my product is commercial.<br />
<br />
I am wondering what my options are and what NSIS users do in the case of multiple media.  If I put an installer on each CD (The bulk of my content is 3000 or more ogg and emf files.), does NSIS have a means for remembering the directory chosen or accepted by the user, thus enabling continued copying to the install directory without further prompting?<br />
<br />
And is it perhaps preferable to place such files outside the installer?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr Inches</div><div class="date">16th December 2006, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the warnings with CABSetup that concerned you for a commercial product?<br />
<br />
The only warning I know I put in for the suite was to exercise care if you run InstStub.exe outside of the suite since it will delete the file it runs, but that is it's job.<br />
<br />
The compatibility issues are there as a guide for installer authors to know what their installer needs to do around the plug-in i.e. check right Windows version, clean up if Inststub doesn't complete (it does return a non-zero errorlevel), etc.<br />

All of your posts that I read indicated to me that you are far more qualified than I am in these things.  But after five years of hard labor in my product, I steer clear of such risks and warnings.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, all of our current files will happily fit on one cd.</div></div><hr />
