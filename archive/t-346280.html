<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xmlnoob</div><div class="date">11th July 2012, 09:30</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm trying to replace some lines in the text file with linefind, i tried the combination of deleting lines then insert lines, using the examples listed in http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixE.html#E.2.2 .<br />
<br />
Inserting lines working fine, but delete lines always delete the first line of the file plus the line(s) i specified.   Another serious issue when using linefind to delete lines is that it drop all the lines wchinese characters.<br />
<br />
I'm using unicode nsis and the text file with chinese characters is encoded in utf-8.<br />
<br />
So any thought of what i'm doing wrong??  The code i used was exactly the same as shown in the example except for the filenames &amp; line numbers and of course the line i'm going to replace.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

There are many functions on the Wiki which do this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xmlnoob</div><div class="date">12th July 2012, 07:17</div></div><div class="posttext">also, any other precautions for messing with utf-8 + chinese characters?<br />
<br />
i tried other functions found in google, but they all drop chinese characters and delete the first line of the file.<br />
<br />
other than linefind, can i use filewrite + fileseek to delete a line from the file??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th July 2012, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">No as I said (but in a little greater detail):<br />
<br />
Open your file A<br />
Open new file B<br />
For each line in A<br />
Write to B unless line = line to delete<br />
Close A<br />
Close B<br />
Delete B<br />
Rename A -&gt; B<br />
<br />
