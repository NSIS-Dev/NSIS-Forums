<br />
I've got an installer which runs fine on my machine and several machines where it's run in some Admin account. However there are some hosts with specially limited account, like <br />
 - limited access to registry, <br />
 - can't use 'run' from 'Start' menu <br />
and lots of other restrictions. <br />
<br />
So, on these hosts, my installer hangs when changing from a custom to another custom page. Both of these pages have creator and leave functions, where the  creator uses InstallOptions dialogs, and leave functions reads the InstallOptions ini contents.<br />
Now, since I couldn't produce any evident on what could happened, I'd like to ask you to help to find ways or tools to discover why the installer hang. I mean such things like 'while reading a file' or 'reading a registry key'. Or like, getting some backtrace of the running process, I dont't know since haven't debugged yet on Windows.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Zoltan</div></div><hr />
