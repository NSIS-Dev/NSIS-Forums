<br />
in the file i downloaded was templates and instructions<br />
on how to make a portable app, well i didnt like the app that i was suppost to do it on, so i chose one of my own,<br />
<br />
i followed the instructions as carfully as i could, but when i go to compile it it has errors. i have got it to compile once but it didnt run, i spent 16 hours on it lastnight, got up first thing couldnt wait to have a go,but at half 12 last night and nothing working i got a little downheartend, i no rome wasnt built over night but i realy cant understand what im doing wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend that you download and try out this handy program:<br />
Quick Setup Script Generator (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Quick_Setup_Script_Generator). It was developed by a frequent poster here, Red Wine, and he often provides lots of good help to newbies.<br />
<br />
Since your problem script didn't get attached to your post, we can't provide specific advice about compile errors (or anything else either). I will give you two tips 1) if you have any logic at all in your script, use the logiclib header. And 2) NSIS scripts are processed by a 'one-pass' compiler and the order of items (functions, sections, pages) in the script is critical. The NSIS QSSG will create a good template (or finished installer) that you can edit to do exactly what you want it to do.<br />

As i said to you (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=2180516#post2180516), WE ONLY NEED NSI FILE.. :rolleyes: <br />

Again, we only need the NSI File to see what's wrong.. Does my microphone doesn't work? :weird:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">5th May 2007, 12:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you don't have file extensions on. Go to Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View in Windows Explorer (My Computer) and un-check 'Hide file extensions for known file types'. This is checked as default and is extremely stupid as it requires that less computer literate users identify files by their sometimes non-unique icons.<br />
<br />
The file in question will now have a .nsi appended to the end.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th May 2007, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">You are using functions of the Registry plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Registry_plug-in) in your script, but you don't include its header and you don't seem to have the plug-in itself somewhere available. It may be in the Plugins directory of your NSIS installation, but I can't see that from the file you attached.<br />
<br />
Your script compiles when I add !include &quot;Registry.nsh&quot; on the top, after installing the Registry plug-in. I don't know if it works though...</div></div><hr />
