<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRat</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">First I'd like to run around my computer room screaming &quot;WOOOHA, THIS IS THE GREATEST APPLICATION EVER CREATED&quot;, but I'll keep myself. Still, thanks alot to the creators for creating such a brilliant, FREE application!<br />
<br />
And now for my questions:<br />
<br />
#1 - Is it possible to &quot;add files&quot; to the compiled executable? Right now I have a dir where I have setup.exe, two zip files and license.txt, I'd like the three files to be &quot;loaded into&quot; setup.exe if possible. (Right now I extract the zip files using ZipDLL (Thanks for a great plugin!)<br />
<br />
#2 - Is there a simple way to log all files created/extracted during installation, so that a detailed uninstall can be created? (Unnecerary, but cosmeticly nice.)<br />
<br />
#3 - A little bit off topic maby, but is it possible to install apache as a service using NSIS? I have all the Apache files in a zip file, and I'd like to install the Apache service. (I'm talking about the Apache webserver, if anyone was wondering.)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for a great application!<br />

<br />
2) Well... You can either enable NSIS_CONFIG_LOG and recompile NSIS or create a little macro that will use FileWrite to write to a log and then, or before, call File.<br />
<br />
3) It should be possible, I have seen more than one user around here that have installed Apache as part of their package. If I remember correctly they extracted the files and then executed Apache with -i in the command line arugments.</div></div><hr />
