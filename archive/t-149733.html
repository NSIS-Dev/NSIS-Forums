<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">How come when I set DirText, the &quot;Destination Folder&quot; (MUI_INNERTEXT_DIRECTORY_DESTINATION) text disappears right above the directory box?<br />
<br />
This is using v2.0b1.<br />
<br />
DirText /LANG=${LANG_JAPANESE} &quot;text&quot; &quot;subtext&quot; &quot;button&quot;<br />
<br />
subtext doesn't seem to show up anywhere in the dialog box, but the button text is properly set.</div></div><hr />

Can you attach script, please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Version 2.0 beta 1 is really old. A lot has changed, I recommend you to download the latest development snapshot at http://nsis.sf.net<br />
<br />
The new beta 4 language system also makes it easier to customize texts. Read the Modern UI documentation for details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Upgrading is not a viable option to fix this particular problem, I'm working on code that has to remain very stable since it's in release mode, and since this is a very low priority problem, upgrading is not an option.<br />
<br />
Was this ever a bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Upgrading is highly recommanded, you are using an old unstable beta version. Lots of bugs have been fixed since beta 1.<br />
<br />
You should not use DirText to change the text, but read the Modern UI readme about text customization. The Modern UI has one single text on the folder selection page, but you can customize this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Upgrading NSIS is a detailed process that has a ripple effect that has high potential for introducing bugs into the product, I have experienced this before when upgrading to 2.01b. Therefore, upgrading is not a possibility in this situation. <br />
<br />
Text customization isn't the issue at hand, it's piece of text not showing up at all. But I will try not using DirText and see if that gets me anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The texts are set by the Modern UI. Again, you should NOT use DirText.<br />
<br />
When upgrading, the only major changes you have to make are related to the Modern UI, so that's only the interface (which is easy to check). The are quite some bugs you might not have noticed in beta 1 (also some related to the interface) so if possible, upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good, thanks.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiousity though, if you're not supposed to use DirText, why is it available? Or is it just not recommended using DirText when using MUI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use DirText for the Classic UI. The Modern UI itself sets DirText.</div></div><hr />
