<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BuilderBob</div><div class="date">17th April 2008, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I need some hints and leads on how to implement a dialog with two progress bars. One will show progress for each file, and one for all files in total.<br />
<br />
The most basic requirement is having a callback for file extraction progress, or something similar, and a callback for each file, even when using wildcards in File instruction.<br />
<br />
If we have that, anyone can draw a custom progress bar made from images or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">17th April 2008, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked this myself a long time ago, can't remember the answer I got, but don't expect this any time soon (unless you write a patch yourself)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BuilderBob</div><div class="date">21st April 2008, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then, any hints on how to write a patch for that? Do I need to check the file system and use some special api functions that reports file progress? Where should I look at the NSIS source code to learn what it does and find alternatives?<br />
I already have the double progress bar source code from WISE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">21st April 2008, 09:05</div></div><div class="posttext">you would probaby have to figure out the code path of the File instruction, then at some point, add a call to a callback function (like .OnInit etc. that you would also have to add code for) But you are better off talking to kichik about this, either here on the forum or the IRC channel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">21st April 2008, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The best hint I can give you is to follow the existing solution. There is code in place that prints out percentage of current file extraction. Simply modify it to update the progress bar instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BuilderBob</div><div class="date">23rd April 2008, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a great hint. I thought there's no file progress indication at all.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
