<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mattmcp</div><div class="date">13th September 2005, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought perhaps that I could modify a file in an installer created in NSIS with the Windows 'zip' command by running the following:<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 echo &quot;Referer: ...&quot; &gt; referer.txt<br />
 zip -J example1.exe              <br />
 zip -u example1.zip referer.txt  <br />
 zip -A example1.exe              <br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
For those unfamiliar with Info-Zip: #2 strips the SFX stub, #3 updates the file in the zip archive and #4 adds the SFX stub back again.<br />
<br />
And that perhaps I'd be able to compile Info-Zip to do this in Linux (ie. modify Windows SFX files in Linux).  Well, it appears I can't even do this with Info-Zip in Windows, so that's not going to work.  I tried all the compression options.  It's probably obvious to everyone else but me that NSIS doesn't create zip-compatible SFX files.  (Please tell me I'm wrong!)<br />
<br />
Is there an easy solution to this without running a Windows server?  <br />
<br />
I have an installer for a client application which offered for download via an Apache/Linux server.  I want my Apache/Linux server to tag installers before each download with referer info for that particular user.  That way when the user registers (via the client they just downloaded and installed), I know where they heard about the application.<br />
<br />
I've also looked at NSIS Self-Extractor but that doesn't seem to be what I want either.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance everyone.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I tried using UPX to pack the EXE. After adding the proper !packhdr line to my .nsi file:<br />
<br />
!packhdr &quot;$%TEMP%\exehead.tmp&quot; '&quot;C:\Progra~1\UPX\upx.exe&quot; &quot;$%TEMP%\exehead.tmp&quot;' <br />
<br />
MakeNSISW seems to be using UPX.  But, if I run 'upx -t example1.exe' on the binary output by MakeNSISW it says &quot;not packed by UPX&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">13th September 2005, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS creates SFX but not SFX archives. The internal data structure of the installers is not an archive and not a zip file. You can't change it using any zip application.<br />
<br />
For your specific need, you can either create the installer on Linux using WINE or using makensis for Linux; or you can simply tack that data to the installer. Its CRC check will not fail because of this.</div></div><hr />
