<br />
I have just downloaded NSIS and I am attempting to publish my application with it due to the fact that the &quot;One-Click&quot; default installer package that comes with VS2010 is not quite up to it (I have looked at WIX, but this was a bit too much for me to learn as I need a quick fix). <br />
<br />
One problem with NSIS is the ability to install componants/Prerequisites that I need for my C# application to run, i.e. Microsoft .NET 4.0 (I know how to deal with this one), and Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks 10.0.0.0. The latter I don't have a clue how to deal with by way of an automatic download with NSIS script. Can any one help me with this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your time,<br />
<br />
Nick</div></div><hr />

It can be tough to start with NSIS, but do not hang in!<br />
We cannot create whole installer for you, you need to read a lot of wiki and search this forums :)<br />
<br />
.NET framework was mentioned here several times, there are also several topic on wiki: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Category:Other_Products_Version_Detection_Functions<br />
<br />
With PowerPacks I have no experiences, but for downloading from internet you can use several plugins: InetC, NSISdl,InetLoad ot other: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Category:Plugins</div></div><hr />
