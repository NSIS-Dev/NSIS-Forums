<br />
We've been shipping our RepliGo (http://www.cerience.com) product based on 1.98, and just released an update which supports Symbian handheld users, and it's based on 2.0b3 (the main software is PC based, the viewers for our file format are based on handhelds).<br />
<br />
Thousands of paying customers and even more downloaders, and we've never had an issue with NSIS reported by them.  We value its compactness, simplicity, and transparency when development problems arise (I've stepped through a running debug exehead a few times to track down problems).<br />
<br />
Thanks to all involved, and I look forward to writing more .nsi files for future products.  MUI here I come!</div></div><hr />
