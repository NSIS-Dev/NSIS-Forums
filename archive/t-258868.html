<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sunlight112</div><div class="date">4th November 2006, 02:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I see zip2exe extracts file zip into computer. If I use it to extract into computer, how can I get out of these files? I know zip2exe just extract file, when finishing, I can not uninstall except delete on this disk which I extract.<br />
However I install programs, I must uninstall all softwares to support or these files which I installed.<br />
I wonder my folder with many file *.jar  and *.bat or something else, do not have file *.exe. <br />
How can I extract it into my computer which I can uninstall it?<br />
If I write a program to install these files on my system, I just know COPYFILE command to copy these file on destination system. I think I can not use WriteRegStr to write registry. I do no know how to install all these folders on computer except using zip2exe<br />
Please help me!!!<br />
Thank alot,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best way to get used to NSIS is by looking at the examples in NSIS' examples folder. Experiment with Modern UI/Basic.nsi, this is a good one to start.<br />
<br />
By the time you feel comfortable with the language, use Basic.nsi as a template and expand it with your specific needs.<br />
<br />
Have a look into the manual [1]. You'll find a lot of helpful information regarding copying files and directories:<br />

Have fun!<br />
