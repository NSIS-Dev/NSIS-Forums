<br />
if so, what do you think?  any opinions on it would be nice, so i can see where i should go from here.<br />
<br />
thanks for any response :),</div></div><hr />

<br />
how can i incorporate nsis into my program without using the command line makensis.exe?  perhaps you can help me with a bit of coding or something.  ideally the gui would show the nsis messages in its own debug window, rather than popping up makensis.exe.<br />
<br />
thanks A LOT for responding,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 06:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm not sure what the best way to integrate would be...<br />
You could actually make a version of makensis.exe that wasn't a console app, but a win32 gui app, that you could have send status text to a HWND, or something.. you're using VB right? not sure what integration issues there are...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">See some of my examples.. a while ago I posted a basic text editor compiled with the makensis code. Also I added a new function to my dll which my help.. the only reason I cant help is that I dont know VB.. setting a callback function for the text output anyone ?<br />
<br />
(http://www.incomplete.co.uk/nsis.htm)<br />
<br />
I think http://www.windridge.junglelink.co.uk/nsis.exe was the version with a notepad type thing with it, but it is only version 144. I think I uploaded the source code with that aswell ..<br />
<br />
and ermm Justin, why not emacs ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Borland Delphi does support callback functions (not sure if with DLL's).<br />
VB also supports callback functions - but it makes the IDE unstable, that's why I never use it.<br />
A simple Delphi project which compiles (calls the dll) and shows it in a form is possible, and that the Delphi DLL is called by VB. Only issue here is size because a simple Delphi program is 350 KB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you make the dll write the status text to a .txt file so i can read it into my gui, instead of using makensis.exe?  i also need to know how to call the dll correctly.<br />
<br />
thx,</div></div><hr />

Remember,  you need oldsch00l wintel.  You should be using edlin because it's waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay cooler than VIm. ;)</div></div><hr />
