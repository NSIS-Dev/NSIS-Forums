<br />
If a normal user (not administrator) shooses to install app for all users, it works (SetShellVarContext == All). But the uninstaller doesn't delete the files. Very strange.<br />
<br />
If I could check if it is an administrator, problem would be solved.</div></div><hr />

As for user checking, refer to wiki.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">f1nn</div><div class="date">23rd October 2006, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been having the same trobule installing for all users. The install works fine but when I uninstall I am left with the desktop Icon, every thing else uninstalls ok. What I am doing is using the Userinfo example to get an Admin user. Once it is Admin user I set the setShell VarContext to equal all. This installs OK. Have you any Idea why the Icon is being left behind when Uninstall takes place. This only happens when I use setShellVarContext. Any examples would be useful if you know what is causing this.</div></div><hr />

You could use the UserInfo plugin as described here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/IsUserAdmin), or the system plugin as described here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Check_if_the_current_user_is_an_Administrator). <br />
<br />
Another option would be to look for certain user privileges that relate to the admin account as described here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Enumerate_User_Privileges) or even enumerate all the available users as described here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/User_Management_using_API_calls#Enumerate_all_users).<br />
<br />
Finally you could just check the groups that the current user belongs to as described here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/User_Management_using_API_calls#Get_User.E2.80.99s_Group.28s.29)<br />
<br />
As for the desktop icon which is left behind, are you running the uninstaller using an admin context or a simple user? If you are uninstalling as a user try setting the write permissions for that file when you install your application so that everyone can delete it.<br />
