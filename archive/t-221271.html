<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nduboc</div><div class="date">12th July 2005, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The doc about Delete says &quot;The error flag is not set from trying to delete a file that does not exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
 But what about Delete on files which are inaccessible ?<br />
<br />
 For instance, suppose the the C:\foo directory is completely inaccessible (read, write, listing forbidden) and that you try<br />
to &quot;Delete c:\foo\bar.txt&quot;.<br />
<br />
 I think Delete should then set the error flag on this case, but it does not.<br />
<br />
 Is it by design or is it a bug ?<br />
<br />
 Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
IfFileExists acts as if the file does not exist. But I think this is also a bad NSIS behavior. Being unable to know if the file exists does not imply that the file does not exists. Only the final application may choose to consider these two cases as equivalent.<br />
<br />
Shouldn't an uninstaller fail if it is asked to remove a file it has no access to ?</div></div><hr />
