<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hawkmaster</div><div class="date">13th April 2010, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
asuming you have a large project to install which has about 2000 files and lot of subdirectories.<br />
Is it better to copy each single file with installer or is it better to make a self extracting exe from this project and copy this with installer. And after copying extract the exe with installer?<br />
What ist the best and quickest way?<br />
thanks a lot<br />
regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">13th April 2010, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you worried about creating 2,000 separate &quot;File&quot; commands to add those files to the installer?<br />
<br />
You can use wildcards so a single &quot;File&quot; command can be used to install a directory and all of its sub-directories.<br />
<br />
See the NSIS User Manual for details:<br />

(For autorun scanning on a CD/USB stick, it should definitely be faster to have one big file rather than 2000 files on the disc.)</div></div><hr />

I am not worried about adding 2000 files into the NIS file. I did this with the NIS Helper tool and this works fine.<br />
I was only interest in your expert experience which is the better way and which is quicker.<br />
My first test was with adding this 2000 files with the &quot;File&quot; command and it works.<br />
thanks again<br />
