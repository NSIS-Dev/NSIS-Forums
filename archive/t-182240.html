<br />
I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but here goes.<br />
<br />
On the NSIS Website I have found recently that clicking on links appears to do nothing, and I actually have to cut and paste the destination in my browser to get there. Is this a problem with the site, or my browser?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">IE6, For example, if I go to the archive and do a search on a specific author, the Authors name in the return list works, but the link for the article doesn't. Even if I try open in new window it doesn't work. But if I copy the string and paste it, it works. My guess is that my browser is definately the problem, but what's behind it I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">It's your browser. Try Ad-Aware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I already tried ad-aware, it report 0 objects found. I removed the Google toolbar, and that improved the &quot;clickability&quot; quite a bit. I wonder if it was caused by having the toolbar installed, then ad-aware removing its something to do with the toolbar. Anyways, it's a lot better now. Thanks!</div></div><hr />
