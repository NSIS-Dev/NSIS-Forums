<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SunToo</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 12:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
currently a lot of our setup applications are based on NSIS. Since we occasionally update NSIS to get advantage of new features we have to manage different NSIS versions. NSIS allows to install a newer version without uninstalling the previous one. But running different versions is not completely supported. E.g., only uninstallation of the last installed version is supported in the Add/Remove control panel, the registry data under HKLM\Software\NSIS are set to the latest installed version, ... But I don't care about these minor problems. <br />
<br />
My question is: I install two different NSIS versions on my system, e.g. version 2.25 into directory c:\NSIS_2_25 and version 2.30 into directory c:\NSIS_2_30. Then I just copy these directories to another computer where NSIS have never been installed. Is it possible to run both versions concurrently or does they rely on any common resources installed by the NSIS setup or created while makensis.exe is running?</div></div><hr />
