<br />
I was developing a Windows installer using NSIS. The application will be installed by administrator for any selected user in the system. Username will be entered by admin in a custom page. How can i do this using NSIS.<br />
<br />
I tried SetShellVarContext command, but using that we can install for all/current user. My requirement is, application should be installed for a specific user.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me on this.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, in Microsoft Windows this is rather impossible if the selected user is not logged on to the system. You *can* use the GetUserShellFolderFromRegistry function, but this is a very ugly workaround and I can guarantee you that it will not always work. It most certainly won't work on a fresh installation of Windows, for instance.<br />
<br />
What you want is not possible in Windows, because Windows is not designed to be used in this way. If you want to make a Windows installer, I suggest you only do what Windows was designed for. And that is: Admin-level installs install for all users, and user-level installs install for this user.</div></div><hr />
