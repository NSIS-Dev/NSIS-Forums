Let me try to explain what I'm trying to do.  I am using NSIS to install a game I wrote.  A lot of games you buy off the shelf have an initial splash screen with a large graphic from the game, and gives you the option to Install, Play, or maybe even view the Readme.  I'm trying to replicate that. I'm not sure if this is a feature that NSIS would be used for. If not does anyone have a suggestion on how it can be done?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mealzonwheelz</div><div class="date">31st July 2008, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that looks good.  But I don't think I can add hot spots where I can say do an event based on mouse position, like  OnMouseOverInstall, OnMouseOverUnInstall, OnMouseOverPlay, etc. <br />
<br />
Is there a plug in for this behavior? Maybe I'll extend the splash plugin for these features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you better create a custom page?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">is99</div><div class="date">4th August 2008, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">But how the custom page can be made in a size of an image and without any borders, next close buttons etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">4th August 2008, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thought I had was to manipulate the modern.exe with ResourceHacker (http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/).<br />
<br />
Or maybe you could use a web page and manipulate the browser window to do what you want--such as removing the status bar, headers, address bar, etc. (I've done this a long time ago with VBScripts, but can't recall what methods I used.  You might also have a look at the IEFunctions (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Category:Plugins) plug-in to see if that might work.)</div></div><hr />
