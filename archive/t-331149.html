<br />
I am not sure if this question can be covered in this forum. So, in case it does not, I would greatly appreciate if you could point me towards the right one.<br />
<br />
I created an installer that executes a couple of INF files and install a kernel driver; the installer works fine. <br />
<br />
Most customers insert their pci card and boot up their computers for the first time; this initializes the Hardware Found Wizard, which confuses them. <br />
<br />
The customer usually use the wizard to point to our installation cd, which does not find any INF file with the ID and fails; when the wizard fails they think that there was an error with the driver installer, and never try the full installer. (of course they call us)<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if the installer can be called from the Hardware Found Wizard. maybe through calling an INF file? Any other suggestions are welcomed.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

The solution is simple, though: Don't use the File command to compile the files into the installer exe, but use the CopyFiles command to copy plain, normal files from the CD. You can use the $EXEDIR variable to point to the CD. This way the files are available for the hardware wizard to find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The drivers that I am installing have 2 PNP INF files and a non-PNP component, is it possible to install all these 3 components from the Hardware Found Wizard? <br />
<br />
So far I have been only able to install one of the INF files</div></div><hr />

You're probably better off asking someplace else. Maybe MSDN forums?</div></div><hr />
