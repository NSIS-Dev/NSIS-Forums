<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdolan</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
<br />
This probably a really dumb question, but I can't seem to find the answer...<br />
<br />
How do I hide/minimise a shelled ExecWait window?<br />
<br />
Basically, I need to spawn out a few commands and I *have* to wait for them to complete. I've tried using ExecShell which hides nicely but doesn't wait. ExecWait waits, but does not hide.<br />
<br />
Someone please put me out of my misery.;) <br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Mike</div></div><hr />

<br />
read your documentation<br />
, and search the forum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdolan</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately HideWindow hides the INSTALLER, not the shelled command window.<br />
<br />
I have read the documentation, and I have searched the forums, google, and google groups but not seen the answer to this question...<br />
<br />
That's why I think it has to be something astoundingly obvious that I am missing, or it's a feature that no-one else wants. (Although I would have thought it would be very handy!)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">use SendMessage<br />
<br />
with this u can send messages to a window like hide or so ...<br />
<br />
its not well documented in the doku but its dokumented in the net <br />
<br />
i dont know exactly the syntax maybe justin has an example somewhere ?<br />
<br />
maybe bballer was a little bit tooo quick for having such an answer ????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdolan</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi crish,<br />
<br />
I would use SendMessage, but ExecWait pauses the script :) <br />
<br />
So I have the choice of a paused non-controllable window with ExecWait or an unpaused controllable window with Exec/ExecShell<br />
<br />
Back to the drawing board methinks ;)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">superrock</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
What about making a temporary shortcut, which is minimized and start it by ExecWait?<br />
<br />
-&gt;CreateShortCut &quot;test.lnk&quot; &quot;test.exe&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; 0 SW_SHOWMINIMIZED<br />
-&gt;ExecWait test.lnk <br />
<br />
Greeting,<br />
Andreas ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">then the only real solution is to ask justin <br />
<br />
maybe he would add the ExecShell attributes<br />
also to execwait ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zwuba</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there!<br />
<br />
I also got the same trouble as mdolan :cry: <br />
<br />
Here a short description of my disaster:<br />
I got some batch files which create my registry and right after that is finished I have to extract a few things of that registry so I have to wait until the batch file has finished otherwise nothing will be extracted :eek: <br />
<br />
I just want to ask if there is any REAL solution for that issue ...<br />
<br />
greeetz zwu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's a batch file it's not the same problem. Your problem can be easily solved using the nsExec plug-in available in NSIS 2. Read its readme in Contrib\nsExec for more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zwuba</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for your fast solution and it works as you said before!!<br />
<br />
The only thing I didn't understand is the difference between my problem and dolan's ... because he also has to call commands like I do no matter if its regedit, psexec  or a user written batch file ... isn't it?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">He never said it's a batch file. For all I know it could be Photoshop running on a script showing tons of Windows (nsExec won't hide that). As you can see he never answered rainwater, and personally, I can't be sure what he did mean by using the word command in his posts. Anyway, it doesn't matter, he probably doesn't care anymore. As you can see, he never came back for the solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdolan</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Apologies for the lack of followup - at the time of writing there was no real solution using NSIS. I moved to using an alternative tool for the job and left it at that. (Thus the comment of &quot;back to the drawing board&quot;).<br />
<br />
Still, looks like NSIS has been seriously updated since then - I now need to remember the original problem :D <br />
<br />
Thanks for those who replied.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Mike</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The solution was there already. Had you answered to rainwater you would have gotten it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdolan</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have answered but for some reason the mail notification didn't arrive... or for any subsequent messages in this thread. I was very surprised when I got a mail message today saying someone had replied!<br />
<br />
Still, my own fault for not checking back and consequently not replying to rainwater - no excuse!<br />
<br />
Apologies to all.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Mike</div></div><hr />
