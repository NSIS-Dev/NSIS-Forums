I'm just a new NSIS user and maybe my questions will be repetitive...<br />
1)I would like to know if exist a way to decompile a NSIS EXE FILE.<br />
I mean, can i get back to the .NSI script (I'VE LOST IT!!!) from the NSIS EXE FILE?!?<br />
<br />
2)I've created an .EXE self-extracting file from the ZIP2EXE utility. How can I integrate a .NSI script file for executing the ZIP2EXE file during installing process?!?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance! Have a nice day!</div></div><hr />

If you didn't recompile NSIS and you know exactly which version you have used you might be able to do it. It won't be easy though.<br />

<br />
You can't. You will have to create your own full .nsi if you want some more options than what ZIP2EXE gives you.</div></div><hr />
