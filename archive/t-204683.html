<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 06:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to create an installation   that has the option of installing in silent mode if the user specifies a paramater on the command line.  (the paramter is: /L=[path and file name here])<br />
<br />
If I detect the parameter, then I set the install to go into into silent mode using a &quot;SetSilent silent&quot; command in .OnInit.<br />
<br />
This works great, exept that the code in my sections never runs.<br />
<br />
As a test, I place the command &quot;SilentInstall silent&quot; before my sections and found using this, the install was silent AND the code executed perfectly from each section.  (Unfortunatley, this also means that my install is ALWAYs silent, which is not exactly what I wanted.)<br />
<br />
What might I be missing in the original function inside .onInit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you using the latest version of NSIS?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">13th January 2005, 01:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some more digging and found that I had a few uninstall sections that I had initially created, but then decided not to use them.<br />
<br />
Once I removed them, Silent mode started working as it should.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps sometime when I get a have more time, I'll try to find out why I was having the problems.<br />
<br />
(Things that make you go &quot;hmmm...&quot;)</div></div><hr />
