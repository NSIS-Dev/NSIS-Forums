<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">19th June 2012, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if this is even possible. But there's probably another solution to what you want to accomplish. Why do you want the file path of the included script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryo-oh-ki</div><div class="date">19th June 2012, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Because of other files placed near and used by this script. I want something like &quot;library&quot; script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">20th June 2012, 06:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I just looked at compiletime commands and found this: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter5.html#5.2.1<br />
<br />
I tried it, and they work per-file as they should, so you should use &quot;${__FILEDIR__}\${__FILE__}&quot;. However, my compiler states that filedir isn't a known constant... Perhaps it's an NSIS 3 constant?</div></div><hr />

Some future commands made their way into the online manual, probably because it's linked against the SVN repo I guess.<br />
<br />
For now, I guess you'll have to pass the directory as a command line parameter to the compiler (/d parameter)?</div></div><hr />
