<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lroathe</div><div class="date">29th February 2004, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a user with Windows XP who is unable to install one of our products which uses NSIS (The product is Bugdom 2). When he runs the installer he gets the error:<br />
<br />
The procedure entry point areFileTime could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll.<br />
<br />
I've searched this forum and FAQ and SF forums for any mention of this error and come up empty.<br />
<br />
Anyone got a clue on what the cause could be?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">29th February 2004, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say the installer is corrupted. He should download it again.<br />
<br />
He was unlucky that the corruption seems to have occured in such a way that Windows could not load it properly. Otherwise the installer's built-in CRC check would have given a sensible message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lroathe</div><div class="date">29th February 2004, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">This is happening with dozens of customers on all of our titles that use NSIS.<br />
<br />
So, if it's because of bad downloads, then NSIS needs some work on the integrity check routines.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking thru the sources, it would appear that this should be &quot;CompareFileTime&quot;, as that is the only occurance of &quot;pareFileTime&quot; I could find.<br />
<br />
Still looking at ideas; a 90% failure rate on downloads is very discouraging.<br />
<br />
Bugdom 2 and Otto Matic are the programs on our site currently using NSIS. Full versions are in the FTP directory with the demos.</div></div><hr />

NSIS contains a full data check, however, if the installer is corrupted in such a way that Windows can't load it anymore, there is nothing that can be displayed.</div></div><hr />

My script is attached, although I am not sure how it will help.<br />
<br />
I see what you mean about the data check; it does seem that the symbol table is being corrupted and preventing the installer from launching.<br />
<br />
Would have thought by now that MS would get their act together on file downloads with IE... sigh.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
