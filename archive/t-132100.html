<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thoste</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I am offering the user 3 different sections.<br />
I want to force the user to select only ONE of these sections.<br />
Whenever he checks the tiny box before a desired section<br />
all possible checks before the other sections should vanish<br />
(read. They should be disabled/disappear)<br />
<br />
How can I implement such a &quot;Radio button&quot; behaviour ?<br />
<br />
As far as I know I can use !insertmacro to unselect a certain<br />
section from the .onInit function.<br />
But is this also possible from sections for OTHER sections ?<br />
<br />
Moreover how do  I detect if and which of the other sections are currently selected ?<br />
<br />
Thx<br />
Thomas</div></div><hr />

I have NSIS installed and I looked in the examples directory and found no such file.  If you have it, could you please attach it?  Or perhaps if its somewhere online, could you please post the URL?  Thankx.</div></div><hr />
