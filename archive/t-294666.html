<br />
my first post  :)<br />
<br />
I want to know whether there is a possibility to set the user rights for an entry in the registry.<br />
<br />
Background info:<br />
 <br />
I made an entry with WriteRegStr. <br />
When a user with Main-User rights logs in to WIN XP he has only rights to read the entry but not full access.<br />
When I log in as admin I have all rights.<br />
<br />
The software has to read the entry later but can do this only when the rights are fully setted. I do not know why this is like that because usually the right to read should be suffice.<br />
<br />
I tried to use MULTIUSER_INIT macros. <br />
The installer asks for whether to install the software for all users or not but the rights are still the same in the registry..<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrisAster</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">This seems to be a problem in the way that your program (not the installer) is reading from the registry.  This is a common problem that is very easy to do accidentally.  I would check to see what permission flags are being used to read the registry values.<br />
<br />
Especially with the way that Vista handles security now, you probably should check your program out as this will be even more of a problem for you as more and more people adopt Vista.  And, to change the permissions of the registry during an installation is probably not playing nice with a user's machine, IMOHO.</div></div><hr />
