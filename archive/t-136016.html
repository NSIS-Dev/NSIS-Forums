<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlwaysLearning</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm new here. <br />
I have commercial product with approx. 550 files : DLLS , exe , <br />
system dlls , 400 graphic files : jpgs , gif , bmp and 30 mp3s.<br />
<br />
I'm building setups and trying different things for 7 hours non-stop after installing NSIS itself , the Workbench , plugins etc.<br />
It's the first time i use NSIS and i have to say : &quot;I LOVE IT !&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Our current installer is &quot;Ex-It Instyler&quot; and fully functional<br />
setup i generated with NSIS is 500KB less ( 5.8MB instead of 6.3MB ).<br />
<br />
Later than i did additional compression with 7-zip + upx and got<br />
5.5MB setup (but there's a price of double extracting + potential<br />
bugs).<br />
<br />
Now , i have quetions :<br />
<br />
1) I don't use any of start and finish windows , only the install<br />
window itslelf. How can i get rid of buttons &quot;Show Details&quot; , <br />
&quot;Close&quot; , &quot;Cancel&quot; , &quot;List control&quot; and disable close button (&quot;x&quot;) ?<br />
<br />
2) Can progress control show percents ?<br />
<br />
3) Am i allowed to remove &quot;Nullsoft Install System&quot; text ?<br />
   Are there any limitations for commercial use ?<br />
<br />
4) I put mfc42 dlls into install folder , because i don't know if<br />
user has it on his computer. Is it possible to check during installation if these DLLs exist and DOWNLOAD them in case they aren't ? ( i know it's possible to upgrade and reboot , but it's not what i need )<br />
<br />
5) I tried to comment some of defines of functionality i don't use<br />
( like &quot;REBOOT&quot; ) , but didn't see any change in setup file's size.<br />
So can one save some additional space by commenting unused functionality  ?<br />
<br />
6) I read a lot about 7-zip  on forum and after that made some tests.<br />
   Built-in 7-zip could REALLY help me. <br />
   Will it be added and when approxemetly (if yes) ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Leon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">1. It is not possible to remove the buttons, except the Show Details button by setting:<br />
ShowInstDetails &quot;show&quot;<br />
<br />
If you want to remove the log window completely, use:<br />
ShowInstDetails &quot;nevershow&quot;<br />
<br />
You can only change the text on these buttons using:<br />
MiscButtonText &quot;&lt; Back&quot; &quot;Next &gt;&quot; &quot;Cancel&quot; &quot;Close&quot;<br />
InstallButtonText &quot;Install&quot;<br />
<br />
2. There is currently no % control.<br />
<br />
3. Use:<br />
BrandingText /TRIMRIGHT &quot;Hello!&quot;<br />
<br />
4. Use the NSISdl plugin, which you can find in the ${NSISDIR}\Contrib\NSISdl directory.<br />
<br />
5. In MUI System.nsh?<br />
<br />
6. 7-zip is being built into NSIS, but it will and is taking some time ofcourse :)<br />

<br />
5. No , in config.h</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlwaysLearning</div><div class="date">21st May 2003, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">2 additional questions :<br />
<br />
1) I changed branding text to &quot;Installing Software&quot;<br />
Now , when i unisinstall my program , it still has the same <br />
branding text &quot;Installing Software&quot; which doesn't make sense :)<br />
Is there any way to change  branding text separately in install and<br />
uninstall dialogs ?<br />
<br />
2) Same question regarding &quot;AutoCloseWindow true&quot; - works fine in<br />
install window , but doesn't work in uninstall..<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
Leon</div></div><hr />

You can only set it for both the installer and the uninstaller. You can use something like this if you want to do it manually:<br />
<br />
Function un.onGUIInit<br />
# read MUI's readme if you are using it if having .onGUIInit problems<br />
  GetDlgItem $0 $0 1028<br />
  SendMessage $0 ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 &quot;STR:my text&quot;<br />
<br />
To set auto closing on runtime use SetAutoClose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">21st May 2003, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">You can remove unwanted buttons by editing the UI and telling the MUI to use it by defining MUI_UI.</div></div><hr />
