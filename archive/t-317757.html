<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zilatica</div><div class="date">16th March 2010, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to figure out how to do RAM checks and hard disk checks followed by displaying a dialog detailing the failure to meet minimum requirements if they are not met.  First off, so far I've only found one way to check RAM which is <br />
System::Alloc 32<br />
Pop $1<br />
System::Call &quot;Kernel32::GlobalMemoryStatus(i) v (r1)&quot;<br />
System::Call &quot;*$1(&amp;i4 .r2, &amp;i4 .r3, &amp;i4 .r4, &amp;i4 .r5, \<br />
                  &amp;i4 .r6, &amp;i4.r7, &amp;i4 .r8, &amp;i4 .r9)&quot;<br />
System::Free $1<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Structure size (useless): $2 Bytes&quot;<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Memory load: $3%&quot;<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Total physical memory: $4 Bytes&quot;<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Free physical memory: $5 Bytes&quot;<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Total page file: $6 Bytes&quot;<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Free page file: $7 Bytes&quot;<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Total virtual: $8 Bytes&quot;<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Free virtual: $9 Bytes&quot;<br />
<br />
Does NSIS really not have a cleaner way to check this?  I've also seen the CPUDesc plug-in at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/CPUDesc_plug-in  but am a bit cautious of consuming plugins not in the core product.  <br />
<br />
The free disk space checking at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FreeDiskSpace is fine for disk space.<br />
<br />
My REAL question is, what is the best way to display a failure to meet minimum requirements?  I don't see such a dialog in http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Modern%20UI%202/Readme.html.  I need one that is translated and all that jazz.  Anyone know of an existing min req check failed dialog?<br />
<br />
Also, sorry if this has already been asked.  Searching the forums for minimum requirements always seems to get me to Winamp minimum requirements or shoutcast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">16th March 2010, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a plugin called HwInfo (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/HwInfo_plug-in) which is described asexcellent for running a hardware check before installing files and comparing the results against the requirements for running you're program. If the results are below you're spec you can display a warning message or take other appropriate action..A forum search for &quot;HwInfo&quot; found the original thread about this plugin: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=139639<br />
<br />
There are some screenshots in that thread - the screenshot called 'hardwarecheck.jpg' seems to be the sort of thing you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Most of the plugins listed in the wiki come with source code so you can, at least in theory, check the plugin code before using it.</div></div><hr />
