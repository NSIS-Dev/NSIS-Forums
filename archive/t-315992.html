<br />
In my script, I make two calls to SetOutPath because I need to write files to both $WINDIR\SysWOW64 and $SYSDIR. But when I call SysOutPath the second time, to write to $SYSDIR, the File command still writes to the SysWOW64 directory instead:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $WINDIR\SysWOW64<br />
File Foo.DLL<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $SYSDIR<br />
File Bar.DLL ; gets written to SysWOW64 instead<br />
<br />
I am checking the output of NSIS, and the correct OUTDIR:<br />
Output folder: C:\Windows\system32<br />
<br />
I have checked previous posts, and this seems to be perfectly possible. So it is strange that this is not working for me. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you attach a zip'd up Process Monitor trace of the install?<br />
<br />
If your not sure how to capture a ProcMon trace, here are instructions: http://forum.appointmentsbook.com/showthread.php?t=125<br />
<br />
ps is it possible to reverse the calls as a workaround? eg:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $SYSDIR<br />
File Bar.DLL ; <br />
<br />
SetOutPath $WINDIR\SysWOW64<br />
File Foo.DLL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coliveira</div><div class="date">6th January 2010, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for mentioning Process Monitor. I checked that out, but couldn't find any error or explanation to why it was writing to SysWOW64.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, I hard-coded and removed any mention of SysWOW64, but it was still writing to there. On a hunch, I googled more specifically about NSIS and SysWOW64, and as it turns out, you have call to a macro inside of the x64.nsh header. Here is some documentation copied :<br />
<br />
; DisableX64FSRedirection disables file system redirection.<br />
; EnableX64FSRedirection enables file system redirection.<br />
;<br />
;   SetOutPath $SYSDIR<br />
;   ${DisableX64FSRedirection}<br />
;   File some.dll # extracts to C:\Windows\System32<br />
;   ${EnableX64FSRedirection}<br />
;   File some.dll # extracts to C:\Windows\SysWOW64<br />
;<br />
<br />
I implemented it, and it works. This will be great to have in the documentation since there are many other ways to find out if a system is 32-bit or 64-bit, so x64.nsh may never be looked at.<br />
<br />
I'm writing the solution here to hopefully help out the next person with this problem who bothers to search the forum.</div></div><hr />
