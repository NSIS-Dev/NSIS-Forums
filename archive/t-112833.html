<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">my installer distfiles are located on a network share, which could be mounted with \\server\sharename or mounted as a drive.  in either case, all one has to do to generate an installer is double-click the binary i made that calls makensis-bz2.exe - which is located in that directory.<br />
<br />
this enables the developers to be able to generate installers with a script (or do it as needed) without having to have nsis installed on their own machines.<br />
<br />
i just tried out nsis2, and makensis.exe fails when run from a network share when it looks for plugins.  copying the plugins directory to the network share did not help, not did specifying /noconfig / etc.  any ideas?  could this be a bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dick4</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 04:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I do something very similiar using vbscript to copy files into a certain directory (again, on a network share) and making an NSIS to distribute these files.  I believe I had a problem where if my paths were not absolute in the .NSI script, I had to either make them absolute or set my working directory for the script.  I dont' remember exactly but I'll check at work tomorrow, but look at that.</div></div><hr />
