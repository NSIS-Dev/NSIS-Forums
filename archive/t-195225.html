<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1001010</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 02:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my problem..<br />
I create a dynamic OutFile name based upon the version of the core application exe (Thanks LibraryLocal).<br />
After the installer is created I need to codesign it.<br />
Since the exe name changes every time, the command line to codesign.exe needs to change every time.  <br />
<br />
My theoretical solution is to alter my script to set an environment variable (%zOutFile%) at compile time &amp; use a batch file that..<br />
* calls makensis.exe to compile the script<br />
* calls codesign.exe with the dynamic %zOutFile% environment variable<br />
<br />
unfortunately when I modified my script (Before the sections)<br />
!system &quot;set zOutFile=${OutFile}&quot; $R0<br />
it didn't work :( <br />
<br />
Help?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm thinking about this all wrong?  Is there a &quot;PostBuild&quot; section in NSIS? that would allow for actions &quot;after&quot; the OutFile is finalized?  probably not.</div></div><hr />
