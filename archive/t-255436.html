<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasa0625</div><div class="date">13th September 2006, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a wise installer script i have been using for years, but now i have decided to use NSIS as my installer of choice due to its versatility and ease of use.<br />
I was wondering if there were a tool, plugin or something along those lines that could convert a .wse (wise script file (Which is just a plain text file)) into .nsi<br />
I am hoping and praying that there is because i do not want to re-interpret 4800 lines of installer script into nsis if i dont have to.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
ok, seriously, it's nice to learn nsis, instead of having automatically the script made for you. You will discover many things you can do with nsis.<br />
<br />
[edit] I just realised that I've been using nsis for more than 5 years....</div></div><hr />

I suppose i'll do a complete rewrite.. blah. at least the script will be around 1/2 the size of the original<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
