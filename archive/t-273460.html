<br />
I am totally new to NSIS and was wondering if I could use it to create an installer file that would do the following:<br />
<br />
1) Take in a bunch of information from the user and edit values in .properties, .txt and .sql files to reflect this information.<br />
<br />
2) Execute the edited .sql file to create a MySql database.<br />
<br />
3) Execute an ANT command to build the code. <br />
<br />
If anyone knows if NSIS can be used to complete the above tasks please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">27th June 2007, 00:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes to all...<br />
Basically using plugins, like this (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/MSSQL_OLEDB_plug-in).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madams</div><div class="date">27th June 2007, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply Joel. I think I have located most of the plugins that I will need to do the job:<br />
<br />
1) Edit text file with user info: TextReplace plugin (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/TextReplace_plugin) <br />
2) Execute SQL file: MSSQL OLEDB plug-in (thanks to Joel)<br />
3) Execute ANT command (via command prompt) to build the code: ExecCmd plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ExecCmd_plug-in) <br />
<br />
If someone could tell me if these are the correct plugins for the job, I would really appreciate it. Also, I couldn't find any plug-ins to manipulate .properties or .txt files. Does anybody know where I could find such plug-ins?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">27th June 2007, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">i guess the plugins are correct.<br />
<br />
though, depending on how the target system is prepared, you may not need any plugins at all.<br />
<br />
for (text)file editing have a look at the &quot;Useful Headers&quot; section in the NSIS documentation. this should fit the .properties and .txt files as well as the one mentioned in #1.<br />
<br />
for #2: if you just want to execute an sql file, doesn't ExecWait sql.exe file.sql<br />
do the trick?<br />
<br />
for #3: the build-in command ExecWait may be enough, else you may want to have a look at the nsExec plugin.</div></div><hr />
