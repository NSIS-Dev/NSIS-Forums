<br />
File: failed mmapping file &quot;file.fff&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this because Win9x can't handle larger files?<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get round this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hando</div><div class="date">23rd December 2001, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">From Documentation:<br />
Installers can be as large as 2GB (theoretically -- when building on Win9x the limit seems to be around 500MB, however building on NT then installing on Win9x works with larger sizes)<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly we have Garfield comics to thank for this discovery. That crazy cat...<br />
<br />
If your distributing on CD you could just store your files on CD and use NSIS to copy them over to the destination folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure but under WIN9X isn't the size of virtual memory fixed, in which case the limit is controlled by the configuration.<br />

I just posted the thread to see if anyone knew how to get round it. I can't find anyone who can so no need to reply any more. Thanks anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your question: you will not be able to build your installer using your current operating system (assuming Win95/98/Me).<br />
<br />
You will need to try using an NT-based OS such as WinNT/2000/XP.<br />
<br />
If you plan to store this installer on a CD, and you do not have access to an NT operating system, you should store your files on the CD and use the CopyFiles command instead of packing them in the installer.<br />
<br />

<br />
The NSIS size limit for installers built on win9x was first discovered when some guy was having problems with a present for his brother. Basically he wanted to compress a bucketload of Garfield comics into an installer and NSIS crapped itself due to the size. Dude posted on the forum, problem was discovered, additional info was added to makensis.htm. Everyone lived happily ever after.</div></div><hr />

Virtual memory size in win 9x isn't fixed by default.  I'd try it out on my Win95 box, but it'd take for ever as it's only a P66 :)</div></div><hr />

It was only recently that I had a feature request (which, btw, was solved with 1.90 .onNextPage &amp; InstallOptions DLL) so decided to register.</div></div><hr />

That would take forever to compile an NSIS Installer at 2 GB :) :igor: <br />
