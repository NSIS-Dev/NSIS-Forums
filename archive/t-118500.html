<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ivank</div><div class="date">20th December 2002, 02:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I find myself duplicating a lot of functions, since they are used in both installer and uninstaller. As you know, uninstaller can call only functions with &quot;un.&quot; prefix, and they in turn can call only &quot;un.&quot; functions. <br />
<br />
Given the fact that the optimizer will throw away unused functions anyway, this limitations looks superfluous and leads to code duplication -&gt; problems with maintenance.<br />
<br />
BTW, how can one become a member of NSIS team and get access to SourceForge source tree? If intensity of my load at work will permit, I probably could to try to implement this change myself (I am quite experienced C++ programmer).<br />

If you do want to duplicate just make a macro out of it and insert that macro in two functions, install and uninstall. If you need to call functions from within that macro use ${UN?} define:<br />
<br />
!macro aFunction UN?<br />
Call ${UN?}.otherFunction<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
If you want to get into the NSIS team you will have to just do stuff and if we see that you do a lot of good stuff you will get in (as vague as possible :D)... There are no rules or something like that.</div></div><hr />
