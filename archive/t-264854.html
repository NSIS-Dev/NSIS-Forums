<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">original1</div><div class="date">1st February 2007, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an installer that silently installs an application which creates a number of sub folders when it runs, these can be any number depending on thee assets it downloads remotely to the client machine.<br />
<br />
I am trying to find a way to delete the sub directories and their contents in the uninstall section of the installer.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am going blind but I can't find a way to do this the uninstaller deletes the top level but leaves the sub-directories, I want it to clean up completely <br />
<br />
any pointers please?</div></div><hr />

risky when depended on user selection, none couldn't tell if some user has selected on select directory page something like e.g. Program Files without the appended application name, in this case the entire Program Files is going to be removed.</div></div><hr />
