<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember reading yesterday that there was some way to do custom vs. express installs, but for the life of me can't find the post or documentation related to that today.<br />
<br />
If I can't do that I simply need to know if I can make certain sections silent and then I can use an installoptions page and<br />
sectionsetflags ${section} 0 (I think).<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Silent installation could be performed as follows,<br />
1. Globally with SilentInstall<br />
2. With /S parameter from command line<br />
3. Dynamically in function .onInit with SetSilent<br />
The later is useful e.g. when you want to check certain conditions on target in order to determine which installation mode should be performed.<br />
<br />
Checking with IfSilent instruction, means that you're able to execute or skip parts of your script accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">3rd May 2007, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the command I was looking for, Insttype.  In my .onInit function I use setsectionflags to determine which sections are set by default.  <br />
<br />
What I want to do is create an express install that only installs the sections I've determined to be selected and a custom install showing the sections I've deemed selected. <br />
<br />
Is this possible with Insttype?  If I could just get it to select the correct boxes without selecting nothing then this would be a perfect solution. <br />
<br />
If I can't use this I'm afraid I'm going to have to use a non-elegant workaround with installoptions and setting sections to be silent or even skipped or whatever, which I don't know how to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">3rd May 2007, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to double post, but I have another question about InstType.  It says you can have as many as 32 options, but what is the point if the options are either to show or not show the selection list?  I hope that I am wrong and there is a list somewhere about the different options you have with InstType.<br />
