<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">31st July 2007, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I had in my script support for multiple languages. Later on, my company decided that for now we support english only. Because I know for a fact that this will get change to support multi-language again, I left the language-code into the script, and I just commented out the following lines:<br />
<br />
<br />
;!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;French&quot;<br />
...<br />
Function .onInit<br />
;!insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />
...<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything seems to work fine, english is by default used in the installer and uninstaller, no language dialog is shown. But there is one problem: if I install silently (my-setup.exe /S) the &quot;NSIS:Language&quot; entry is NOT written in the registry, which means that when I later uninstall the program from Add/Remove programs, I get the choose-language-dialog, which is not desired. (The &quot;NSIS:Language&quot; is written into the registry if the installer is run non-silent)<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
a) Why in a silent install the NSIS:Language is not written into the registry? Is this by design? I mean, in a non-silent install, even if the language-dialog is not shown, the NSIS:Language is written into the registry with the default value.<br />
b) How could I solve my problem without removing my language code from the script?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
Thx for your answer.<br />
<br />
a) Are you saying that the language is not saved because the &quot;InstFiles page leave function&quot; is not called in a silent install?<br />
<br />
b) I could put the !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_SAVELANGUAGE into the Main section at the end of it, in case of IfSilent, no?<br />
<br />
c) btw, is this problem a bug of MUI, or I'm just using it inadequately?<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">31st July 2007, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a common mistake to think that a page leave function is executed in a silent install. Of course, it isn't, because the page itself is never displayed.<br />
Using IfSilent or ${If} ${Silent} with that in a hidden/unselectable section is the way to go.<br />

Yes, this is clear. What it's not clear, is: shouldn't this somehow be already supported in MUI? I mean MUI_LANGDLL_SAVELANGUAGE is not even documented, so it shouldn't be the user's job to call it specially in a silent install. So, it's either a MUI bug, or I'm misusing something.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I agree, but on the other hand no language is selected also when the !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY is commented out, like in my case, and still in that case a language is saved in a non-silent mode.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes but my point is if you installed silently originally, you would have never selected a language so the uninstaller has to display the dialog.<br />
