<br />
I just voted in the poll and said it was hard, I just want to make sure that at least my entry is not misinterpreted. I don't think there are too many features to learn (in fact I think quite a few could be added) but that for what is there it is way too cryptic.<br />
<br />
Needs at least named parameters and a common if command with expression evaluation not heaps of jump commands...<br />
<br />
My 2 cents worth.<br />
