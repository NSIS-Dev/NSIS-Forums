Note that you need to compile it from sources. The documentation also needs to be compiled. Use Docs\src\build.bat to build it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sfranklin</div><div class="date">15th October 2004, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">ok thanks for that. I cant use that in our current installer, as its due to be shipped very shortly, so unless you can think of a way to do that as a stopgap, i will wait until the next minor release (any idea when that is due?)<br />
<br />
thanks again for your reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th October 2004, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no way to do this in the current release, unless you want to change the source code. Next release is due next weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sfranklin</div><div class="date">15th October 2004, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">next weekend will be fine. I can be that patient :) <br />
<br />
thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th October 2004, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I should warn you that release dates have a tendency to get postponed a lot. A few months have usually passed between releases of NSIS. Each day that passed brought more changes that delayed it even more. We are trying to make shorter release cycles now, which is why 2.02 is due next weekend, only a month after 2.01 was released. I really hope it'll be released next weekend, but I can't promise.</div></div><hr />
