<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John_Sum</div><div class="date">14th November 2007, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">This may be a naive question as I do not have a great deal of experience with NSIS.<br />
<br />
I am trying to build an installer in Simplified Chinese. I can do this and the Chinese displays correctly in the installer dialogue, when run on Chinese Windows, except for one place which is the initial language selection combo.  If I put German in, it say Deutsch, French is shown as Francais etc. but Simplified Chinese is shown as Chinese(Simplified), i.e. in English, and it is not shown in Chinese script.<br />
<br />
I have tried compiling in English Windows and Chinese Windows all to no avail.<br />
<br />
When compiling, I get a warning which refers to:<br />
<br />
LangString &quot;DESC_SecInstall&quot; is not set in language table of language SimpChinese<br />
<br />
but I can no reference to this.<br />
<br />
I am using the modern UI and pretty much copying the multilingual example.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate anyone's help.  Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th November 2007, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">That happens because the standard of using the English name for the language selection is not enforced in the language files.<br />
<br />
The LangString warning is generated because you haven't defined a Chinese text for the DESC_SecInstall LangString.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So - are you saying that with Simplified Chinese, the standard of using English is applied.  If so, do you know how to stop that happening so I can display a Chinese string?<br />
<br />
Secondly, I have no idea where to define DESC_SecInstall.  Is this the string that is the Chinese text for Simplified Chinese?  The inclusion of German gives a similar error message, so I suspect that this is not particularly relevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th November 2007, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Those strings come from the language file. Edit Contrib\Language files\SimpChinese.nsh. You can also hack it a bit by redefining LANGFILE_SIMPCHINESE_NAME to the string you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John_Sum</div><div class="date">16th November 2007, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for the reply and for your help.<br />
<br />
I have resolved the problem now, by editing the .nsh file.  Has to be done on a Chinese Windows system though - could not get it accepted on a language-packed English system.</div></div><hr />

Check out www.scratchpaper.com for the binaries and source.  You can also look at the &quot;Unicode&quot; thread in this forum for more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John_Sum</div><div class="date">21st November 2007, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx.<br />
<br />
I'll look into that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John_Sum</div><div class="date">21st November 2007, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Great stuff.  The unicode version has completely solved my problem.<br />
<br />
Many, many thanks!</div></div><hr />
