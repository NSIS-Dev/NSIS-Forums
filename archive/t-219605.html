<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdfy</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">In my installer I have to patch several dozens of files. How to automate creating of pat files ? It's annoying write something like <br />
GENPAT oldfile.txt newfile.txt patch.pat <br />
for each file :(<br />
I have new files ( &lt;filename&gt;.* ) and old ones (&lt;filename&gt;.bak ). How to process all the files to generate &lt;filename&gt;.pat files ? <br />
Maybe some bat-file? I just don't know how to make it process all the files in the folder(s)<br />
<br />
Ideally, I want part of *nsi file generates automaticly :)<br />
something like this:  <br />
vpatch::vpatchfile &quot;$INSTDIR\&lt;source dir&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.pat&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\&lt;source dir&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.*&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\&lt;source dir&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.*&quot;<br />
where &lt;source dir&gt; is the name of folder ( without full path ) where file is situated.<br />
Any suggestions ? Did anyone solve such a problem ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way is to create another NSIS installer which loops through all the files in a folder, and runs GENPAT on each one. It also writes to a seperate .nsi script vpatch lines which you !include in your main script.<br />
The installer can be ran from the top of the main script with !execute or !system.<br />
<br />
Example of this method:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdfy</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Afrow UK<br />
I made the following<br />
<br />
Section  &quot;1&quot;<br />
;SetAutoClose true<br />
Setoverwrite on<br />
SetoutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\&quot;<br />
File &quot;genpat.exe&quot;<br />
FindFirst $3 $2 &quot;*.p3d&quot;<br />
loop3:<br />
FindNext $3 $2<br />
DetailPrint &quot;File: $2&quot;<br />
execDos::exec 'GENPAT old/$2 $2 $2.pat'<br />
IfErrors 0 loop3<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
It's worky and I have some ideas how to process all the subfolders ,but I have a question :<br />
I need to run GENPAT only on files that has the old version in old folder. How to make a condition ?<br />
And I still have a dream :) how to generate part of *.nsi ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdfy</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">In other words I have several folders of files. I need to update the same files in the destination folders and add new ones. My installer is some kind of a patch and there're will be new versions, so I want to automate the process...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdfy</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes! I did it. It's much easier then I thought :) <br />
When ther's no old file   GENPAt simply pass it through without error. Now I can easily generate vpatch info I need:) <br />
What about autogeneration ? Any ideas ? What plugin can I use ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">When you mean autogeneration, do you mean by executing the compiled exe everytime you compile the script?<br />
If so, just use !execute.<br />
<br />
Your code will only work for files in a single folder. If you have files to patch in more subfolders, you can use Recursive Find:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahoyle</div><div class="date">12th September 2006, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking at doing something very similar. However, I have a very large project, but only a few files are likely to have changed between versions. I have notice that if you run genpat on two identical files it will still generate a patch file (all be it a small one). <br />
<br />
Is there any easy way to find out if the files are identical before I call genpat. Or any way to test the results from genpat to see if the files were identical. <br />
<br />
I just don't want the patch package to try to patch loads of idenitical files, it will just waste time and space.<br />
<br />
I have tested the return value from genpat, but it returns zero in both cases. I have noticed it does show a warning message. I am going to see if a can capture the text output from getpat and search it for the warning message, but is in not very elegant. Any better ideas ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th September 2006, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried nsisPatchGen (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=246941&amp;highlight=vpatch)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahoyle</div><div class="date">15th September 2006, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Kichik<br />
<br />
Yes I have tried nsisPatchGen but I have had some difficulties (I have yet to get it to work for me). Anyway I have written a NSIS script that does most of what I want. <br />
<br />
But to check is a file does require patching I am checking for a string message in the output from genpat, which is not very robust way to program, but I don't known of a better method.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />
