<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Collector9999</div><div class="date">22nd December 2011, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to get a user's Saved Games folder on Vista or Win7? I could use &quot;$PROFILE\Saved Games\&quot;, but this does not take into account the possibility of a user that has renamed or moved this folder. The Registry uses a GUID string to store the value in addition to a string named &quot;!Do not use this registry key&quot; inside the key where the shell folders are located. I thought of the System Plugin's Get Special Folders, but it does not seem to take into account this directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however, as &quot;saved games&quot; might be localized, i wouldn't rely on &quot;$PROFILE\Saved Games&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Collector9999</div><div class="date">24th December 2011, 03:51</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said, I could use &quot;$PROFILE\Saved Games&quot;, but it is a system folder on Vista/Win7 and as such, it seems like if it is not one of the NSIS built-in variables (i.e. $STARTMENU or $DOCUMENTS) it would be a good idea to have it added to the System Plugin's Shell Folder functions, however, I am afraid that writing or modifying plugins is beyond my abilities. I am able to write some decent NSIS scripts, but I am not a programmer. <br />
<br />
The Registry string I mentioned, named &quot;!Do not use this registry key&quot; has a value of Use the SHGetFolderPath or SHGetKnownFolderPath function insteadIs there anyway to call either of these functions using the System Plugin?</div></div><hr />

There is. If you search the NSIS forum for 'shgetfolderpath', you'll find some examples really quick: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?p=2462946#4<br />
<br />
Then, a quick google for &quot;saved games csidl&quot; found this: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378457%28v=vs.85%29.aspx<br />
Next up, a google for &quot;!define FOLDERID_SavedGames&quot; to find the numerical value of the constant. And goody goody, Christmas came early: http://portableapps.com/node/11936<br />
<br />
This took exactly 3 minutes of work. Why didn't you try it yourself?</div></div><hr />
