I get that part, however I'm a little confused about how to create the Custom Screen in the Modern UI. If I wanted to get the Installer to auto select all cd-rom drives, I would have to use Enumurate CD-ROMs, Now how do I encorporate, That plus Making it search for a Certain file on the CD. that the files would be copied from. I not real sure how I would write that INI file it seems to complexed. <br />
<br />
So basicly I need help with making a coustom install screen that has a droplist to select a cd-rom drive that has a certain cd and files, and writing a INI for all of it.<br />
:igor: <br />
I hope that is clear, I've just started using this program, however I will say its a lot better than the other install programs ex. Install shield, Wise<br />
<br />
:(Sorry for the mis communication.<br />
<br />
:up: Thanks for reponding so soon.<br />
Cheers <br />

Why would you need to ask the user for it? You can pass it on the command line in read it from $CMDLINE or if the installer is in the same directory as the files, you can use $EXEDIR.</div></div><hr />
