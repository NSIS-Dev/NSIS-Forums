<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vtsaran</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
Perhaps I do not how to search, but I could not find anywhere an answer to my question (pretty strange, I admit). :)<br />
<br />
I am trying to compile an NSIS script that utilizes library.nsh header with installlib macros on a Posix system using the previously-compiled and working 2.45 version of &quot;makensis&quot;. For reasons beyond my control I do not use cross compiler, eg mingw, or any other similar tools.<br />
Prior to my using library.nsh in my installation script, I was able to successfully compile by simply skipping all the plugins, utilities etc (skipplugins, skiputils etc). However, since I started using installlib macros, my compilation fails with references to minor_version and major_version calls. I know that Appendix that describes the library says that DLL version checkes are required in order for the header to compile, but I am wondering if there is any work-around for this limitation on Posix systems (I use CentOS if that matters).<br />
Also, I can successfully compile the script on Windows, so I know it is working fine.<br />
<br />
Again, I am using NSIS 2.45.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a bit confused. You are talking both about compiling a script and compiling makensis in the same context. I'll assume MINOR|MAJOR_VESRION you're missing is when building LibraryLocal.exe that's used by Library.nsh.<br />
<br />
First off, it's no shame not to use cross compiler. It's even preferable. Build only what needs to be built native to work, and use the pre-built zip for everything else. It's always smaller, faster and better tested.<br />
<br />
Next, I don't know how exactly you got errors about missing version definition and I won't know without seeing the error itself. That said, simply pass the version information to avoid it.scons VERSION=2.46 VER_MAJOR=2 VER_MINOR=46 VER_REVISION=0 VER_BUILD=0 SKIP...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vtsaran</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Apologies for confusing you and everyone else. Indeed, I am trying to recompile the &quot;makensis&quot; file so that I can compile the .nsi script which utilizes library.nsh header.<br />
<br />
When I attempt to compile the script with my current version of &quot;makensis&quot; (version 2.45), this is what I get:<br />
<br />
sh: LibraryLocal: command not found                                             <br />
warning: unknown variable/constant &quot;{LIBRARY_VERSION_HIGH}&quot; detected, ignoring (<br />
macro:InstallLib:120)                                                           <br />
warning: unknown variable/constant &quot;{LIBRARY_VERSION_LOW}&quot; detected, ignoring (m<br />
acro:InstallLib:121)                                                            <br />
!undef: &quot;LIBRARY_VERSION_HIGH&quot; not defined!                                     <br />
Error in macro InstallLib on macroline 125                                       <br />
<br />
I tried recompiling the &quot;makensis&quot; passing version, version_major, version_minor, version_rev etc constants to the scons, but this did not help any.<br />
<br />
Am I missing the LibraryLocal component?<br />
<br />
I am a bit lost, so any pointers would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vtsaran</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Disregard my previous message. After an extensive search in the forums, I found that one has to compile the LibraryLocal using scons with a &quot;LibraryLocal&quot; target. Afterwards, copy &quot;LibraryLocal&quot; from your build/release/LibraryLocal folder into /usr/bin or wherever convenient.<br />
<br />
All seems to work now.<br />
