<br />
The nightly build is created on a linux box, so there's no easy way to do that.  You can still run !InstallNSIS.bat to create the installer once you download the zip though.  Plus, it helps us figure out which files the installer doesn't include :)</div></div><hr />

I know about !InstallNSIS.bat, but I just thought (because of size and lots of empty pointless CVS folders)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would require you compile NSIS on linux and make it able to create win32 installers.  This was done with an old version of NSIS but not with the 2.x series as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nightly builds are zipped, the installer uses BZIP2 compression.<br />
<br />
I don't think that we should use another compression method. Everyone has an unzip program, other formats are less common.</div></div><hr />
