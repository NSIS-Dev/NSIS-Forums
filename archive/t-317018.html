<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alex_sh</div><div class="date">14th February 2010, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I have an installer which can be used for &quot;global&quot;, as well as &quot;local&quot; installations. By &quot;global&quot; I mean installing to system locations, creating shortcuts, etc...<br />
While &quot;local&quot; installation is essentially just extracting into a directory (INSTDIR).<br />
<br />
The thing is, I don't know how to determine if it needs administrative privileges when doing a &quot;local&quot; installation. For example, doing an installation to &quot;C:\program files\...&quot; would require admin privileges, while installing to a user's personal directory wouldn't.<br />
<br />
Right now I just have &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot;, but it doesn't allow ordinary users to do a &quot;local&quot; install to their directories.<br />
<br />
I know there's a UAC plugin ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in ), but there's almost no documentation there and I have no idea how to use it to achieve my goal.<br />
<br />
Any help would be really appreciated.<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Function TestFileAccess<br />
      ;ACCESS_MASK = FILE_GENERIC_READ | FILE_GENERIC_WRITE | FILE_GENERIC_EXECUTE | DELETE<br />

      IntOp $1 $1 &amp; 0x0010<br />
      ${If} $1 != 0<br />
      ${AndIf} ${FileExists} &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
        ;Instdir exists and is a directory. <br />
        ; Check instdir for 0x1301BB (with DELETE)<br />
        ; We need delete privs: Instdir may have been created by another user, thus not giving us delete access.<br />
        System::Call &quot;kernel32::CreateFile(t `$INSTDIR`,i 0x1301BB,i 3,i 0,i 3,i 0x02000000,i 0)i .r1&quot;<br />

        ${Do}<br />

          IntOp $1 $1 &amp; 0x0010<br />
          ${If} $1 != 0<br />
          ${AndIf} ${FileExists} &quot;$2&quot;<br />
            ;It exists and is a directory.<br />
            ${ExitDo}<br />
          ${EndIf}<br />
          ${CutBeforeLastBackslash} $2 $2<br />
          StrLen $3 $2<br />
          ${If} $3 == 2<br />
            ${ExitDo}<br />
          ${EndIf}<br />
        ${Loop}<br />
        ; Check instdir\..\..\.. for 0x1201BB (without DELETE).<br />
        ; We don't need delete privs: The user creating a dir is always owner, so as long as we<br />
        ; create instdir at user level we'll get delete access automatically.<br />
        System::Call &quot;kernel32::CreateFile(t `$2`,i 0x1201BB,i 3,i 0,i 3,i 0x02000000,i 0)i .r1&quot;<br />
        System::Call &quot;kernel32::CloseHandle(ir1)&quot;<br />
        pop $3<br />
        pop $2<br />
      ${EndIf}<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
Function YourFunction<br />
  Call TestFileAccess<br />
  ${If} $1 == -1<br />
    ;We don't have access rights. Pop an error.<br />
  ${EndIf}<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
The point of interest is the CreateFile/CloseHandle command. It does not actually create anything, but it will return a positive handle ID if the user calling it has enough privileges. If not, it'll return -1. Oh, and I pasted those two macros I used in here: http://nsis.pastebin.com/fc93d069</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alex_sh</div><div class="date">14th February 2010, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you both for your replies.<br />
<br />
The MultiUser stuff - I think I read somewhere that it's not compatible with UAC. Also, I don't quite see the thing I'm looking for there (maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way).<br />
<br />
MSG, thanks a lot for your code.<br />
One question though - is this code known to work with WOW emulation on 64-bit windows? I know windows does a lot of behind-the-scenes path substitution in that mode, and e.g. &quot;C:\windows\system32&quot;'s parent directory may not always be &quot;C:\windows&quot;. (I wrote that as an example - it might work for these directories, but for others it might not).</div></div><hr />

Hmm... That's an interesting question. I was going to say that, because the redirection happens behind the scenes, the above code should not be affected by it. &quot;$INSTDIR\..\..&quot; could never become some strange virtualstore directory, because $INSTDIR is just a string, and that string does not contain virtualstore.<br />
But then I realized I have no idea when exactly the path gets expanded to its physical location. If &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\Test\..&quot; is expanded to $PROGRAMFILES before it's sent to win32 api, there's no problem. But if it's the api commands that expand the path... It might get tricky.<br />
<br />
Then again, although I don't know how to find out which of the two actually happens, I haven't encountered any problems with the code. But perhaps some programmer could help out to clarify?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">15th February 2010, 04:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, right, he was asking about WOW64. What about permissions-related virtualization, though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alex_sh</div><div class="date">19th February 2010, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">There seem to be a lot of cases when windows decides to rewrite the paths. I think this breaks the parent directory / subdirectory relationships based on path string parsing.<br />
<br />
There's this: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927387<br />
<br />
And there's also WOW64. For WOW64 I think the most correct way would be to get a real path from our virtualized path, and then use it in the above checks. Simply disabling the path translation is incorrect IMHO.<br />
<br />
I found the question asking about how to do this ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/942110/translating-32-bit-paths-to-their-wow64-equivalents ), but it remains unanswered.</div></div><hr />
