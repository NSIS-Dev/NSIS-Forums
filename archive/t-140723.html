<br />
We'll have to check the author oppinion about this.<br />
<br />
What do you think about including an existing free NSIS editor into NSIS. Please note that only NSIS editors can be included not generic editors with support for NSIS?</div></div><hr />

All make the job right...<br />
:) I vote for Workbench, it's only the update thing</div></div><hr />

I don't know who voted for new project but guys keep in mind that for new project we'll have results in weeks, months ?! If you want to work at a new project post a message with your skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sealite</div><div class="date">3rd July 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">i've contacted them an now i'm wainting for their response. If they don't responts i'll consider that they don't want to include their work in the installer. My personal vote is for HM NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">We have no plans to include a specific editor. First of all because most editors are not open source (everything that will be included should be open source). Also, because many editors are not finished yet, including only one of 'em is not good for the editor development.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">How about instead of including a specific editor in the project we include, in the NSIS Readme, a list of NSI specific editors, their development &amp; nsis support, e.g. NSIS version number they support, and their download location.  This way NSIS users will be able to get the best editor for their needs and it will also incourage editor development.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You can find a list of NSIS Editors in the Archive. It's better to leave it there, because the information changes quite often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Then how about adding a link to that archive page in the readme so that new users know where to find some editors?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a link on the main page of the manual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 23:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I have decided to make Venis into Shareware.  It is similar to the mIRC shareware model.  It encourages registration within 30 days but is still functional if not registered.<br />
<br />
I am planning on making an install of Venis with NSIS packaged in the install.  The package will include a readme.txt and credits.txt.  The credits.txt will list names found in the Credits html page of the NSIS Html docs.  The Html docs will remain untouched along with the location NSIS installs by default with all added packages in the current NSIS distributions.<br />
<br />
I personally do not think any one NSIS editor should be packaged into the NSIS install.  I think if anything, it should be packaged by the Editor.  If you do package an NSIS editor with NSIS, it should be a new opensource project.  It may be an advantage in keeping them seperate; you can install NSIS and then install the different editors and be confident they will not mess up the currently installed NSIS.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have a section in the documentation with all the popular NSIS editors with a brief description what their strengths are.  For instance, I made Venis into an editor rather than a wizard script generator because that is what I wanted.<br />
<br />
I will, hopefully by tomorrow, have a prerelease ready of Venis 2.1.  I will send an E-mail to the Source Forge NSIS administrators and post a link to it here.</div></div><hr />

What I understood with that options it that the editor should be a separated (new) project, not an enterly new project. If that option was the last in the list this idea would be easier to understand.<br />
<br />
But I didn't vote &quot;new project&quot; because I always read what people say before ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I am close to completeing the next release of Venis.<br />
<br />
New features include Drag and Drop Function Wizards, loading and saving of sessions, and reloading of previously opened documents.<br />
<br />
I am also collecting notes what features should be included in a new install wizard.  Please visit the install wizard thread on the Venis forum and contribute ideas.  http://www.spaceblue.com/venis/suggestions.php?Section=8<br />
<br />
Download the latest version of Venis IX here: http://www.venisix.com<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 01:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Including a editor with the NSIS will make the package more bigger, and everytime that the application is updated, have to update the whole package... And the person downloading NSIS will be &quot;obligated&quot; to install it in his/her machine, liking or disliking the program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">12th October 2003, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Deguix:<br />
<br />
I have the opposite opinion with the same result.  I ponder including the latest NSIS with the Venis install, but I know some would prefer to run a particular previous version of NSIS cause they have written scripts in the past with that version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th October 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">If there will be a NSIS editor which is completely finished and features a really good wizard, editor, dialog designer etc., it would be possible that we make one available for download at the project page or add a download option to the installer.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's a good idea to include NSIS with any editor. Many people want to use development snapshot or other versions. People should also not get the idea that they can't change the compiler.</div></div><hr />
