<br />
I would like to find out if a specific DLL is in use by a running process, in order to prompt the user to close it.<br />
Is there a plugin or a macro in NSIS that does it?<br />
<br />
I looked in the wiki but no success...<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
<br />

<br />
1) close the process using the DLL?<br />
Then one could use an NSIS plugin. e.g.<br />
KillProcDLL::KillProc &quot;myapp.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
2) or do you want to close the in use in memory DLL?<br />
This is not advised, but somehow doalble, don't know from top of my head, but google is your friend.</div></div><hr />

I hate these things!! What I want to do is to prompt the user to close the application, and retry. So I have to check if the DLL is loaded, and find which process has loaded it.<br />
If I have time I would write a plugin, using the function EnumProcessModules of the Win32 API, it does the job...<br />
