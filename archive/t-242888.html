<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JATO</div><div class="date">7th April 2006, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">IT Helpdesk.. trying to automate a Batch file fix... want to use NSIS to copy the Batch file to a workstation and then have it execute as THAT user not as the helpdesk person who copied it over.<br />
<br />
I know how to copy it over using a UNC path<br />
I know how to use EXEC -- but won't EXEC  execute as the person who copied the file.. not the machine it was copied to?<br />
<br />
I could have the person on the phone click on the batch file...but thought it would be cooler if it just RAN on it's own.<br />
<br />
Please advise.. I've seen references to Exec and ShellExec but nothing that addresses my issue directly.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, you can write to the user's registry by manually loading the hive. That way, you can have your application execute when the user logs in. Put it in the RunOnce registry key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JATO</div><div class="date">7th April 2006, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks.. yeah, thought about doing that..but since we're a helpdesk.. we want to save time and NOT have people reboot if we can help it. <br />
I'll just have the employee double click on the Batch file manually after it's copied over.<br />
<br />
if anyone else has a better work around besides RunOnce or starting a service... please let me know</div></div><hr />
