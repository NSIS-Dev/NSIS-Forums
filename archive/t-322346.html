<br />
I want to make an installer that is very large, 800+ MB, but it won't let me.<br />
<br />
Error is<br />
<br />
Internal compiler error #12345: error mmapping file (1295312877, 33554432) is out of range.<br />
<br />
Note: you may have one or two (large) stale temporary file(s)<br />
left in your temporary directory (Generally this only happens on Windows 9x).<br />
<br />
<br />
I have read this thread http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=122373 but I do not understand the part about changing the directory. The guy (Mark_lve) had solved it<br />
<br />
<br />
Was just about to reply i worked around the problem by changing my environment variable tmp and temp paths to my bigger drives as you said this works fine now<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />
but I don't know how he changed his paths...<br />
<br />
Help please.</div></div><hr />

Both of my drives of NTFS (C and D) and I have Windows 7 x64<br />
<br />
Edit: By the way, if you're going to suggest compressing it into zip file, it won't work cause it's too big for zip lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">punkomat</div><div class="date">14th September 2010, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure you have enough memory ? makensis will map the output file to memory, but it needs to HAVE that memory in order to succeed. If you don't have RAM, virtual memory is good enough, increase you paging file to 4GB, and make sure your system harddrive has the required space for it to grow to that limit.<br />
<br />
There's also a 2GB installer limit imposed by the 32 bit PE executable format, and I think you will see a similar message there - but you are not yet hitting that limit from what you say. To go beyond 2GB you need a tool that appends the file data as junk after the PE structure, something like SFX WinRar.</div></div><hr />
