<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizard76</div><div class="date">6th October 2008, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
Is there a way to completely hide the details of the installation from the user? For instance I have an installer that uses MUI2 and I have set ShowInstDetails to never however on the install page the user can still see the current file being extracted and/or executed. It would be preferable if I can mask/hide this from the user since I don't want them to be aware of which files are being dealt with at any time during the installation process.<br />
<br />
I have attached an image of the line of text on the install page that I am hoping to have hidden.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your assistance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway.. ShowInstDetails only governs the (optional) scrolling list, not the label you're referring to.  You can always hide that label, if you want; check out the following thread which deals with a similar issue (it hides the progress bar)<br />

I guess this has sparked a new question. If I can get a handle on the label, is there a way to change the text so give the user some kind of indication of what's happening? It would be good for us to change the label to something like &quot;Now installing, please wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your help is very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Several example scripts are shipped with NSIS. The makensis.nsi script (in the &quot;Examples&quot; folder) shows how to do this. Here is a fragment from that file:<br />
SetDetailsPrint textonly<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Installing NSIS Core Files...&quot;<br />
SetDetailsPrint listonlyThe NSIS installer creates a Start Menu shortcut to the &quot;Examples&quot; folder</div></div><hr />
