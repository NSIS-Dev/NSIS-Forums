<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ctlajoie</div><div class="date">15th July 2003, 04:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a search through the forum and found that most of the icon issues were solved for the ModernUI, so I'd like to first mention that I am NOT using the modern UI.<br />
<br />
I have an icon that I'd like to use for the installer that is about 16k bigger than the one for the uninstaller.  I've included both of them (and my script) in the zip.  Is it possible to &quot;zero-fill&quot; the smaller one to equal the size of the larger one to solve this problem?  If not, is there another solution?<br />
<br />
I'm very curious as to why it needs them to be the same size.  What's the purpose behind that?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th July 2003, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no way to zero fill one of the icons, unless you want empty icons to show up for the EXE. The reason for this limitation is to ease the process of changing the icon for the uninstaller. Including a full fledged resource editor to make the installer capable of changing the icon to another icon with a different structure is a waste of space. So is including the uninstaller header in the data block of the installer.</div></div><hr />
