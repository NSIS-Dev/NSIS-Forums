<br />
I am wondering if there is a way how to detect if a certain application is running and by what user in a multi-user system.<br />
<br />
I found a lot of discussions how to detect a running application with an executable name but moreover I would like to know what user is running the application. If more than one user got the application running how to get the list of the users.<br />
<br />
I need this information in order to uninstall.<br />
I just donâ€™t want to uninstall in one user account if the application is still running in another user account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
M.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not familiar with the .NET Process class but it sounds to me that the user needs to have the .NET framework installed. Is that correct?<br />
Can you explain it a little more bit in detail how i could apply that process class for my purpose or direct me to a link which gives more information.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
M.</div></div><hr />

That sample is written in Delphi.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately I am not a member of the expert-exchange website and therefore can not see the solution.<br />
<br />
Could you attach the solution in this thread please?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
