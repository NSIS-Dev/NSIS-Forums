<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">i've been thinking about building my own ui for a while now, but there are a couple of things i still don't get.<br />
<br />
1. (not exactly nsis relatated) what units are used for width and height of a control in the resource file? i'm not at my home computer now, but i remember resizing a bitmap to 74x74 and that turned out to be 300x300 pixels - though i'm not sure if it even turned out to be a square!<br />
<br />
2. how can i add a place holder for an image and manipulate it in my script? i was hoping that MUI (header image!) would give me some clues, but so far i wasn't successful<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">1. the units depend on a lot of things.. from the user's DPI settings to the font (size) you specify in NSIS<br />
<br />
2. wouldn't ${NSD_CreateBitmap} do?  ${NSD_CreateButton} if you want a visible placeholder (well, I use the Button..could use anything that shows the rect of the control, really).</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, the control wouldn't be available on instfiles or i probably have more working adjusting a progressbar-plugin for every script i'm using<br />
<br />
i was hoping it could be done using nsis code, but if mui depends on more than that, i will stay away from my idea. maybe using the reshacker commandline to add or switch an image is the easier solution. or modifying mui itself.</div></div><hr />
