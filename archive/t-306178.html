<br />
<br />
I am looking for some help with adding the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 to my installer.<br />
<br />
As I am still new to all this.  And so I am a little lost.<br />
<br />
Here is the plan.  My app will need to have &quot;.NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1&quot; installed to run.  So I wish to have it installed at the same time as my app.  Can this be done and if so, How?<br />
<br />
I Would ask that you please respond in a manner that you are talking to a silly noob.<br />
<br />
Hope somebody can help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Oddsodz<br />
<br />
PS I have added my .nsi file so you can what I am doing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PGB99</div><div class="date">14th December 2009, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone point me to some code that checks to see if 3.5 SP1 is already installed?  All of the wiki entries and sample code in the help files are very old and the code will not work anymore, Microsoft has changed what is stored in the Registry.  It might be simple to change the scripts, but I am totally new to this and can't get it to work.</div></div><hr />

Just run the .NET installer and it will take care of it for you. If it is already there, it should just exit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, I don't understand - What.NET installer do you mean?  Is that a section of script that I copy into my script?  Or a separate application?</div></div><hr />
