i'm new with this super free installer, thanks to developers for great work, well done!<br />
<br />
My very simple question is:<br />
<br />
I would like that my installer became aware an application was already installed and asked to user to delete the already installed app before proceed with installation process...<br />
<br />
I hope I was clear...<br />
Any hints, tutorial, something?<br />
Thanks in advance and best regards<br />
Gamby</div></div><hr />

If you know the proper reg key, you can simply check the registry. Usually the install path is also saved in the registry. So in case the app is already installed, it should be easy to detect and run it's uninstaller...</div></div><hr />
