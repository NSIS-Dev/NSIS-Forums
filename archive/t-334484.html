<br />
Having a bit of trouble getting along with nsDialogs. I want a page to show up at the start (no trouble) and then only display a certain page if a specific button is pressed.<br />
<br />
My code will become quite complex at the end with lots of different pathways depending on what you click so I thought I would start off simple but I can't get it going. I've attached my code. The code compiles OK but when I run the file and press the button I get 'Dialogs.exe has stopped working'.<br />
<br />
I want to use nsDialogs because it gives lots of control over the layout.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that I'm doing something daft, I started from the examples but may be trying to do things the wrong way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
Cheers,<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />

<br />
So using RelGotoPage will take me forward or back a number of pages by using certain number, is there anyway to do it by name?</div></div><hr />

Name? Pages don't have names (You can use a page type multiple times)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">7th September 2011, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you can only make relative jumps. What you can do is add a !define page_components 1 etc for each page, and then calculate the relative distance by subtracting the two defines. This way whenever you change the page order, or add/remove pages from your script, you only need to make changes to the defines, not to every single page jump command in your script.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benjohnson</div><div class="date">16th September 2011, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I would update how I managed to solve this in case it might help someone else.<br />
<br />
I put a bit of code in before I created my nsDialogs page which would abort the page if a value wasn't met, it would then move on to the next one. It was a bit of a bodge, but it did the trick. <br />
<br />
Function PageName<br />
	${If} $pageRequested != &quot;PageName&quot; ; if $pageRequested doesn't match the title of the page, don't show the page, move onto next page.<br />
		Abort<br />
	${EndIf}<br />
	nsDialogs::Create 1018<br />
.....<br />
<br />
I would use StrCpy to define the variable before loading the next page, using the page Leave function.</div></div><hr />
