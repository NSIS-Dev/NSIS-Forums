<br />
This installer is for a map pack which must be placed in a very specific directory to function.  I found some code to extract the correct directory from the registry/filesystem, but it only functions inside of &quot;section&quot; and thus I cannot use &quot;Page directory&quot; to let people edit the directory if it happens to be wrong.<br />
<br />
My question is:  Is there a way to allow a user to modify a variable created inside of &quot;Section,&quot; and if so, how can I do this?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm unfortunately very new to NSIS and will probably be fighting with this until I give up and just don't use an installer... lol.  This thing has been driving me nuts for weeks.</div></div><hr />

...What does that mean, exactly? If you StrCpy $INSTDIR in .onInit, the directory page will enter that value into the path field as the default. Unless you change the contents of $INSTDIR again at a later time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">19th January 2009, 01:29</div></div><div class="posttext">looks like you've got the code to copy the dynamic Steam Account-generated folder to $INSTDIR in your section?  you should put that StrCpy in .onInit after calling - and verifying the output from - Call GetSteamAccountName. ( actually, after the &quot;gogogo:&quot; label - no point in doing any code that may not actually get used.</div></div><hr />
