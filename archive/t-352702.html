** I would like to ask you if I'm structuring my project properly.<br />
<br />
Here's what to do the project:<br />
- You choose which components to install<br />
- The selected components are written in INI files<br />
- As the components are installed correctly, the ini file is updated<br />
- If some components require a restart, after restarting the installer knows which components have yet to be installed and proceed with the rest.<br />
<br />
I'm complicating my life? There is an easier way to achieve the same result?<br />
If not, you have any suggestions on how to implement it in practice (examples, functions, ...)?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">26th November 2012, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The method is fine, assuming the installer is run properly after each reboot. You could probably just put your installer, with some command line parameters, in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run , and then delete it again after reboot/rerun. This will make sure your installer is always executed at boot, until such time you're confident your installation was successful and you remove the Run entry.<br />
<br />
Question though: Are you sure you need to reboot inbetween components? It would make your life much easier if you'd just install all components first, and THEN reboot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly don't know. Is there a way to determine it?<br />
<br />
I need to install the AS400 client and after its service pack.<br />
Classical installation require a reboot.<br />
<br />
One more thing. Do you know a way to fill in the ini file based on the components selected?<br />
<br />
