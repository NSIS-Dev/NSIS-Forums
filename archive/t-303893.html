<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">14th March 2009, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The only 'problem' you'll run into is that you have to explicitly handle every file that you might add with a File command separately.  I.e. you can't use File &quot;somedir\*.*&quot; to include multiple files as there's no way to get, from that, which files would be included.<br />
<br />
You would have to compile the exact list of files to include - which you could do with another installer that you run before compiling the main installer.<br />
<br />
If it were at all possible to get callback functions for SetOutPath, File and WriteReg* (and any other commands that may implicitly affect the file system/registry), so that you can do some per-item checking on folders and files, I would certainly jump on it ;)</div></div><hr />
