<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boohiss</div><div class="date">2nd October 2005, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never created a VB app setup/deployment before, but the Package &amp; Deployment Wizard seems very lacking in features that I need, and NSIS seems like a very popular and well supported product.<br />
<br />
So now my problem is that I have no idea where to start with NSIS.  I know that my program is using some DLLs (including DAO) and some ActiveX OCXs.  I *think* I know which ones I'm using, but I'm afraid that I'll miss one.  Dependancy Walker is overloading me with information--I have no idea what I'm looking at.<br />
<br />
Then what do I do?  I noticed a couple of handy looking programs on the NSIS Wiki, but both are no longer for download (Quick Deployment Wizard 1.0 and some other .LST to .NSI program).  I guess I would like to get my hands on either of those if anyone has them.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, assume I'm a complete &quot;M$&quot; dunce of a developer  (I have read the NSIS docs and wiki though).  I have a VB app and I want to make a NSIS setup package.  Where do I start?</div></div><hr />
