<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rehevkor</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 05:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, I'm new to NSIS. I find it infinitely more appealing than the windows installer, and thanks to the excellent NSIS Workbench program I had little trouble creating my setup file. However, I want to add the .NET Framework detect script to my setup so that I can give the user a URL to download the framework and abort the installation. I just finished a huge program in VB.NET, but this scripting language is boggling me.<br />
<br />
Basically, what I need to know is how and where I should call this function in order to achieve the result I mentioned above. Anyone have some advice for me? :)<br />
<br />
Note: I did a search of the forums on this topic, and none of them answered my question.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rehevkor</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that; it's the .NET detect script I was referring to. I don't understand how to implement it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rehevkor</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it to work... sort of. I put the code near the top of the file, but it won't attempt to detect .NET until after the user clicks &quot;Install.&quot; I want it to detect, and if it fails, to pop up a message box right before the license screen. Where should I put the code to do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th July 2003, 13:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Put the function itself anywhere in the script and then put this code where you want to check for .NET:<br />
<br />
Call IsDotNETInstalled<br />
Pop $0<br />
StrCmp $0 1 +3<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK &quot;no .NET bla bla&quot;<br />
  Abort<br />
<br />
You'd probably want to put this in .onInit.</div></div><hr />
