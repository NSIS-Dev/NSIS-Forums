<br />
I Am Just A Newbie here<br />
<br />
So All I Wanted Is A Script To Have Following Pages<br />
<br />
1] Splash Image<br />
<br />
2] Liscence<br />
<br />
3] Folder (My Files)<br />
<br />
4] The Most Important Thing SPLIT FILES<br />
<br />
Ive Tried In Examples But No Luck<br />
<br />
The Script Which Is Gonna Be Posted , Could It Be Modified With HM NIS edit ??<br />
<br />
Ive Saw That Everytime A Large Setup Is Compiled Error Comes Of Compilation :mad:<br />
could Splitting Files Solve That ??? :tinfoil:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">12th September 2010, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Like we told you before, please do not capitalize every word. It makes your post sound like it was typed by a six year old, and a rather obnoxious one at that.<br />
<br />
To learn NSIS, start by looking at NSIS\Examples\Example1.nsi and Example2.nsi, and find out what every command does exactly. Once you entirely understand the examples, you can move forward.<br />
<br />
Search the forums for information about splash images. As for splitting setup, you can use one of the CAB plugins, or just use CopyFiles (that is, store your files plainly on the DVD or in the zip). Once again, searching helps.</div></div><hr />
