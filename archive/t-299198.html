<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saschagottfried</div><div class="date">27th October 2008, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
I stumbled over an uncommon situation where the MUI-builtin MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY (I am still using MUI.nsh Version 1) did not choose the proper disk for space calculation in target directory. <br />
<br />
There is the following directory structure on his Windows 2003 File-Cluster. I do not know how to setup such things, but it seems to be some kind of mounting several disks to create such a directory structure. But this is not the subject of this thread. Obviously this seems to be possible with this OS.<br />
<br />
W: &lt;first disk - old harddisk with capacity of 13MB&gt;<br />
W:\GSI$GSIRoot  &lt;second disk - lots of GB space&gt;<br />
W:\GSI$GSIRoot\Application\Setups &lt;third disk - lots of GB space&gt;<br />
<br />
The target directory is:<br />
W:\GSI$GSIRoot\Application\Setups\Programs\Other\VDE-Normen\VDE 8.0<br />
<br />
That means it is addresses a folder on the third hdd with lots of space. The MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY however DOES NOT ENABLE the 'NEXT' button and shows a free space of 13MB. Apparently the calculation of space is always using the root of the path - what is working in 99.9 % of all use cases. But here it maps to the 13 MB disk, instead of detecting this uncommon directory mapping to the big harddisk. <br />
<br />
I used MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VERIFYONLEAVE to ship around that and offered an IGNORE button to continue. But until today I thought the builtin MUI page could handle it all. <br />
<br />
Is it possible for NSIS to detect such situations? What about other installers - are those aware of such things? Is anyone familiar with this situation? It would appreciate when the answer to this question will be merged into the NSIS MUI code, thus everybody can create installers that pass such situations as well.</div></div><hr />

I want to emphasize that this reported behaviour of NSIS could be a next item on the bug tracker. I would like some of the forum senior members to comment this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th November 2008, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Which version of NSIS are you using? This should already be working fine on the latest versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saschagottfried</div><div class="date">8th November 2008, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks kichik for taking care of my concerns...<br />
<br />
The NSIS version that compiled this setup was either 2.36 or 2.37<br />
<br />
I my previous posts I did not highlighted that much that a major customer of my company has reported this behaviour and sent me screenshots showing the behaviour I reported in detail. That's why I was not able to test or reproduce it in the meantime and decided to ask the community first of all. <br />
<br />
What can I do next to help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th November 2008, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">It was fixed in 2.38, so try building a new installer with the latest version and have them test it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was definitely the bug you mentioned. Thanks for being a reliable part of this community.</div></div><hr />
