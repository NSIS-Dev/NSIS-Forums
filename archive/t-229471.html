<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John P.</div><div class="date">27th October 2005, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an installer that contains hundreds of files.<br />
<br />
So in an attempt to organize the compile-folder, I have made a lot of folders and categorized them, and put the corresponding files into them. So that instead of having hundreds of files floating around in the compiler environment, I have a dousin folders with the files in them.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering about, is what is the most efficient way of extracting the contents of these folders, when I include them in the installer?<br />
<br />
I guess I can do a:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
File /r &quot;A_Folder&quot;<br />
CopyFiles &quot;$INSTDIR\A_Folder\FileA.bmp&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\FileA.bmp&quot;<br />
<br />
[many more folders and files in the same manner here]<br />
<br />
RMDir /r &quot;$INSTDIR\A_Folder&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
but since we're talking hundreds of files and a dousin folders here, that would be very inefficient; extracting the whole folder first, then copying out the content, and lastly removing the folder again.<br />
<br />
So there must be an easier, more efficient way that I can tell the installer that &quot;this folder and it's files are to be included, and the contents of the folder is to be extracted to this path&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's an quick and easy piece of code I can use for this, but what is it?</div></div><hr />

-As I thought, it would be embarrassingly simple... :o <br />
<br />
Well - didn't think it would be this embarrassingly simple, but....<br />
<br />
<br />
Well - thanks a lot. :) Now my installer won't be all clunky.</div></div><hr />
