<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalnos</div><div class="date">27th April 2004, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok im currently composing this software bundle that comes with tons of folders and files and anyways I have a few questions. Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
[1]. Well my bundle has 140 folders and 3,104 files. I was wondering if there was an easier way to include all those folders/files instead of manually copying and pasting the &quot;InstallDir&quot; and &quot;File&quot; commands so that the installer would install them all. So is there?<br />
<br />
[2]. Is there a way to install services like for WinXP and how? Because I want to install the &quot;Apache&quot; service with NSIS and dont know how.<br />
<br />
[3]. Which compressions is better? ZLib, BZip2, or LZMA. And what are their differences?<br />
<br />
Thats it :P, If I have more then ill post them here.</div></div><hr />

1. See DOCs about File and parameter /r. You can add:<br />
<br />
File &quot;C:\path\*.*&quot; /r <br />
;Include all files and folders with relative paths.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. I think in the web archive are some examples. Try here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=385)<br />
<br />
3. Well I use BZIP2, but all are good ratio compression. Why don't compile different installers with different compressors.... ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalnos</div><div class="date">27th April 2004, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh 1 more thing, lets say I wanted to include like a page where you could pick what you wanted to install and what you didnt, like checkboxes. How would I do that?<br />
<br />
Sorry im a NSIS noob. &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
Oh and can somebody post a sample installation script, lets say the service was Apache and it was FOR EXAMPLE:<br />
C:\blah\apache.exe. What would I add to the .nsi script so that it would install the service and always run at boot up ?</div></div><hr />
