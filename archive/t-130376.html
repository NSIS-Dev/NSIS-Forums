<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thoste</div><div class="date">31st March 2003, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I have several sections in a successfully working NSIS script.<br />
<br />
However, all of the sections are listed during the installation<br />
with a check in a box before the section name.<br />
<br />
For certain sections I don't want that these sections should be<br />
checked by default (!). Read: the check in the tiny box should<br />
not appear. However the user should have the option to check these boxes manually.<br />
<br />
How do I code this ?<br />
<br />
Thx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">31st March 2003, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are using install types, then the first install type specifies what is selected by default (via the &quot;InSection n&quot; instructions). There isn't a way to select another install type trough scripting (yet).<br />
<br />
IMHO it should be possible to use &quot;InSection n&quot; without any &quot;InstType&quot; instructions to set what is selected and deselected by default.<br />
If this isn't possible, then I suggest that you use a &quot;section select/deselect&quot;-script (somewhere on this forum and in the archives, I think) before showing the component selection page. But be carefull: Let the script do this only once (on initialization, for example), or else the sections will be selected/deselected every time when the user clicks '&lt; Back' and 'Next &gt;' from the component page.</div></div><hr />

Be aware though that the macro to select a section is not working right on out of the box b3 (on CVS it does). To fix that replace &amp; with | on line 22.</div></div><hr />
