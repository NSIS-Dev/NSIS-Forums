I'd like to know your opinion on how to deploy system dlls used by my app that could be shared by other aplications.<br />
I found this thread :<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=248308&amp;highlight=system+dll<br />
<br />
But what I'd like to know is if it's considered a good approach to put those dlls in the INSTDIR rather than system32, in order to avoid conflicts with existing versions or problems when uninstalling.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
bye</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better in your application directory.<br />
<br />
If you must just use a directory structure something like {programfiles}{youorginization}{yourshardeddlls}<br />
and place your app in {programfiles}{youorginization}{yourapp}<br />
and reference the DLL by ..\{yourshardeddlls}\myown.dll</div></div><hr />

I was more interested in runtime libraries used by my Visual C++ application, then I found this<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixB.html<br />
that cleared my mind.<br />
I'm still thinking that maybe putting those dll in my app directory wouldn't be that bad.</div></div><hr />
