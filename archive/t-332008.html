Then if I manaully delete this folder, it is gone. That means the folder is not held by anyone. So why isn't it removed initially?</div></div><hr />

I will try what you suggested to see if I still have the same issue. Actually the issue that the folder is not removed doesn't happen every time. I am not sure whether it is caused by trying to remove a current working directory. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
