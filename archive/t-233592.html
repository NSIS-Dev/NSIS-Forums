<br />
I need to install MSDE along with my code,<br />
as NSIS doesn't support MSI/Merge Module<br />
type of installtion. <br />
<br />
I tried doing it Programatically using <br />
SQL-DMO but its only an administrative library.<br />
<br />
Please any one suggest how to Install MSDE<br />
using NSIS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />
<br />
Prasad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've just recently done this. Basically what I did is check the registry to see what (if any) instances of MSDE were installed. I require a particular instance, but if you don't then you can use my script with the instance name of MSSQLSERVER which is the default instance.<br />
<br />
You may have to adjust the script slightly to suit your needs, but I'm sure it'll give you a good enough idea.<br />
<br />
Script attached.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a small Issues in bundling<br />
the MSDE setup, its size is 70 MB.<br />
so my Application size will <br />
increase drastically.<br />
If i do the same thing with install shield<br />
it comes to 23 MB (MSDE+ Application).<br />
<br />
Please suggest any optimal solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SeanB</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 10:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, can't help you with that. I distribute my software by CD, and so it's easier for me to put MSDE on the CD itself and not make it part of the setup.exe.<br />
<br />
You could detect it and download it if required, but then you'd have to be sure that your end user has an internet connection, and not dial up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PadmanabaPrasad</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all your suggestions !!!!<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
Final clarification, <br />
will NSIS support MSI/ Merge module in <br />
Future Releases ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe, but certainly not in the near future. For now, you execute msiexec.exe to install MSI or merge modules.</div></div><hr />

Please suggest any optimal solution.  Have you tried using 7Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) to compress MSDE setup?<br />
<br />
Also, why MSDN and not the new SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/sql/)?</div></div><hr />

Maybe, but certainly not in the near future. For now, you execute msiexec.exe to install MSI or merge modules.  What would be required to support them?  A rearchitecture of NSIS, a plug-in, or other?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will use 'msiexec' that suits best<br />
for my requirement  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PadmanabaPrasad</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 06:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried using the 7-Zip <br />
but even then the size doesn't<br />
vary.And SQL Server 2005 Express Edition<br />
requires &quot;.Net framework&quot; to be installed.<br />
<br />
Actully we want the application to be run <br />
independent of .Net/ JRE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fretje</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Small question regarding the commandline parameters of the setup:<br />
What exactly means /qr+ ? And where have you found that?<br />
I have searched a lot on google, and all I can find was<br />
/qn (don't show any user interface) and /qb (show only basic interface)<br />
<br />
Also: Where did you find about that return value 8192?<br />
I found this site:<br />
<br />
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/msi/setup/error_codes.asp<br />
<br />
which tells a lot about errors, but never number 8192...<br />
<br />
I ask this because when installing on xp or server2k3, there's not always a reboot requirement... So I want to check for it before I set the RebootFlag in NSIS...</div></div><hr />

What would be required to support them?  A rearchitecture of NSIS, a plug-in, or other? I don't know what exactly it'd take, as I haven't looked too deeply into it. But I do know that it would surely take way more than a plug-in. At minimum, it'd require an abstraction of every writing method so that creating both self-contained executables and MSI packages is supported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">govmust</div><div class="date">21st August 2007, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've tried using code made by SeanB but to no avail. I keep getting an error Invalid command: registry::Read<br />
<br />
I've included d/l-ed Registry plugin from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Registry_plug-in and made<br />
!include &quot;Registry.nsh&quot; in my script.<br />
I'm using nsis 2.29<br />
Anyone having ideas?</div></div><hr />
