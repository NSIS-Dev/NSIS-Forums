<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John P.</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Read the bottom of my post - it seems my problem was more that OneSection doesn't work the way I want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though my scripts are pretty big nowadays, I would still say I'm a newbie, so bear with me...<br />
<br />
I was wondering how I can use many instances of the same function?<br />
<br />
I mean, in a script I'm making now, I've already used up the .onInit function, and the .onGUIInit function(the last one as a custom function).<br />
<br />
So I hear you say, &quot;well, why don't you just put your next function below the other inside the .onInit function?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well - I do that, but then the function that is &quot;on the bottom&quot; isn't used.<br />
<br />
What I'm doing is that I have one function .onInit that reads from some registry strings, and does a certain thing if it finds this and that.<br />
<br />
Now I need to put the &quot;one section&quot; function inside the .onInit function as well.<br />
<br />
But when I put the &quot;one section&quot; function part below my other function within .onInit, the one section function doesn't work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's how it looks with both functions inside .onInit:<br />
<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
        ReadRegStr $0 HKCU &quot;Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections&quot; &quot;01&quot;<br />
	${if} $0 == 1<br />
		!insertmacro UnselectSection ${Sec01}<br />
		SectionSetText ${Sec01} &quot;&quot;<br />
	${endif}<br />
<br />
	ReadRegStr $0 HKCU &quot;Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections&quot; &quot;02&quot;<br />
	${if} $0 == 1<br />
		!insertmacro UnselectSection ${Sec02}<br />
		SectionSetText ${Sec02} &quot;&quot;<br />
	${endif}<br />
<br />
	ReadRegStr $0 HKCU &quot;Software\${VER_NAME}\Sections&quot; &quot;03&quot;<br />
	${if} $0 == 1<br />
		!insertmacro UnselectSection ${Sec03}<br />
		SectionSetText ${Sec03} &quot;&quot;<br />
	${endif}<br />
<br />
StrCpy $1 ${Sec04}<br />
<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
The StrCpy $1 ${Sec04} is for the one section function, the rest is for the other.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that it doesn't matter if I have the StrCpy $1 ${Sec04} in there or not.<br />
<br />
What happens when the installer is run, is that when the components page is loaded the first time, the default component is checked.<br />
Then, if I check the optional component, they are both checked, which I don't want to happen.<br />
<br />
This seems to be because the StrCpy $1 ${Sec04} isn't used at all.<br />
<br />
After the initial checking of the optional component(after they are both checked), the &quot;one section&quot; function seems to work; when you then uncheck one, the other is checked and vice versa - but then it's a little too late, since I doubt users are going to check it more than once before they hit 'Next'.<br />
<br />
So what if I later have an even bigger script and need a lot of different functions to happen within .onInit - how do I do it?<br />
<br />
As I said I have made a custom function already, and if I try to make a similar one, it says it's already defined at compile time.<br />
<br />
-It seems that OneSection doesn't work like I want it to - that's the problem.<br />
<br />
I just removed the other code and only left StrCpy $1 ${Sec04} inside .onInit, and I get the same problem as before; on first load of the components page, both of those componens can be checked. I can't have that happening. Any other way?<br />
<br />
I have tried to !include setsections.nsh that someone suggested in another thread, but even though I rename the SEC4 etc. to the section names in my script, and put the function in the same place as I now do(below all my sections), I still get &quot;Sec04 not defined&quot; when compiling, which I don't get using OneSection.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />
