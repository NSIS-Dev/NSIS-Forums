hope you like them.<br />
oh, and i also accidently saved them to somewhere elso :)<br />
also the icons were 8 bit colored, that is unecessary IMHO, also for the installer icons...<br />

http://www.axialis.com/<br />
it has the most modern ui and nice photoshop export plugin, many functions and easy to use<br />
<br />
also programs i like for icon editing<br />
http://www.microangelo.us/ &lt;- microangelo<br />
<br />
http://www.cursorarts.com/ &lt;- iconforge, nice tool, looks old but has more functions than the two progs above</div></div><hr />

I attach the ones I use.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used my own 16x16 icon because I think it's nicer (3 objects on 16x16 pixels is too much).<br />
<br />
The 32x32 image is a generic classic installer icon, not only used by Microsoft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">but is it legal to modify the microsoft icon?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">i have taken a look through my downloads and saw wise installers and installshields with a rip off of the 32x32 version of this icons, but slightly modified. these setups don't include 16x16 versions. why? because that they when they created their windows 95 version of the installer they hadn't the knowledge of integrating the 16x16 icon in their setup. please, don't use your own icon because it was missing in these rip offs (hm, is it the right way of writing that?), why not go back to the root and take the modified version of the original ms logo i made. i don't say that i don't like your icon, but in my eyes (the setup icon is also used in newest directx version) these two doesn't fit right together. why not create a 32x32 version for your 16x16 icon? i really like the 16x16 version you made, but they don't fit together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The 32x32 is not a very generic classic installer icon, many companies use this one.<br />
<br />
Because MS created this ugly 16x16 icon with a lot of objects on a small space, that does not mean we should copy it. I think the current icons fit perfectly together (same style).<br />
<br />
MS guideline:<br />
If combining multiple objects into one image in an icon, consider how the image will scale to smaller sizes. We suggest that you use no more than three objects in an icon. For the 16 Ã— 16 size, you can also consider removing objects or simplifying the image to improve recognition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">to improve recognition right, but don't you recognize what the things on the 16x16 icon are? whats wrong to have a alternate version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It's quite difficult to recognize that icon. It's even more difficult than the MS icon above, because you have added another object.<br />
<br />
You can offer alternative icons on an archive page, but I'm not going to add tons of icons with small modifications to the distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">not tons of icons but an official setup icon? i didn't want to offend you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">also, i don't want to start a fight about the icons on the board, but maybe it's just cause you haven't said &quot;thank you&quot; or whatever for my uninstaller icon in any way. also i don't want to force my icons to nsis, i wouldn't have created them when your previous post from 09-30-2003 05:41 PM which hasn't clearly said that you wanted to make the icon on your own until you edited it, but this time i already wrote my post with modified icons, so i haven't seen the updated post. so i hope you can understand why i started to post updated setup icons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I think you understood me wrong. :) Hey, I'm not trying to start a fight or anything like that :D<br />
<br />
I was just trying to say that I what to limit the amount of included icons. Previously there were a lot of low-quality icons in the distribution, so I want to keep only a set of high-quality icons.<br />
<br />
The main set of icons are the new modern ones, created by a professional designer. For the people who want something different or want it to be as small as possible, some other icons will also be provided.<br />
<br />
I don't think this icon is the current &quot;official&quot; setup icon. I also don't want to copy any existing icons, there should just be a set of nice NSIS icons.<br />
<br />
Trying to put everything in the 16x16 icons makes it difficult to recognize. Icons should be as simple as possible. That's why I think it's better to only use the computer image on the small icon.<br />
<br />
If you have missed a &quot;thank you&quot;, here it is :) Of couse I really appreaciate any contributions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Please create an archive page for your icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">4th October 2003, 05:14</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, here's the page:<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=432&amp;instances=0<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I understand that you want to limit the number of icons, but this icon matches the header &quot;win.bmp&quot; which is included. Also this icon is high resolution.<br />
<br />
You probably know all this, but maybe not ;)</div></div><hr />
