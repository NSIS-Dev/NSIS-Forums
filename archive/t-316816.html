<br />
I have a multi-language installer M which displays a list of multi-language applications. After user select which applications they want, we will silently install those applications. These applications (setup.exe files) are not compressed with installer M, they resides in external folder.<br />
<br />
The situation I am in is: If user select to run installer M in  Spanish, we would like to have selected applications to be installed in Spanish also. Currently, selected applications are installed in English.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion on how I can do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
A. check if those applications support a language switch on their command-line.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B. check if they get language information from the registry somewhere (i.e. previous installs; but beware that some installers check for the existence of a key and may think the program is already installed if you create this key + language value)<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
C. Temporarily change the locale of the user's windows settings in the registry - as this is what most 'smart' installers will default to choosing if run manually.  Also rather iffy.</div></div><hr />
