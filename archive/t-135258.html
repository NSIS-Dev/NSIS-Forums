<br />
I try to run Uninstall.exe from MySetup.exe on .onInit<br />
(in case there is an older ver - so I can uninstall it...)<br />
<br />
4 some reason I could not Hide the MySetup.exe window<br />
(maybe coz it's the same as Uninstall.exe)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, now I'm trying to hold on some loop so the user can<br />
use Uninstall.exe and ONLY when uninstalled OR canceled<br />
he will B able 2 continue back 2 the future (MySetup.exe)<br />
<br />
I created a string to a temp file: &quot;$TEMP\${strTempFileName}&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me produce this time machine (Guidlines | Help | Cookies) ?</div></div><hr />

Use ExecWait, which will wait untill the program you run has been finished (canceled, finished or crashed (if it's a Microsoft product)). When that program has finished, your program will continue it's scripts.<br />
<br />
And b.t.w., since Uninstall.exe is a separate .exe-file, it isn't the same window as your MySetup.exe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know why, but it did not work in my case (2.0b3) on a BMPHeader...<br />
<br />
But - I just solved it with a flag file and a loopi loop<br />
<br />
I'll post the great art work in few minutes...</div></div><hr />
