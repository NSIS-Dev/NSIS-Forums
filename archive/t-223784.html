<br />
You need two InstFiles pages.<br />
You need to unselect the second Section before showing the first InstFiles page, and unselect the first SectionGroup before showing the second InstFiles page.<br />
Use the SelectSection and UnselectSection macro's in Sections.nsh to select and unselect the Sections.<br />

Can you please give me an example of a code where you use the SelectSection and UnselectSection macro's. You can find my code below if that can help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th August 2005, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll make an example.<br />
<br />
Edit: Had a go and it gets very complicated because you also need to remember which sections were originally selected.<br />
You'd be better off sticking with one InstFiles page until support for this is added properly (hard coded into NSIS).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stb</div><div class="date">12th August 2005, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">@Tupsan: Why do you want to do this? <br />
<br />
I know this is no helpful answer, but maybe the installer can be designed some other way. In fact I think it is a good idea in general to have some steps asking the user what he wants and then some install phase which only stops on errors (which means: no interaction in general).<br />
<br />
I can imagine situations where your wish seems essential. But maybe we can find a satisfying solution for this, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of using a section to install the first part of the files, you do so with another function and a progress bar on a custom page that would start BEFORE you call the instfiles page.<br />
<br />
There are a few banner plugins you could use on the Wiki to display a progress bar in a pop-up window  Or you could try using the InstallOptionsEx plugin since it has a progress bar function included with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A progresbar seems to be a good thing. Is there a syntax to implement a progresbar. Please take a look at my code and tell me if I can implement a progresbar. <br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">16th August 2005, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to use InstallOptionsEx to create a custom page with a progress bar, or use the NXS plugin.<br />
Search the forums for both.<br />
