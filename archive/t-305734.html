<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panarchy</div><div class="date">26th April 2009, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
<br />
How do I make the icon (actual image) background transparent?<br />
<br />
I would like to know how to do this using either C++ or NSIS.<br />
<br />
To be more specific, with a blue wallpaper, using the exact same installation wizard, the computer icon looks different.<br />
<br />
Exhibit A  http://http.cdnlayer.com/dreamincode/forums/style_emoticons/default/icon_up.gif <br />
<br />

<br />
Exhibit B  http://http.cdnlayer.com/dreamincode/forums/style_emoticons/default/icon_down.gif <br />
<br />
http://i42.tinypic.com/34sgsvo.jpg<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make (through registry changes perhaps?) the change from Exhibit B to Exhibit A automatically?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how this could be achieved would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

There are several free icon editors out there, checkout http://icofx.ro/ or http://www.snapfiles.com/get/gficoneditor.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panarchy</div><div class="date">26th April 2009, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello.<br />
<br />
The actual .ico is A-OK (fine).<br />
<br />
On some of the computers I go on, and install the program, the icon looks different. On some computer the icon has transparency, on some it just doesn't. The exact same installer is being used.<br />
<br />
Please tell me how I can make the icon transparent for the Computers that don't make icons transparent by default.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">26th April 2009, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I still say your icon is broken. If you only have a 32bit color version in there, you might see some problems on older systems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panarchy</div><div class="date">26th April 2009, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">All operating systems I've tested this on are Windows Server 2003.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">26th April 2009, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">If other windows icons are also broken, there is something wrong with windows or your graphics driver. If only your icon has the problem, then your icon is broken, use one of the icon editors I linked to</div></div><hr />

NSIS's fault?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panarchy</div><div class="date">27th April 2009, 03:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno!<br />
<br />
Created the icon from the png with a different online image editor/converter, yet it wasn't giving me the different dimensions on the actual .exe (it was on the .ico though).<br />
This also includes the installer itself, as well as the program.<br />
<br />
(that is, it didn't work for anything but the .ico)<br />
<br />
However, when testing it on the computer in question, it just worked.<br />
<br />
A little overly outlined, but nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
So it just all works now!<br />
<br />
Pretty confusing, eh?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Personally, I'm a huge fan of IconBuilder (http://iconfactory.com/software/iconbuilder_xp). They make versions of it for Windows and Mac, and it's only about fifty bucks. (Compared to the hours you can spend with trying to make lesser tools work [especially free online tools, as great as sites like iConvert (http://eisbox.net/iconvert/) are...], over time, it's a bargain...)<br />
<br />
Only problem is that it requires an Adobe/Macromedia app (Photoshop, Elements, and/or Fireworks). But, again, you probably have or will obtain a copy of one of them if you do lots of icon work, as I know few people who use open source apps for serious icon design. (In fact, I know quite a few people who do their icon work in Illustrator and paste the vectors into Photoshop...)<br />
<br />
(Note: I'm not at all affiliated with Iconfactory, Adobe, or any other company mentioned in this post... Just a satisfied customer who gladly doesn't have many icon issues anymore. ;))<br />
<br />
But, I'm glad you got it working! :D</div></div><hr />
