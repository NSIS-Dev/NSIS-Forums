It simply doesn't sort! before posting here I decided to look at the examples provided with the plugin and even the sort.nsi script provided doesn't do anything. The debug screen before and after ${TestArray-&gt;Sort} &quot;&quot; are exactly the same.<br />

Has anyone had this problem? <br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

I'll have a look.<br />
<br />
Edit: You are correct. The sort function is broken, and it was broken when new code was added to sort one array by another.<br />
I'll upload v0.9 soon.<br />

<br />
You may have noticed (or not) that the Sort function was falsely throwing the &quot;(3) Index out of range.&quot; error message (which you'd find by checking the $ArrayErr variable). This told me exactly where the problem was thankfully.<br />
The function throws this error message when using two sorting arrays and when the two arrays are not equal in size.<br />

<br />
I'd also like to know if the arrays are limited to 32 columns? I tried setting the size to larger numbers, but it seems limited to 32.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">See section 1.10 Array sizes in the documentation (Docs\NSISArray\)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">johnny44</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry....I read the readme until the function definitions. Didn't see 2 of the most important sections for me, array sizes and error messages. Mea culpa....<br />
<br />
As for custom Arrays, 256 items would be enough in my case, 128 is a bit short. I ain't no programmer and I don't have the tools to recompile so I'm gonna work with 128, unless it takes only 2 seconds for you to recompile for 256 items and 128 characters. That would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Could you also test the IsFull function? I tried using it and it never jumped to the full label. It's not major since I went around the problem using StrCmp $ArrayErr &quot;3&quot; flush 0<br />
<br />
Thanks to your help, my installer is now almost complete!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">johnny44</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to bug you again Stu, but can you also check the ReadToStack function. The ReadToStack.nsi example does not seem to work. It looks like an empty string is popped from the stack. Nothing comes out when using range 0 -1 but with 0 3 I get a blank item in between each item:<br />
<br />
item 0:<br />
item 1: one<br />
item 2:<br />
item 3:two<br />
<br />
I looked at $ArrayErr and it holds the first item (zero).<br />
<br />
If I leave the range at 0 3 and place<br />
<br />
!define ArrayErrorMsgBox<br />
<br />
at the beginning, it works. If I change the range back to 0 -1 and leave the !define, I get error message (3)index out of range. I hope this helps you find the problem.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Here's something else regarding the WriteList and WriteListC functions. I modified the Is.nsi example like this:<br />
<br />
!define FuncName 'Is Functions'<br />
name '${FuncName}'<br />
outfile 'ArrayExample - ${FuncName}.exe'<br />
caption '${FuncName}'<br />
!define ArrayErrorMsgBox<br />
!include NSISArray.nsh<br />

  ${TestArray-&gt;IsFull} +2 0<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;TestArray is NOT full!&quot;<br />

  ${TestArray-&gt;IsInRange} 3 0 +2<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;Index of 3 is in range of TestArray!&quot;<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;Testing 'IsInRange' again...&quot;<br />
  ${TestArray-&gt;IsInRange} 4 +2 0<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;Index of 4 is NOT in range of TestArray!&quot;<br />
  ${TestArray-&gt;Delete}<br />
  ${ArrayUnload}<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />

<br />
The WriteList and WriteListC functions do not seem to care about the 32 items limit. The debug screen shows all 36 items and all of them are passed to the concatenation function.<br />
Notice that the IsFull function still shows up as non-full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 23:35</div></div><div class="posttext">My goodness. It appears that lstrcpy redimensions the array. In other words it doesn't matter what index of the array you write to... it will still be written. I wrote to an index of 99 of a 32 dimension array and the value that I wrote is returned when refering to that index.<br />
<br />
Therefore it seems that there is not limit to the number of items in the array. I'm now going to see if there's really a limit to the number of arrays that you can have.<br />
<br />
I've fixed all the other problems, but this appears to be even more major.<br />
<br />
Edit: In some cases it writes the data successfully, but in others either no data is written or the installer crashes. Therefore I'm going to stick to having fixed sized arrays like it should be (I'll make WriteList induce Index out of range error if there are too many items to be written).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Done.<br />
IsFull was failing because you wrote &gt;32 items to a 32 item array. IsFull does a less than or equal to comparison, not a greater than.<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/File:NSISArray.zip<br />
<br />
Edit: What array dimensions would you like for your custom DLL. NSISArray is 32 x 1024 strings. NSISArray128 is 128 x 256 strings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">johnny44</div><div class="date">5th December 2005, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Stu,<br />
<br />
The array size that would be best suited for my application is 256 items X 128 characters.<br />
<br />
I confirm that the IsFull function works great, but I'm still having problems with the ReadToStack example. If I don't modify anything I still get this<br />
<br />
Item 0:<br />
Item 1: one<br />
Item 2:<br />
Item 3: two<br />
<br />
When I change the range to 0 3 I get all empty strings. This is the opposite behavior from when I mentioned it to you in the first place.<br />
<br />
EDIT: **DELETED**<br />
<br />
EDIT2: My bad, !define ArrayPluginAll 128.[B]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the 256X128 array plugin. I tried it and it seems to work except in some weird cases where the first item is corrupted in my second array. I didn't do much testing on it though and it might just be me so don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
My script is going well and now I am to the point where I need to find out if an item is alredy there. I'm using the SearchI function and there seems to be a problem with it. Only the first 3 characters are compared. If they match, it returns the first matching index value.<br />
<br />
Could you look into it? The Search function seems to do the same thing. Here's a test script:<br />
<br />
!define FuncName 'SearchI'<br />
name '${FuncName}'<br />
outfile 'ArrayExample - ${FuncName}.exe'<br />

This test script shows weird characters at the end of the first item. The problem appears when used with WriteListC only. The 128 plugin seems to have a similar behaviour in this test script .EDIT: for the 128 plugin, only the first array has this problem. The second and subsequent arrays in your script will be fine.: WriteList, Push and Shift work OK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">6th December 2005, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Here it is. Took longer than expected mainly because there was more work needed than expected.<br />
<br />
The strange characters appearing on the end of the strings were caused by stack corruption (I think that is the correct term). I was getting the end of the actual &quot;WriteListC&quot; function name appended to my first array item (so it was &quot;oneListC&quot;)!<br />
I've fixed this problem by using using static variables throughout instead, and by clearing the contents of each static variable when finished with.<br />
This means the DLL's have increased in size a little (1KB) but all variables will be created when the function(s) are first ran, rather than every time they are ran.<br />
<br />
I've also fixed the Search and SearchI functions. The original code that I wrote was very dodgy (I must have been drunk or something!)<br />
<br />
I've also added a ${myArray-&gt;Print} instruction to the script header for debugging purposes.<br />
