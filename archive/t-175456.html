so pardon any possibly simple questions.<br />
<br />
I've not found in the help what I'm looking for because I think my question is too broad..<br />
<br />
Is there 1 place that contains the answers to such questions like:<br />
<br />
how do I change the color of something?<br />
it's size?<br />
it's font (for text)?<br />
How do I on Modern UI and original pages add images?<br />
how do I add on text in Modern UI and orginal pages?<br />
<br />
Now, when I say stuff like how do I change the color of something I mean for example, most the windows are grey in NSI,  what if I wanted a different shade?<br />
<br />
so, continuing the barrade of questions...<br />
<br />
How do I create a full background during the install (like wise does.  BTW wise is our primary install tool, and that's what I'm used to.  I'm evaluating NSI right now as an alternative)<br />
<br />
<br />
One other small thing?  I noticed that you can have multiple sections and then if you include the components page, that you can check/uncheck the sections you want installed.  What I want to know is, how can I have 2 or more component pages but show only certain sections in each.  sometimes we install multiple components and each have their own sections.  I could only get it to show all sections in all component pages.</div></div><hr />

Use SetCtlColors for colors, modify the UI resources to change dialogs, CreateFont for fonts...<br />
<br />
If you need unique sections on a component page you will have to hide/show sections in the pre function of the page.</div></div><hr />
