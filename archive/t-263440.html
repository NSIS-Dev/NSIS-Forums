<br />
I just got a bug report on my installer, with an error I could not reproduce. The installer downloads a file called mirrors.ini and puts the mirrors contained in that file in a drop-down menu on a preferences page.<br />
<br />
The user only got the first entry of the mirrors.ini file displayed, yet everyone else saw all the mirrors. I then gave him a special version with some debug popups and we came to the conclusion that he was indeed able to read the entire mirrors.ini file, yet the drop-down could only display the first entry.<br />
<br />
It turns out he was using Windows 2000 and that this was the problem, another user tried Windows 2000 and confirmed this.<br />
<br />
This is the iopreferences.ini part where Windows 2000 fails:<br />
<br />
[Field 3]<br />
Type=DropList<br />
ListItems=a|b|c<br />
Left=10<br />
Right=230<br />
Top=20<br />
Bottom=30<br />
State=a<br />
<br />
Windows 2000 only shows &quot;a&quot;, and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me any information on how to fix this? Is this an NSIS bug?</div></div><hr />

Note (2): For combobox or droplist, the &quot;bottom&quot; value is not used in the same way.<br />
In this case, the bottom value is the maximum size of the window when the pop-up list is being displayed. All other times, the combobox is automatically sized to be one element tall. If you have trouble where you can not see the combobox drop-down, then check the bottom value and ensure it is large enough. A rough guide for the height required is the number of items in the list multiplied by 8, plus 20.</div></div><hr />
