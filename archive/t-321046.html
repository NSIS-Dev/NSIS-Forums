<br />
I am new to NSIS, but i need to create an installation package. I have an exe file from last version of the tool i need to create a package for. I am pretty sure that exe file was created with NSIS.<br />
<br />
I guess what i am asking is this: can one figure out what exe file is actually going to do, so i can create a new installation package without missing anything that used to be installed as part of the installation package?<br />
<br />
I tried opening it in text editor... no luck ;0(<br />
<br />
Any helps, would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could use process monitor (or the older filemon/regmon) to figure out where the installer is writing/changing files/registry values, though)<br />
<br />
you can't really extract the code that the installer goes through when you run it, though.  So if there's specific behavior, you'd likely have to deduce that yourself.</div></div><hr />
