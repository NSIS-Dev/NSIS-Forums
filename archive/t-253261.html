<br />
I have been following this forum closely, and it has answered all my previous questions with NSIS, but this one has be stumped.<br />
<br />
My installer installs 2 windows services, sets them to autorun and sets one to be dependant on the other.<br />
<br />
I use ServiceLib to create the services and the registry DLL to update the registry to set the dependancies. <br />
<br />
The services are installed and they start up fine, but even those they SAY they are dependant on each other in the service properties this is not the actual case.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else accomplished something similar to what I am trying to do? Please share your experiences!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time. :D<br />
<br />

<br />
Once the dependancies are set up, you will have to reboot the system for them to truely take effect. I was not doing this initially.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps anyone else. :)</div></div><hr />
