<br />
The OpenSC Project [1] needs help in developing and installing NSIS package for Windows users.<br />
<br />
We rewrote our build system to be able to produce Windows binaries using MinGW32 into ordered tree. This build system can build OpenSC using MSYS or using cross compiler on different OS.<br />
<br />
The installer component is missing.<br />
<br />
As we don't have any developer which is interested in Windows specific development, I thought I request help from you guys.<br />
<br />
It would be great if someone with NSIS knowledge is willing to help create the installer.<br />
<br />
What I thought is the following basic design:<br />
<br />
1. Modify etc/opensc.conf profile_dir to match PREFIX/share/opensc<br />
<br />
2. Put HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenSC\ConfigFile REG_SZ Path to PREFIX/etc/opensc.conf<br />
<br />
3. Put HKLM\Software\PKCS11-Spy\Module REG_SZ Path to PREFIX/bin/opensc-pkcs11.dll<br />
<br />
4. Categories:<br />
Base: bin/*, sbin/*, lib/pkcs11/*, share/opensc/*, share/doc/scb/*, etc/*<br />
Engine_PKCS11: lib/engines/engine_pkcs11.dll<br />
Documentation: share/doc/*, share/info/*	<br />
Development files: *.h, *.a, *.def, *.la, *.pc, share/aclocal/*, share/libtool/*<br />
Sources: src/*<br />
OpenSSL engines: lib/engines<br />
OpenSSL extra: ssl/*<br />
<br />
Attached is the file list so you know what you are dealing with. Please note that I don't want to be dependent on a specific file, so if I modify the build system and add a new file it will be installed by one of these categories.<br />
<br />
Also please note that cross build of this package is required (for example, build on Linux).<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
