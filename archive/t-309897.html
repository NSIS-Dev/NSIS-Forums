<br />
  I have search the google and this forum about this and I can't find a definite answer. Does anyone here know how windows installer(MSI) handles the uninstallation of the application in the Add/Remove program?<br />
<br />
I really thought that it will just call the command found in the uninstallString key in the registry. But even I remove this entry I can still uninstall the application using the Add/Remove programs.<br />
<br />
BTW this is the value of the uninstallString of my application. <br />
MsiExec.exe /I{82E46E8B-A4E8-49A2-9B38-3C94C6AF2F8A}<br />
And if this is the command called when pressing remove button in the Add/Remove program menu, Why is it the switch is /I which I think is wrong because the correct switch to uninstall an MSI created application is /X. Right?<br />
<br />
I really need help on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Yelkrebb.</div></div><hr />

See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/227091<br />
<br />
So replace /I with /x to remove the application instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wanted to override the functionality of the remove button in the Add/Remove program entry of my application.<br />
<br />
I thought that the UninstallString entry in the registry was the one called when I click the remove in the Add/Remove program. But I think it's not, because even I delete this string value I was able to uninstall my application succesfully. So it made me think that the remove button in the Add/Remove program doesn't rely on this UninstallString value in the registry.</div></div><hr />

Some programs put their uninstall info there.</div></div><hr />
