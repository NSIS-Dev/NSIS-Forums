<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">As you'll propably know from the other thread: &quot;NSIS Script Editor&quot;, I am developing a Script Editor for NSIS that makes creating scripts a lot easier. N.I.C.E. means NSIS Installation Creator/Editor. Since I am going to rewrite the whole program in C#, I'd like to know what features you want to see (even those that you already saw in other (NSIS) editors). A few that will be implemented are:<br />
<br />
 Syntax highlighting<br />
 New project wizard<br />
 Template scripts (to install .exe, plugins, etc..)<br />
 Syntax correction (When hitting enter on a line containing a false instruction, it replaces it)<br />
 Compile errors and warnings (shows them beneath your project)<br />
 NSIS Project (manage multiple files in one project)<br />
 Language file editor<br />
 Wizards for common tasks (like File, etc..)<br />
 Plugin insert wizard<br />
 Auto update (NSIS and N.I.C.E. from the internet (via CVS if you want))<br />
 Show possible parameters (simple, shows the syntax under the line you are typing in)<br />
 Show possible parameters (extended, shows possible parameter values for the instructions)<br />
 XML-compiling (XML-loading will be fatser)<br />
 Autocomplete (When you start typing an instruction, N.I.C.E. completes it)<br />
 Compile from program (with NSIS, no compiler setup)<br />
 Shortcut keys (F5 for compiling for example)<br />
 Find and Replace<br />
 Autosave (every n minutes)<br />
 Line numbers, character spacing (Row 12, Col 45)<br />
 Sidebar with functions, help and project information.<br />
 Comment complete block (out)<br />
 Script rewriting (removes all the spaces and tabs from the beginning of the lines and add them again, for nice code-readability)<br />
 Save comments, author and other information with the project (or script)<br />
 Standard text-editor functions (copy, paste, etc...)<br />
 Follow label-, function- and macro-pointers (double click on a macro name to see the definition)<br />
<br />
Long list, don't you think? If you have anything to add, thing I must implement, thing I never should implement, etc.., let me know!</div></div><hr />

What are you scared for? .Net sounds great (according to the .Net magazine :o)<br />
By the way, I haven't programmed any program yet in C#.<br />
Do you have any other suggestion of programming language, or should I stick to VB6, which doesn't meet my requirements any more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The main problem with .net for desktop use is the 20MB+ runtime, also it doesn't work on older versions of Windows (can't remember if that's just Win95 or also Win98).<br />
<br />
Personally not sure if it's really worth people simply writing n different text editors for NSIS. It's great that you're prepared to spend the time and effort but what it could really do with is a proper gui linked to the editor in the same way as Wise and Installshield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The .NET Frameworks works on all Win32 versions except Windows 95, but that's not a real problems, it's 7 years old.<br />
<br />
I also think that there are enough text editors now. It's better to combine efforts to write a good GUI linked to the script.</div></div><hr />

- Let you step through your code as it executes, with the option of express-executing (i.e. without stepping through) a function or section.<br />
- Display the current contents of the stack, user-variables, and NSIS variables.</div></div><hr />

This is not possible since the NSIS compiler doesn't support it. It might be an idea for NSIS 3.0, but until then, I won't even try to support it. It's way to difficult.</div></div><hr />
