Can someone point me in the right direction? If possible Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">viper0179</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you should give more information about what you're trying to do and what you mean by a dependancy file. I'm sure there's a function in NSIS somewhere for it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cjs</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">whoops, a little braindead this morning.<br />
<br />
I havn't found the option in NSIS to incorporate a DEP file, for including DLL's in a package I am creating. <br />
<br />
I have searched the forum and FAQ too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS cannot do that yet nor am I aware of a plugin that will give you that information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cjs</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the help..i guess i'll have to figure out a diff. way.<br />
<br />
do you understand what i was trying to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Please give some more details. What do you want to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cjs</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not a programmer, I was given the task to create a packager for our software, I will do my best.<br />
<br />
I guess the question is how do I tell NSIS that I want to use a dependency file: telling the packager what DLL's to include in the compiled install program. I have included the DEP file. If you can make out what I was trying to convey that is great.<br />
<br />
the extention of this file was supposed to be .DEP but VBB will only let you upload certian file-types. so I renamed it to TXT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. for example..I use Visual Basic 6. So my apps need the VB6 Runtime, then I distribute it within the app.<br />
Maybe if you detect the files that you need in the end-user machine and detect wich doesn't installed... then you can use nsisdl plugin<br />
to download'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">You can find all the names of the DLL's in the file.<br />
<br />
Check which DLL's do not exist by default and use the UpgradeDLL macro to upgrade the others. The macro is available in the documentation/archive.</div></div><hr />
