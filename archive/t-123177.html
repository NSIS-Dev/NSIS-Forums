<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">christophw</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 08:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Our new release of SharpDevelop forces us to register an assembly into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). The utility to use is gacutil.exe, which on some machines is in the path, while on others, it isn't (Runtime-only or VS.NET machines). Though I know where to find (some) path information in the registry, does anyone by chance have solved this issue already and is willing to share their code?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">christophw</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The utility IS on every .NET machine, runtime or sdk. But only the SDK registers the path to the utility in the path variable.<br />

<br />
Isn't there some key in the registry that holds the .NET directory path? Maybe an environment variable... HKCR\Applications contains paths to some programs, maybe it's there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">christophw</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">There are registry keys, however, I yet have to find a document outlining which ones to combine to get the path, there are a few combinations possible (especially when .NET v1.0 and v1.1 are on the machine). I personally do not want to resort to write a managed application (there's a property on a class that gives you the path) just to start gacutil...<br />
