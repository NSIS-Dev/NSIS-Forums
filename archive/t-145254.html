<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">9th August 2003, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found a problem with my MUI-based installer after updating to the 9 August 2003 (13:44 GMT) CVS snapshot. I have a custom page just before the 'Finish' page. If the 'Back' button on the 'Finish' page is clicked, the custom page re-appears but the title and subtitle text is missing (the text was there the first time the custom page was displayed).<br />
<br />
If I go back to the 4 August 2003 (07:44 GMT) snapshot and re-compile my script, the custom page is shown correctly when the 'Back' button is used on the 'Finish' page.<br />
<br />
Attached is a modified version of the standard 'WelcomeFinish.nsi' script which exhibits the same problem as my installer: it works with 4 August snapshot but does not work with the 9 August one.<br />
<br />
According to the Changelog, there is no more up-to-date InstallOptions DLL (but it seems the source has been modified since the DLL was last built).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for fixing it so quickly.</div></div><hr />
