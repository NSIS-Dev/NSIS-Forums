<br />
I am working on an un/installer for a program that contains a dll that gets locked by explorer.exe.  When I try to uninstall the application, and delete the dll, it fails (it's locked) and I get a pop up error in the uninstaller.  Does NSIS provide mecahnism to deal with this problem (perhaps by queueing the file for removal on reboot)?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

If it is something you created then write the DLL to disassociate it's self from the explorer.exe on a kill statement. Other than that, to make sure that you don't piss off your downloaders, then don't delete it. If you know that you are getting in to trouble, then you could be screwed.<br />

It is something we created in house, not vital.<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean by getting screwed.  It is something that if it wasn't there after a reboot there would be no problem...<br />
<br />
Where would this kill statement you mention get launched from?  No one is attempting to kill the explorer process.  <br />
