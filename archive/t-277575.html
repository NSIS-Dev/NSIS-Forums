<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jim M</div><div class="date">19th September 2007, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on a .nsi file that is being used to create a setup file which will install a program. We need to make sure our customers have Flash installed.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to create a MUI that will check to see if a user has the most current version MacroMedia Flash. Through research, I found the Function &quot;IsFlashInstalled.&quot;<br />
<br />
My problem is, after the .nsi file is compiled and I execute the setup file, the MUI does seem to check or notify me that I have a current release of Flash.<br />
<br />
My question is...Will the MUI only notify me if I don't have the current version Flash (or if I don't have Flash) installed or is there something else I need to do (to add) in the .nsi file and then compile it again?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jim M</div><div class="date">28th September 2007, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that I have the MUI checking to see if Flash is installed in our customer's system, I need to load the current version of Flash into their system.<br />
<br />
I have the MUI setup to exec the .exe of Flash 9, but it just seems to put it into the system32 folder; it does not &quot;load&quot; Flash into the system - at least, so our customers could use our program.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to actually load Flash into a system using the MUI? I am wanting to make this as easy and as seemless as possible for our customers.</div></div><hr />
