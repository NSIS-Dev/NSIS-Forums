<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed this both on install and uninstall using SectionGroups. It seems if nothing is selected, all checkboxes are grayed out as if something is indeed selected. But, this is not the case.<br />
<br />
Is this normal or do I still have to update my code to comply with this new behaviour? I need enlightenment :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the same exact code (except it was SubSection/End) didn't produce this. I left SubSection/end for 2.0.5 and thought maybe SectionGroup/End would fix it but no cigar :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the code you're using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">5th March 2005, 00:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried duplicating the bug by creating some sample code. I now know exactly what is causing the problem. Now, either this was a bug in 2.0.4 or it is a bug in 2.0.5.<br />
<br />
I've had SectionGroups and within them, more SectionGroups. Within these special groups I had several types of section.<br />
<br />
1. Sections a user can install or not install.<br />
2. Sections hidden yet belonging to a special Install Type.<br />
3. Sections which belonged to no Install Type but which were hidden.<br />
<br />
The bug is in #3. My question is, was this a bug in 2.0.4 which is now fixed or is it a bug in 2.0.5?</div></div><hr />

From 2.05 change log:Invisible sections weren't always affected by a change of the installation type (bug #1045722)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">5th March 2005, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually thought this was a feature as I used this as one. Happy to know it was a bug as it made me clean up my code a bit more.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info Kichik!</div></div><hr />
