<br />
My installer sets the Name to an English string for this localized language.  When the string shows up in the header area (in MUI), there are quotes around the name - but only in Simplified Chinese.  The name showing up in the text on the checkbox on the license page doesn't have these quotes, though, so I'm not sure what's going on.  Any help or telling me that's as designed would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">3rd October 2006, 20:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the MUI language files for Simplified Chinese and didn't notice any extra quotes around the $(^Name) variable and my translation is just the English for this string.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Works fine for me with Simplified Chinese. Make sure you don't have two sets of quotes where you define the name. Maybe something like:!define NAME `&quot;name with spaces&quot;`<br />
LangString Name ${LANG_ENGLISH} ${NAME}<br />
LangString Name ${LANG_SIMPCHINESE} '${NAME}'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked for the double-quote and didn't find anything obvious (to me).  What I have are header files with each languages strings (saved as the appropriate plain text encoding).<br />
<br />
Simplified Chinese header:<br />
<br />
LangString localizedProductName ${LANG_SIMPCHINESE} &quot;Our Product&quot;<br />
....<br />
<br />
<br />
Installer:<br />
<br />
...<br />
Name &quot;$(localizedProductName)&quot;<br />
...<br />
<br />
So, I'm not sure why this is happening...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Create a minimal script reproducing the problem and attach it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been able to reproduce.  Here are my results, they are similar to my actual installer.  Attached are the two script files.  The SimpChinese header is in GB2312 encoding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't see any quotes when running that. But I don't have a Chinese font, so it might be a special quote in the Chinese quote. Can you attach a screenshot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a screenshot of the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Those are indeed special quotes and not the standard 0x22 quotes. They are located in the MUI language file. If you open the translation with a hex editor, you can see \xa1\xb0 before $(^NameDA) and \xa1\xb1 after it. The values differ by one, which suggests the meaning is similar. That fits with those being quotes, one turning left and the other right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">So, is there problem with the quotes that I am using?  Or is this a problem with the MUI quotes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no problem with your script. The quotes are located in the MUI language file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goldy, I suggest contacting the translator and/or verifier to correct this. If you are in a bind and need this immediately, I can send you a fixed copy.<br />
<br />
Kichik, I checked the traditional chinese file, and it doesn't have this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for all the help.  I e-mailed the translator and the revisor about the issue.  Hopefully it will be resolved shortly.<br />

It's not urgent, but thanks for the offer.</div></div><hr />
