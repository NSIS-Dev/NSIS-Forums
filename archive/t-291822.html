Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used the Wizard in Eclipse NSIS to make a script using Modern UI.  There are two automatically generated sections of interest, one is called &quot;post&quot;, the other &quot;un.post&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;post&quot; gets called from somewhere (I don't know where, I'm assuming a macro somwhere in the MUI include file) at the end of the installation, but &quot;un.post&quot; does not get called at the end of the uninstallation.  I'm wondering if there is something I have to do with a MUI macro to get this called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th May 2008, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not macro related. All selected sections are automatically executed in the instfiles page. See the tutorial (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter2.html#2.3) in the documentation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, after I did some more diggin, it turns out that the section was getting called, just that none of the functions in it were working.</div></div><hr />
