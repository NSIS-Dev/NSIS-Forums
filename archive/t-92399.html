<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emr</div><div class="date">26th June 2002, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I am fighting with a quoting problem in the 198 version when the created installer is run on NT4 systems. This problem was also present in older versions.<br />
<br />
From my nsi file:<br />
<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\install.bat&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR&quot; &quot;$8&quot; &quot;$9&quot;'<br />
<br />
The quotes are provided to deal with spaces in $INSTDIR. This works fine on W2K and XP, but the command is not executed and the error flag is set under NT4.<br />
<br />
Is this a known bug? Is there any way to get a more detailed error message other than using the error flag? I'd like to find out what exactly fails here (other than &quot;an error has happened&quot; :-).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emr</div><div class="date">26th June 2002, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Further investigation shows that the second quote pair causes the problem.<br />
<br />
Specifying<br />
<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\install.bat&quot; $INSTDIR'<br />
<br />
executes correctly but fails if $INSTDIR contains spaces.<br />
<br />
Has anyone a solution to this problem?</div></div><hr />

Compile both and run executor.exe. It works for me very fine (Win2K). Maybe there is something else going on in your script. Please check it.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emr</div><div class="date">26th June 2002, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I'll try that.<br />
<br />
But that will take time, as I'll go on holidays until mid July from tomorrow.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I did an ugly workaround by prohibiting filenames with spaces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">26th June 2002, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the test script, I think everything works fine. So it should be possible to have dirnames with spaces.<br />
<br />
Have a nice holiday, good luck,<br />
