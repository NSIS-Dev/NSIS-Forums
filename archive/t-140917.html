<br />
I've noticed that the *.nlf files in the &quot;{NSIS}\Contrib\Language files&quot; folder have various NLF version numbers (NLF v2, NLF v3, NLF v4, and NLF v5). It seems the older versions have some strings missing. Is it &quot;safe&quot; to build an installer using languages which happen to have differing NLF version numbers, or is it best to ensure that all of the files used have the same version number (eg only use files which have &quot;NLF v5&quot; at the start)?<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining that some files are out of date, I am just wondering if it is safe to use different versions of these files in my installer.<br />

I don't seem to find any reason for the LicenseForceSelection strings to behave this way so I have made them use English too. It is safe to use them, but some English strings may appear if the user chooses that language.<br />
<br />
All NLFs that have older headers and missing strings are NLFs that the authors have not updated.</div></div><hr />

I should have realised that NSIS would be clever enough to cope with out of date NLF files!<br />
<br />
When I started to add other languages to my installer, I was amazed at the wide range available for NSIS - now I know I can use as many as I want and the worst that can happen is that some messages will be in English.<br />
