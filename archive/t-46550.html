First, here's the Equilazer that I want to convert into plug in for Winamp (http://www.yamaha.com/menuitems/panelviews/proaudio/GQ2015A/GQ2015A.htm) Isn't nice??:D<br />
<br />
That would be my first attempt in Winamp developper. I didn't made Skins or plug ins. I have VB4 pro edtion and I try to get VB5 pro edition. But can I do something with my VB4? WHICH PROGRAMS DO I REALLY NEED TO CREATE MY BEAUTY????<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />

Probably the easiest language to program an equalizer plugin for Winamp would be C++.  If you've never coded before...  good luck.<br />
<br />
Another place that might be worth looking at woudl be the Nullsoft Developers Network:<br />
http://www.winamp.com/nsdn<br />
They might have something there that will help you on your way.<br />
Good luck!<br />
