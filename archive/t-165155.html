<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">autofuzz</div><div class="date">16th January 2004, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I 'ported' my 1.x installer to 2b4 and now to 2RC2 and am seeing a very wired phenomenon.<br />
I have a bunch of SQL files i have inserted into the installer to create a database at runtime, these files are put in using <br />
!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_EXTRACT &quot;file.sql&quot;<br />
<br />
and Reserved using<br />
ReserveFile &quot;file.sql&quot;<br />
<br />
and at runtime I read them from the plugins directory.<br />
<br />
during runtime i find the sql's fail to execute, if i look through the temp dirs to see the file extracted live from the installer I see that the last 2 lines have this text inserted in them.<br />
[Settings]<br />
RTL=0<br />
<br />
I'm seeing that out of all the text files i have in the installer (inserted in the same way), a few sql's, a few vbs's  and also a bunch of ini's (for custom dialogs), only the ini's don't get this string in them, all other 'non installer specific files' seem to have those two lines.<br />
<br />
what am I doing wrong? is there a bug?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
A</div></div><hr />

I was beginning to think I'd imagined it.<br />
<br />
As far as I remember the same two lines were added to the end of the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to put something else in the plug-ins folder use InitPluginsDir and File with $PLUGINSDIR.</div></div><hr />
