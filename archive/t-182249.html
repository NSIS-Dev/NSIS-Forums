<br />
I experienced something, and hope maybe it can be solved. In my install script I map a drive to another server (this causes no problem) and then I try to extract a file to this drive and it doesn't work. However if the map to the drive was already created before running the installer I can extract the file. How could I avoid this? thanxs.<br />
<br />
cheers,<br />

Can you test situation with new drive - run &quot;dir&quot;, for example. Or do this job in two steps (2 execs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">5th June 2004, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Or add Sleep 3 sec between drive mapping file copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">almoes</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried with sleep 5 and no chance. The steps are done in two exes. Takhir, what are y&lt;ou suggesting with 'dir'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try to understand, was drive mapped after first exec or not. Run any Windows utility, working with file server - dir f:\ (new drive letter from &quot;net&quot; parameters) or fc, &quot;more f:\file&quot; :) and check up this way valid drive letter (f:\ for example)<br />
BTW, most of Win programs work fine directly with network path (I had one problem long ago, but I cannot remember what it was .. ) <br />
<br />
E:\Documents and Settings\takhir&gt;copy \\bar\takhir\install.sh .<br />
   1  file(s) copied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">almoes</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I made alot of tests and the drive is mapped. The network path doesn't work because I need to specify another username and password, unless there's a way to specify it apart from mapping a drive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">almoes</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">It works now. I placed the map drive command just after the user input and the extracting of files is after. I just hope it works all times.</div></div><hr />
