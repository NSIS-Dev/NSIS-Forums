<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">janedoe2003</div><div class="date">4th January 2004, 00:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I got my feet wet yesterday, and successfully (I hope :-))built two scripts, one to install the dependencies for a VB5 app, and the other to download a file from the Net.<br />
<br />
I read a bunch of messages on this site... but don't think I saw someone mentionning that they had written a generic, ie. application independent through-the-web installer.<br />
<br />
Here's what I was thinking of doing:<br />
<br />
1. Show list of apps in combo box (eg. &quot;App1&quot;, &quot;App2&quot;, etc.), so the user can select which app he wants to install<br />
<br />
2. Connect to the Net<br />
<br />
3. Get list of deps for said app (list.php?app=App2) -&gt; $TEMP\App2.ini<br />
<br />
4. For each dep, check if installed and correct version<br />
<br />
5. Download, install, registry if necessary<br />
<br />
The goal is to make this installer app-independent, and very light so as not to pack/download any file that is already installed on the user's PC (some of our customers are still connected at 56Kbps).<br />
<br />
Any idea if this can be done in NSIS? For instance, UpgradeDL requires that both files to be compared are installed on the host, which we'd like to avoid.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
JD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to use the UpgradeDLL macro, you will have to create a custom version that takes a version as parameter and downloads a file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks :-)<br />
<br />
OK, I read the whole CHM file... which has very few examples. Before I dive into the \Examples section, any code that someone already has to perform the following would be most appreciated. I assume I'm not the first person to want to write a basic installer that fetches files from the Net, so as to avoid forcing users to download big installers with lots of standards files they already have (VB runtime, etc.).<br />
<br />
Step 1: Display a combo box with a list of apps, eg &quot;App1&quot;, &quot;App2&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Call a PHP script on a web server, with the app name as parameter (www.acme.com/list.php?app=app2), and get list of files require to install this app<br />
<br />
Step 3: Either parse the list returned in a HTTP connection (eg. CSV-formatted), or save list as INI file somwhere, and extract dependencies using the ad hoc functions<br />
<br />
Step 4: Fill an array for those requirements, and iterate through the array, checking whether each file is already installed and in the correct version; Otherwise, download and install<br />
<br />
Thank you for _any_ code you might have<br />
JD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not difficult at all. The easiest method is to use INI files on the server. You can create a modified macro that takes the version on the server as parameter and downloads the file.</div></div><hr />

because I am really interesting in that !!</div></div><hr />
