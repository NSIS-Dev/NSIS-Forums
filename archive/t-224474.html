  I'm working on a complicated install file that can be updated without the need to being re-compiled. A part of it checks some server permissions, uploads and chmods files with FTP.<br />
  I was looking a cURL, but it doesn't appear to let you run commands such as 'LIST'. I need to be able to check if a server has a cgi-bin, if a test script executes correctly, etc.<br />
  Is there another GPL small command line ftp client I could use for this project?<br />
<br />
Also I'm struggling for time with this one. Can some of you be commissioned for projects? If so what sort of costs would I be looking at?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Lyle</div></div><hr />

can give you all ftp functionality. The only problem is black DOS window during communication. If you need a special program for this - I sent PM</div></div><hr />

Whether you'd need to use nsExec::ExecToLog/ExecToStack or whether nsExec::Exec is enough, I can't say, though, as I haven't actually used it yet - but the readme suggests that ::Exec will do the trick.</div></div><hr />
