<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">20th November 2013, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">for nsis it means nothing, just for the forums. would be lovely if we'd get access to all the posts, but i doubt that will happen. nsis has been open sourced for the longest time and the project (and wiki) is currently on sourceforge.<br />
<br />
i'm currently on and off working on a new website for nsis and my suggestion would be to integrate a forum. waiting for kichik to show up on chat to discuss this with him.</div></div><hr />

Winamp.com and associated web services will no longer be available past December 20, 2013. Additionally, Winamp Media players will no longer be available for download. Please download the latest version before that date. See release notes (http://www.winamp.com/help/Version_History#Winamp_5.66) for latest improvements to this last release.<br />
Thanks for supporting the Winamp community for over 15 years.<br />
What effect will the closing of Winamp and  have on NSIS?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
i just saw this message http://www.winamp.com/media-player/en.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
http://www.winamp.com/media-player/en<br />
<br />
What effect will the closing of Winamp and  have on NSIS?d<br />
<br />
why should it have any effect on nsis? afaik the only actual link to nullsoft/aol is that justin frankel was behind nsis 1.x, ever since 2.x came out it's been in the hand of the community and hosted on sourceforge.<br />
<br />
i've been wondering about the legal situation before, e.g. whether nsis is legally entitled to use the name &quot;nullsoft&quot;. maybe this shutdown is a good occasion to cut all ties and give a new meaning to n in nsis.<br />
<br />
<br />
What will this mean for NSIS and the forum?<br />
<br />
<br />
according to that notice, the forum will be shut down. imho that's shame regarding all the knowledge stored here. personally i don't find it important to carry on in the shape of a forum. i wouldn't mind using github (there are thoughts moving nsis to github) or sourceforge. there's also a lot of activity going on at stack overflow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">For the project itself it means nothing since everything else is hosted on sourceforge.<br />
<br />
We will move to a different forum, we just have to decide where to go. And as Yathosho says, you can also ask on stackoverflow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We will move to a different forum, we just have to decide where to go<br />
<br />
i'd just stay away from forum hosters to prevent another lock-in or try to find one where that won't happen. is it possible to install one via sourceforge websites (like the wiki)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">My two cents worth: The NSIS forums have always offered an extremely low-threshold gateway to the community. Apart from the enormous amount of knowledge available here, which in my opinion is worth some effort to try and preserve, I believe it would be of great benefit to keep something as open as these forums available for (future) users.<br />
<br />
While saying that, I do realize that the amount of work required isn't going to get done by itself, and I don't have the luxury of being able to offer hours to help. So I just hope some other people will be willing to jump in.<br />
<br />
Practical question: Did anyone approach the Winamp webmasters for a copy of the NSIS forums database?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T.Slappy</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Msg - what about simply copying NSIS forum database and starting it on other server?<br />
I want to help with this, can anybody find out what is required for such action?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">It is unknown at this point if we can get a dump of this subforum but from what I heard we should not get our hopes up.<br />
<br />
Somebody could of course use wget in spider mode on f-65.html and host it somewhere so it can be indexed by google ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">too bad the archive view doesn't denote code-blocks, otherwise it would've been easy to add a syntax highlighter to the scraped pages</div></div><hr />
