<br />
Which library or macro that deletes only installed files when the uninstallation is run would you recommend?<br />
<br />
I'm aware this kind question has been asked alot but I'm looking for advice on the most current and easiest to use macro/library. As in the past,I used old macros that were posted on http://nsis.sourceforge.net for things like Command Line Argument parsing and had problems with the code and implementation.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that there are 2 so far(are there more?):<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Advanced_Uninstall_Log_NSIS_Header<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Uninstall_only_installed_files<br />
<br />
Which library or single macro do you use and recommend?<br />
<br />
I am hoping that I am able to install files by only specifying a folder X(and all its sub files will be installed) and the uninstaller will then delete all the subfiles in folder X but leave any the user created.<br />
<br />
For eg:<br />
<br />
    Section &quot;install&quot;<br />
       File \r &quot;FolderX&quot; <br />
       <br />
       # note how I dont do this..<br />
       File \r &quot;FolderX\filea.txt&quot; <br />
       File \r &quot;FolderX\fileb.txt&quot;<br />
    SectionEnd<br />
<br />
    Section &quot;un.uninstall&quot;<br />
       ${RemoveDir} &quot;FolderX&quot; <br />
       <br />
       # The above hypothetical function will hopefully only delete the files in FolderX that I installed.<br />
       Delete \r &quot;FolderX\filea.txt&quot; <br />
       Delete \r &quot;FolderX\fileb.txt&quot;<br />
    SectionEnd</div></div><hr />
