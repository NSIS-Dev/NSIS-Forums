<br />
I'm trying to use the NOTIFY flag with 3 radioButtons and I'm having troubles: the 'leave' function is called 18 TIMES :eek: !!! <br />
<br />
I've tried to play around with the example provided (NSIS\Contrib\InstallOptions\testnotify.nsi) , and it did work perfectly. I met the problem as soon as I've tried this flag with radiobuttons... (but according to the doc it should work !)<br />
<br />
In the following thread Deguix has had a 'similar' problem, but Eccles apparently fixed it.. <br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=164006<br />
<br />
Is there something wrong with my script ? Or could it be a *new* bug ? :confused:<br />
<br />
I have WinXP and tried using NSIS 2.0 final release and also using today's devsnapshot..<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help :)<br />

So, to see what is that, attach the script, please...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So your example is using radiobuttons as well ? I guess it's something wrong with my script then... :(<br />
But as I had errors I used example1.nsi and I just added the code related to this flag, and I can't see what the hell is wrong with it... <br />
<br />
Here it is, with the 'ini' file..<br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />

I tried this in my computer and it worked normally. Try to uninstall the current version of NSIS you have, get the official version 2.0 and use its updater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilO</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I did ... :(<br />
<br />
Well yesterday in the first place I downloaded the development snapshot, installed it in another directory, and specified the new compiler to use. Didn't work.<br />
<br />
And today I tried your suggestion, uninstalled NSIS, installed it again, and tried the NSIS updater without success. First I tried using &quot;Download the latest development files and merge your changes&quot; and afterwards using &quot;Download a clean copy of the latest development files&quot;.<br />
Both didn't work. <br />
<br />
At this point I'm lost, I just don't know what the problem is. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">But you tried the update thing with NSIS 2.0 or its development snapshot? NSIS 2.0 updater is certain that works. But you don't have really to update the official NSIS 2.0 to fix that bug as it already contains the bug fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilO</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I wasn't precise enough. I (re)installed the official NSIS 2.0, *not* the devsnapshot. And then I updated using the NSIS menu. And then it didn't work...<br />

<br />
I've tested the compiled example you sent me on :<br />
- Windows XP Professionnal Service Pack 1<br />
- Windows 2000 Service Pack 4<br />
- Windows NT Service Pack 6<br />
<br />
No success at all :cry:. Which OS have you got ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot <br />
<br />

<br />
PS: <br />
BTW could someone else test this example? I'd like to know if I'm the only one to have the problem.. (which could mean that my brain isn't working properly :D)<br />
<br />
The test is easy, there are 3 radiobuttons, select the 2nd or 3rd one, and then the 1st one (named &quot;release&quot;). The 'Leave' function should be called once. On my computer it is called exactly 18 times !!! <br />
<br />
Thanks :) !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to know, I have Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1 with all updates available at this moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Tested here on two separate copies of Windows 2000 Professional SP4 with all updates.<br />
<br />
Works fine for me (TM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, just done some more tests. Using the mouse everything is fine, but using the keyboard I too get repeated message boxes with the above example. :igor: <br />
<br />
Another thing on my list to look at when I get a chance...  sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilO</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh! How the hell did I miss that !?? I tested this example many times, on several systems, I guess I'm just too used to the keyboard :p<br />
<br />
Deguix and Eccles, thanks a lot for your tests and replies, really :up:. I was going nuts as I couldn't determine the origin of the problem, and as I thought I was the only one to have it (kind of selfish, isn't it ? ;)).<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot to both of you, it really helped :) <br />
