Is there a way to get the Date Created of the file on the server instead ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">6th October 2004, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You shouldn't compare file creation dates for updates. The reason for this is that the file creation date will be completely different after it is decompressed (its file creation date would be the time and date that it was decompressed!)<br />
<br />
Therefore you should check for updates using MD5 values. Check out this plugin (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=488) that creates file MD5's.<br />
<br />
To do updates you will have to store the MD5 of your file in a file on the internet, and user's installers will download it and compare the MD5 in the downloaded file to their local file.<br />
<br />
To make an MD5 for your update files, you should write a small NSIS installer to do it (using the plugin).<br />

<br />
sounds like a good plan<br />
because the file is a bit large to download and compare every time [for modem users], would I make an MD5 file out of an .ini or preference file<br />
containing file versions and such...This is how most people do this yes ?</div></div><hr />
