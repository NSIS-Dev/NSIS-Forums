<br />
I came across this problem after a corrupted install of something.<br />
<br />
now everytime i try to install something that uses nsis<br />
it gives me the following error popups and it won't install:<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
NSIS ERROR<br />
Error writing temp file<br />
<br />
(next popup)<br />
<br />
NSIS ERROR<br />
Installer verification failed.<br />
<br />
This could be the result of an incomplete download,<br />
a failing disk, or (possibly) corruption from a virus.<br />
<br />
You can try to force an install using the /NCRC<br />
command line switch (but it is NOT recommended)<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
the likelihood of it being a failing disk/virus is next<br />
to nil, i've run numerous diagnostics and scan.<br />
<br />
is there some kind of registry key i can fiddle with to fix<br />
this? <br />
 <br />
any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
(side note: ironically, it wasnt until this problem cropped up <br />
that i started noticing how widely nsis is being used)</div></div><hr />

It's the product of one of these:<br />
1. Incomplete download.<br />
2. Virus.<br />
3. Corrupted.<br />
5. Increase data after Compilation.<br />
And no, there isn't a reg. key for this. :(<br />
<br />
What product are try to install?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sp4mm4gn3t</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">i was trying to install a game i downloaded when the error came up, but i'm pretty sure thats not causing the problem, it's something i was trying to install earlier (something off the winamp site, though i don't know whether it was a plugin or skin). where is this temp/persistent(?) data being stored that it interferes with subsequent attempts to install things? isn't there a file i can just delete or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever your system temp directory is set to, normally c:\temp. However I think Lobo Lunar was trying to say that this is not your problem, that in fact you do have a corrupted download or other problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS installers do not save anything on your computer for later use by default, if the setup writer chooses to do so it's another story but nothing he can do can cause the error you are having. The only possibilities are what Lobo Lunar said. You either have connection problems, a failing disk, a virus or the file is damaged on the server.<br />
<br />
I have attached an example installer for you to test. If it fails too reattach it here and I will check it to see what's wrong with it.<br />
<br />
The file sp4mm4gn3t is about to attach might contain a virus! Do NOT download this file!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't it safer to send the file trough e-mail personally?<br />
<br />
And, people (including me) think that Do NOT download this file! means the file you've just attached. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">E-mail filters too much and if he attaches it here other people that know exactly what they're doing can test it too. People who know how to read see that the second sentence that says &quot;do not...&quot; refers to the first one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sp4mm4gn3t</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">strangely enough that one seemed to work fine.<br />
it's just supposed to install makensisw.exe to program files/example1<br />
right?<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you attempted to re-download the installer again (the one that won't run)<br />
<br />
-Stu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sp4mm4gn3t</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">OK. I sorted it out. I'm officially a moron.<br />
For some reason I no longer recall, I had set a user environment var for TEMP which overrode the *system* TEMP environment var.<br />
Thanks for the help people. Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Kichik: does this mean that a possible non-working installer may be caused by an overridden TEMP environment variable?<br />
Then should I add this to the archive's Known NSIS Issues-folder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th April 2003, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah... It couldn't create the compress whole temporary file. I'll a test that will make it try again with another name, the user's games with the temporary directory shouldn't affect it so badly.<br />
<br />
Virtlink, yes, if the temporary directory that Windows returns is invalid and the installer uses compress whole this will always happen (until I add another check), add it.</div></div><hr />
