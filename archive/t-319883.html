<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">11th June 2010, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using MUI2 and have a problem with controls being drawn when the custom page appears, but 5 seconds later the control (text, radio button, etc) disappears. If I move another window in front of the dialog and then move it away, the text will reappear. I'm running on Windows XP, compiling with NSIS 2.46.<br />
<br />
I know that this was a symptom when the controls overlap with another control, but I'm sure that I don't have any overlapping controls on the page in the screen shot here. This page has only two controls on it and was created with code like this:nsDialogs::Create 1018<br />
Pop $0<br />
${NSD_CreateLabel}  0u 0u 100% 11u &quot;The following messages show failed components or indicate actions are required.&quot;<br />
Pop $0<br />
${NSD_CreateListBox}  0u 20u 100% 67% &quot;&quot;<br />
Pop $ErrorsPage.hLBox<br />
... # code to fill the list box<br />
# Display the page.<br />
nsDialogs::Show<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me figure out why these controls are disappearing?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">12th June 2010, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's obviously something running in my system that's causing it. I cut/pasted Anders' code and it exhibits the same behavior. I'll track it down and figure out which program is doing it.<br />
<br />
I just was concerned that my setup programs might do that on our customers' systems; now it appears unlikely.<br />
<br />
Thanks for checking your systems, Anders and Animaether. When I find what causes it I'll post a followup.<br />

edit: attach screen shot from Anders' script</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">12th June 2010, 02:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I tracked down the offending program; it was ipoint.exe (version 6.1). Microsoft had a newer version for my mouse (7.1) and the problem is gone now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">12th June 2010, 03:06</div></div><div class="posttext">glad you found the culprit.. wonder what part of that driver messes with UI drawing.  ah well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">15th June 2010, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, this might be the cause of the problems we have seen with NSIS at our end. I am going to grab this driver and roll back our nsDialog changes and see if this problem goes away. A lot of us have MS mice and the IntelliPoint 6.x drivers. I will try the 7.0 driver and get back to you when I can.</div></div><hr />
