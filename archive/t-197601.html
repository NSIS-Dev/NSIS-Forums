(The same NSIS script is working fine in windows 98). This is happending only with one particular directory.<br />
In my script at so may places I am using this &quot;RMDir /r&quot; everything is succeded except one.<br />
<br />
Using &quot;IfErrors&quot; I came to know that some error occured when trying to delete the directory.<br />
<br />
How to find the error code?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Open up the folder after it fails to delete and you'll see which file it is. If it contains no files, then the directory itself could not have been deleted, probably because it is the current working directory of some application. You can make sure it's not your installer's current working directory by calling SetOutPath with another directory.</div></div><hr />
