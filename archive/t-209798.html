<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">8th March 2005, 02:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I am comfortable with the default MUI size. I would like to increase the size of the installer to just under 640 by 480 as an experiment.<br />
<br />
I found some threads on the subject but none made clear enough, the steps involved in insuring every object remains proportionate and relative to the size increase.<br />
<br />
I've used the following:<br />
<br />
!define MUI_UI &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\UIs\MUI640x480.exe&quot; ;640x480 interface<br />
<br />
I made a copy of modern.exe and renamed it to MUI640x480. I then used Resource Hacker to randomly change sizes to all windows found within modern.exe<br />
<br />
This obviously didn't produce many great results or not at least what I expected. So, I opened up all *.exe files located in UIs. I then modified them all and started seeing results.<br />
<br />
I guess my question is, how do I know what screen is which because some screens across some of the .exe's look almost identical.<br />
<br />
I believe I can learn this with plenty of experimentation but thought I ask incase someone has taken their time out to  write an article or tutorial or really just about anything good on the subject.<br />
<br />
I guess I am looking for tips, hints and tricks as I know I am on the right path. I just want to make it right without finding out down the road, I missed this or that, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any comments or suggestions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">8th March 2005, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically I learnt at first by moving everything freehand, but it's always messy that way. If you look at the UI script, controls have either height,width or x,y,width,height<br />
Therefore, if you plan on making everything larger you should work on those numbers in the script.<br />
<br />
105 is the background UI with the Back and Next buttons on, so you should make that bigger first. Then resize the big rectangle on that (which is what all other installer pages sit on.)<br />
<br />
For example, if you make your 105 resource 640 wide, then you should make all other pages 640 wide as well (first width,height at top of script).<br />
