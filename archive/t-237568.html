<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender7584</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright,<br />
<br />
So I made a nice skin with skincrafter, and it works great, except for one problem.<br />
<br />
On the MUI welcome page (MUI_PAGE_WELCOME) the header image (MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP) and header bar show up when they're not supposed to.<br />
<br />
This makes the installer pretty ugly.  Any idea of a workaround?  Ive tried just not putting the header image tag, but the bar is still there, just a nice big blank bar.<br />
<br />
I'd be happy if I could figure out how to put text in it, or have the regular text that's in all my other pages (like the MUI_PAGE_HEADER_TEXT and MUI_PAGE_HEADER_SUBTEXT)  Because then it wouldn't just be a big bar.<br />
<br />
I've included a photoshopped picture of the installer frames and labels.<br />

<br />
Any help would be appreciated! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender7584</div><div class="date">10th February 2006, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, if anyone curious and having the same problem, I found a few workarounds.<br />
<br />
To solve the banner problem, use the nostretch tag in the MUI documentation, and then just create an image that takes up the entire top banner, and has text already there.  Then the text will always be there, and not flash or mess up.<br />
<br />
To solve the weird button problems, use the enablewindow command to flash them disabled, then enabled again.  Do this in the MUI show function before the welcome page, and before the finish page.  That will keep your buttons looking decent.<br />
<br />
For the branding text, just set it as a space ( &quot; &quot; ) so that it will not show up under the image.<br />
<br />
These workarounds make it much more bearable.</div></div><hr />
