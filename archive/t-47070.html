<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">numberone</div><div class="date">13th April 2001, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I have compiled an installation that uses the DLLRegisterServer function, and it works fine with Windows 2000 SP1 machines (Mfc42.dll 6.0.8665.0), but when a client runs it on an NT 4.0 SP4 machine (Mfc42.dll 4.2.xxxx) they receive the following error when the install program tries to register a DLL:<br />
<br />
Olemainthreadwndname:<br />
Ordinal 6663 could not be located in the DLL Mfc42.dll<br />
<br />
Is this because the Mfc42.dll is too old on the client's machine?  I did not think this installer had a reference to the MFC, but mabye I'm wrong.  Can anybody help?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">numberone</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember correctly, the problem was an out of date Mfc42.dll.  I was able to rename the old version, then copy the newer version from a Win2k box, then reboot the NT4 machine, and then it worked (I think).  That was a while ago so I can't remember exactly how I resolved the issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">No I don't use RegDLL anywhere in my script.  At least not to my knowledge.  Could be it's hidden away in a macro or something but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">So which command are you using to call DLLRegisterServer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Correction, I used to call RegDLL to register a DLL but I no longer use that.  I now only have a call to UnRegDLL to get rid of the DLL I was formerly registering. Could that cause the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">When installing an MFC application you should make sure the computer you're installing to has the right MFC version. IIRC Microsoft provide pre-built installers for MFC, so you can get one from MSDN and install it if the MFC dll version doesn't match your plug-in expectations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok thanks Kichik, I'll do that.</div></div><hr />
