<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aviadlich</div><div class="date">14th May 2008, 09:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a strange error during installation:<br />
While trying to extract file using the following command:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $INSTDIR\bin<br />
  File bin\*.pack<br />
  File bin\*.exe<br />
  File bin\*.bat<br />
  File bin\*.dll<br />
<br />
i have 2 dll files that should be extracted <br />
but one of the files is not extracted<br />
in the log i have the following line:<br />
Extract: msvcr71.dll... 100% <br />
<br />
So actually there is no indication that the file was not extracted.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to see at runtime that there is a failure?<br />
Why did can this happen?</div></div><hr />
