<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Team929</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran into NSIS the other day, and I mean that literally. I started messing around with it and found that this would do all the work that I need it to do (and more) for work purposes. I have figured out pretty much everything that I need to do till this point (I know there is A LOT more to this but for now i'm trying to stay with what I actually need). <br />
<br />
Except I'm lost as to how to add a timer when installing. To be more specific, something to the effect of &quot;Time Remaining: 23minutes 23 seconds&quot; next to the progression bar. I know this might be a trivial question to the experts on the forum and as I've said I'm a TOTAL newb... who somehow figured out how to get the installer working enuff to convince my boss not to buy installsh@!*d.. In other words, I need to get this thing working :cry: any and all comments are welcome and very appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Estimating the remaining time is very difficult. Every operation takes a different amount of time on every system.<br />
<br />
Have a look at at the time estimations of Windows and other installers. They are always incorrect.<br />
<br />
It's imho better to give no esimited time than to give a wrong time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best you can do is set the text of some custom label with SendMessage ${WM_SETTEXT}. To create such a label you will have to use a customized UI, use the latest version of NSIS from the CVS for this.</div></div><hr />
