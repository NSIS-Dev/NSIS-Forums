<br />
but didn't quite understand it.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to do the following.<br />
<br />
The installer is set up for several clients. Most of the files are in a general directory. A few, if they are necessary are in a client specific directory. Some clients may need these specific files, others not. A !define tells the compiler which client the installer is being written for.<br />
<br />
What I would like to do is, at compile time, if a file exists in a client specific directory, use it, otherwise get the file from a general directory.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

As has been said before, you have to create an application that writes a header file depending on the status of your files.</div></div><hr />
