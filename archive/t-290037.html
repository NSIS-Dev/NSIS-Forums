<br />
Sorry for what is probably a simple question but I'm new to doing this so...<br />
<br />
I want to know<br />
<br />
1. Does NSIS decompress the install package to a temporary file whilst it is installing.<br />
<br />
2. How can I verify that the files copied to the Hard Disk by the installer are the same as the files in the install package.<br />
<br />
Does the action of the installer verify that what was installed is actually what was incorporated in the install package. (After an initial install, I'll essentially be overwriting the same files with updates, I want to therefore verify that the overwritten file has been sucessfully overwritten with the correct file contents).<br />
<br />
What I do at the moment is use a batch file to do the copy and then use the MSDOS comp command to verify that the files on the CD are the same as the files in the target directories.<br />
<br />
Would I still have to invoke a 'dos compare' for the files or does NSIS handle this in some way (hence question 1, i.e the temporary directory would be the source for the compare against the installed target).<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
