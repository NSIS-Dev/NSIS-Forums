<br />
First, I am not a professional programmer and this is my first posting, so please forgive me if I ask something simple or I have clicked the wrong options for the posting.<br />
<br />
I'm using NSIS 2.18 at the moment - I see that there is a 2.19 version, but the changes in 2.19 don't appear (as far as I can tell) to relate to my issue...<br />
<br />
I have created an installer which uses the InstallLib macros to install some .DLL and .EXE files (so that I can use the various REG and SHARED options - thanks).  I need it to update some existing files, some of which have file version numbers and some of which do not but all of which might be locked open so need to be updated on a Windows restart.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen (and this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=235903) appears to confirm it) InstallLib only looks at the file version number when deciding whether or not a file needs to be copied.  Have I understood correctly?<br />
<br />
I see in the tread noted above (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=235903) that kichik wrote &quot;You can use SetOverwrite ifnewer&quot; - does that mean that InstallLib should obey the &quot;SetOverwrite ifnewer&quot; instruction if neither the existing nor potential fils have version numbers, or that when there is no version number I should revert to the use of the basic &quot;File&quot; instruction in which case I guess I loose all the nice functions provided by the InstallLib macros.<br />
<br />
Also in the tread noted above (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=235903) kichik suggested that changes to the InstallLib macro might be required and that if a patch was produced he'd consdier including it - patching the macro file is a bit beyond me, did anyone manage to implement the extension?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

To use SetOverwrite ifnewer, you need to revert to File. The Library macros ignore SetOverwrite.</div></div><hr />
