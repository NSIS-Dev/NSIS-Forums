<br />
of course i'll join you and help there if you create one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dennis Alexande</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 21:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your Help.<br />
<br />
The point is, that maybe some player got serious Problems using this here, cause they cant speal (or read/write) english as good as other Members here. Thats the point. I created a sub-Forum, you are welcome to register ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dennis Alexande</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I had set up this Sub-Forum for NSIS-Support in German now. I already set up one Tutorial in German Language on the main Website of NSIS.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can edit the Page 8http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Community) and enter the Link to the German Support. Thanks</div></div><hr />

I do speak and read German very well, I'll would not consider looking on a german only forum, due to the fact statisticly the forum has less information.<br />
<br />
I think it is great you want to be of help for NSIS but a separate forum... well it's up to you but I thing better invest some of your time in learning English, this is always benificial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dennis Alexande</div><div class="date">6th January 2006, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">its up to you. If you dont want to register and talk in german, than i think you are welcome in this board here.<br />
<br />
I only saw that there are some other Communyties. (Spanish and anotherone) but they are offline.<br />
<br />
So i thought it would be great to create a german one. Ok. Its not the &quot;real&quot; main forum, but i think there is enough space to talk about nsis. (this forum only have one sub forum, too)<br />
<br />
I also searched for developers who are able to recode my forum, so i am able to store syntax highlighted code in a dbase. <br />
<br />
If you want come and talk, if you want to discuss on english, do it here.<br />

<br />
(if you mean you cant see a sub forum for the supports, its up that i placed it into &quot;Projekte&quot; in a category which is visible for registered users only. I will edit that as far as the new hack is installed. (changing category stuff atm)</div></div><hr />
