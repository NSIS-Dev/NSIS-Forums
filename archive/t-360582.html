<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ctc1989</div><div class="date">3rd May 2013, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">For my installer, I want to be able to check to make sure none of the programs from my install suite are still running when the installer starts up.  I was going to use the Processes plug in, but one of the programs that can be open is a CHM (Compiled HTML Help), which does not show up in processes (.chm, not .exe).  Would it be possible to loop through open windows, and grab the actual title?  They never change, so I'd be able to do a loop and some easy strcmp's.  I'm thinking it would be a System::Call of some sort, and am currently looking into it.  If anyone knows of the top of their head, I'd appreciate the help.  Thanks! :up:</div></div><hr />
