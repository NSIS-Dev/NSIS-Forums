You will need to consult your lawyers. If the answer is something we can later use in case someone else needs that number, it'd be great if you can share it.</div></div><hr />

Actually NSIS can ask this issue to B.I.S. to get their official certification I think, they will assign category number appropriately, and you can share the info since...<br />
<br />
I asked this issue to several related departments and sites such as(Yes I'm in Japan), and all people told me that software developer can ask it to B.I.S. and get an official number from them. <br />
<br />
1. Bureau of Industry and Security(http://www.bis.doc.gov/)<br />
Keywords: The Export Administration Regulation/Commerce Control List/<br />
2. JETRO (Japanese External Trade Organization)<br />
3. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan<br />
4. &quot;InstallShiled&quot; web site(Japanese),<br />
I couldn't find any documnets in U.S. site but I can find ECCN number for &quot;IntallShield&quot; as &quot;5D992/No License Required&quot; in the page:http://www.networld.co.jp/products/is/x5/exportcode_200412.pdf<br />
<br />
I want to try to get the number but I cannot I think, what do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th October 2008, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if you can. That's why I suggest you contact your lawyers. If you can, great. If you can't, you'll to do without one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">9th October 2008, 23:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that, quite technically, -you- would need to get certification anyway; the binary installer result is not just NSIS, but also your script code, any plugins you may use, etc., any of which may touch on subjects of the export restrictions, especially if you export to certain countries.<br />
<br />
Talk to your lawyers / legal department - we're not either of those ;)<br />
<br />
Somewhat off-topic... there are very, very few companies that deliver software that deal with this; it's usually by request of an end-user to make sure -they- are in the clear more than you, yourself.  Especially if your software gets published online - even if it does high levels of encryption and should be forbidden for export to, say, Iran... you can't really prevent it.. you can set up your site to ban 'iranian' IPs and some proxies, but then some other proxy opens up and they can get it anyway.<br />
Again, though, talk with your legal counsel.</div></div><hr />
