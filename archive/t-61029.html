<br />
if i put a scripting engine into slate blue that would allow the user to create their own functions and add them to the program at startup and at runtime.<br />
<br />
could be useful.<br />
<br />
let me know,</div></div><hr />

There is some type of problem. If the program doesn't understand what the user is wanting. I don't know exactly what you mean, but it still sound cool.<br />
<br />
Is the DLL expandability still gonna be add??? I plan on having my own language, but I would like SB to have some type of knowledge about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">28th September 2001, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">here's my plan:<br />
<br />
after the full nsis coding is done, add the following features:<br />
<br />
1) - a slate blue scripting language.<br />
     -this would be able to add functions to sb, or to customize it.<br />
2) - dll expandibility.<br />
     -you gave me this idea: in each dll, have support for other nsis-spinoffs, like your language.  the dll would contain the basic info, and then you could choose which language sb would run.<br />
<br />
sound ok?</div></div><hr />
