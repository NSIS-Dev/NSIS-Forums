<br />
I'm wondering if you could help me with this. <br />
<br />
I've got a php script which allows me to upload a file (just a normal HTML form with upload). I'd like to post data to that script and upload a file. <br />
<br />
So, the question is - is it possible to use inetc::post to upload a file?<br />
I guess I can use the TEXT2POST field, but I would have to MIME encode the file as a text and I'm worried that it will not be long enough.<br />
<br />
If it's not possible, have you (or anyone else) got a better idea how to do it? Alternatively, would you be able to enhance inetc, so it's possible?<br />
<br />
I can't use put as it's a IIS server and I can't enable webdav (to allow put).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />
