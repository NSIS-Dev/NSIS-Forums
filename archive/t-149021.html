<br />
but three things that took me more time than they should have in a perfect world :<br />
<br />
problem<br />
the 'Add uninstall information to Add/Remove Programs' code from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixC.html#C.3  failed on my system ( xp ).  the call compiles fine and sets the error flag at runtime.<br />
<br />
sol'n<br />
change the '/'s in the examples to '\'s.  solved this by looking at example .nsi files included with NSIS, ie doc's and product say two different things.<br />
<br />
<br />
problem<br />
no visible way to reliably contact the author of each page of the NSIS docs.  some sections seem to have authors - but that might just be the code authors, not too sure.<br />
<br />
suggested solution<br />
Some pages note no author, some note several authors through the page.  when saying 'author' say author of what: code, section, page etc.  also list way to contact doc author in 'contacts' page, or if unavailable so say.<br />
<br />
<br />
problem<br />
took me ages to find out how to access the error flag, and even then it was by accident.<br />
<br />
suggested solution<br />
add one small section to the NSIS doc's outlining all of the flags in NSIS, and the way(s) to access them.<br />
<br />
<br />
and one thing I haven't had a problem with personally.  I think that just a single line example for each NSIS instruction would help a lot.  It can make NSIS a lot easier to learn first time round ( for some who learn like me ), and it also helps as a quick refresher.  The example .nsi's help a lot in this dept' but I think this is the only thing missing from the NSIS docs overall.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for reading all this.<br />
<br />
Overall i'd have to give NSIS a 9/10.  I've found the code a tad iffy to use ( mmm spagetti code ), and the docs could use a little polish.  But that is all but forgotten with the ease of use and power this thing brings, not to mention the nice looking 'modern ui'.<br />
<br />
Seriously, as soon as I make some money off the product i'm shipping with NSIS there's some beerage going nullsofts way ( at least i hear that's something you don't totally hate :)<br />
<br />
-blayde<br />
<br />
ps i would volunteer to maintain the docs on sourceforge, but like i said i'm busy ATM, but i'd like to later on - having paid my rent first.  even just for a small section of it, under the head doc' guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The documentation was written by pretty much everyone, there is no one author for each page. The only place authors are mentioned is in the useful information page where some of the scripts were taken from the archive.<br />
<br />
There is no doubt the documentation needs some work, but currently we only have a very busy part time documentation writer and no full time writer.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your comments.</div></div><hr />
