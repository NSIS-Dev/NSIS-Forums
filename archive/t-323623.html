<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbd</div><div class="date">31st October 2010, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I am new to NSIS and this forum, and so do not know where this post belongs. The general aim is to install a .jar file and a few other files, together with a JRE launcher to launch the application. If the launcher has been compiled into an exe, and the launcher.exe file is amongst what the installer installs, how can the launcher.exe, without searching on every execution, know where the .jar files were installed, i.e., the $INSTDIR?<br />
<br />
OTOH, if the launcher has not been compiled, so as to expose the launcher code to the $INSTDIR, then how might the launcher get compiled for separate installation from the jar? (i.e, an .exe to launch the application, as opposed to one to install it.)<br />
<br />
It seems that the only recourse would be to install both to the same directory, but even then it might not work unless that directory were chosen by the developer, not the user, at the time that the script is written. <br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance for all replies.</div></div><hr />

Communication may be by environment variable, either temporary or permanent. I have not yet looked at it in detail, but it seems correct.<br />
<br />
The ability to post has helped me to think about this clearly and critically, so thanks.</div></div><hr />
