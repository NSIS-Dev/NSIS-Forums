<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snw</div><div class="date">16th May 2003, 02:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if someone can help - I'm having trouble with what I expected would be a very simple installer.<br />
<br />
I need 3 pages - Welcome, Instfiles and Finish.<br />
What happens is I get the 3 pages, but the Finish page has a &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button, not a &quot;Finish&quot; button. When I hit &quot;Next&quot; I am taken back to the Welcome page and run through these pages again until the second &quot;Finish&quot; page which has a &quot;Finish&quot; button as expected. There is an error in my logic somewhere, but despite all my attempts it is resisting me fixing it.<br />
<br />
Here is what I'm doing (you'll see this if you look at the attached script - hopefully you'll also spot my error!):<br />
I'm setting the outpath based on a registry string (which I manually added to my registry while I test this - if anyone wants to try, they'll need to do the same).<br />
With the &quot;File&quot; command, I'm adding a hierarchy of (empty) directories at the moment while I try to get the &quot;shell&quot; to work.<br />
In the (only) Section there is some commented out code that I need to get back to once this first stage is working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had this problem too, and it took me a little while to figure out my mistake. Insert this line before line 15:<br />
<br />
  !define MUI_CUSTOMPAGECOMMANDS<br />
That should fix it for you!<br />
<br />
Ta,<br />
Dave.</div></div><hr />
