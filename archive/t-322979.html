<br />
I am just wondering if I got the manual wrong or if it's a bug in NSIS?<br />
The manual (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.6.1) says at 4.6.1.2:<br />
<br />
Begins and opens a new section. If section_name is empty, omitted, or begins with a -, then it is a hidden section and the user will not have the option of disabling it. If the section name is 'Uninstall' or is prefixed with 'un.', then it is a an uninstaller section.<br />
<br />
But if you name the section &quot;Uninstall&quot; and make it a hidden one (&quot;-Uninstall&quot;) then it is no longer recognized as an uninstaller section. In this case you have to prefix it with &quot;un.&quot; like any other uninstaller section.<br />
<br />
IMHO this behaviour is at least a bit confusing and a remark in the manual may help ...!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Gunther</div></div><hr />

But when you name it '-Uninstall', it's no longer 'Uninstall' as you just put a minus sign in front :)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why the - in a name is used rather than a flag (a la /SO).. might be legacy.</div></div><hr />

Correct.<br />
That's why I didn't have to ask in the forum and found my mistake at once ... ;)<br />
But it is not that obvious as I interpreted the '-' as a switch and not as part of the section name.<br />
<br />
So I <br />

copy that.<br />
