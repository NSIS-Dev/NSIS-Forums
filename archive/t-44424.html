Rockin'.<br />
I'm actually using it to make an installer for a project a group of my friends and I are working on... It's amazing what you can make an installer do.<br />
<br />
btw - why is NSIS on Betanews.com NOW, as opposed to a while back?... for me, 1.1o was just a regular (almost daily) update, not a super-new-beta.  Whatever.<br />
<br />
Finally, another place to check when I surf the forums. :D<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work, Justin.<br />

What I meant was  this : This forum doesn't need a mod now, it has only been here for 2 days and your all bitching about who should be mod ... And if it does need one Justin will diside ...<br />
And the reason I chose to flame you is because off all your useless bitch posts on the Wa3 forums ... The ones where you typed a Capital Letter On Every Word ! Bitch !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, though, Thor is right.  There aren't enough posts to even require a moderator (yet).  And, yes, Justin or watadoo will choose a mod when this forum does require one.<br />
<br />
I kinda get the feeling that repeatedly asking to be a mod in post after post isn't the best way to improve your chances of becoming one.  :D<br />
<br />
To conclude, I'm sure all of us wouldn't mind being a moderator (I know I wouldn't).  I'm also sure that Justin or watadoo will choose the person whom in their mind would be best to moderate this forum.<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cents.<br />
