<br />
I've just tried using &quot;InstallColors&quot; on NSIS 1.42 (even inverting the colors and using /windows) and have seen no visible effect....</div></div><hr />

<br />
dunno where your problem is .. for me it works fine.<br />
<br />
e.g.:<br />
InstallColors 993300 FFFF00<br />
or <br />
InstallColors /WINDOWS<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbareis</div><div class="date">8th May 2001, 06:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Not exactly a helpful answer, as I said I inverted the colors and this had no effect so WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO EFFECT? It may have an effect somewhere I just want to know where. In case it matters I'm using Windows 2000 SP1. You of course didn't mention your operating system....</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry but what are you talking about?<br />
the command InstallColors defines the colors of the listbox<br />
which shows the details after installing.<br />
<br />
if you inverted the colors the listbox should have had the lime color and the text should have been black<br />
<br />
if you chose /WINDOWS the listbox should have behaved like your windows settings. in my case it is white with black font.<br />
<br />
if you set ShowInstDetails to nevershow the InstallColors command has no effect, as the details are not shown.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbareis</div><div class="date">8th May 2001, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, after your previous response I tried again. This time I displayed the listbox and saw the colors.<br />
<br />
The documentation does not say what the colors are for and I think it would be reasonable for them to affect the installer colors and not just a list box which may or may not be displayed...  For what the command does &quot;ListBoxColors&quot; would have been more appropriate.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm picked a better color, I know what it does and now I'm happy :-)<br />
<br />
Of course if I real &quot;InstallColors&quot; comes along I'll try it out also.<br />
<br />
I could make one small point here, I think that rather than have new commands for all of these types of things (particularly commands whose placement is restricted, I think it would be better to have variables such as perhaps<br />
&quot;$ListBoxBg&quot; and &quot;$ListBoxFg&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />
