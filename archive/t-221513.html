<br />
Ok, what I was trying to ask is, if NSIS is still developed with the plain win32 API, and what are the current plans for the upcoming longhorn, which will have a different API (winFX IIRC); any new stuff being done in CVS, or the dev team will continue to use the winAPI and havent thought of moving to something else like the new API or a cross platform toolkit or even C# or managed C++...<br />
Just a tad curious thats all<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time folks and I hope this gets posted this time...</div></div><hr />

There are no plans to convert the NSIS VM to another language. Using a managed language will add quite some extra overhead.</div></div><hr />
