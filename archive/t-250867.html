<br />
Im just looking into NSIS as i am trying to make a simple installer that installs PHP/MySQL and a website... got the website to install fine, can get the PHP files to install fine and can get the MySQL files to install fine.<br />
<br />
The problem im facing now is that im going to want to edit IIS so that it knows PHP is there, and also start the MySQL service. As im fairly new to this anything passed making sections and adding files to install im a bit lost, so anyone have any info on what im trying to do, or even a link to where i may find out about this?<br />
<br />
Oh! and also while im here i cant seem to find the information out anywhere on the site or in the documentation. How do i go about adding version/company details to the actual EXE so when i go to properties it comes up with the data there?</div></div><hr />

I'm not too familiar with IIS, but if it has a configuration file you can do a search-&gt;replace using the ReplaceInFile function:<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ReplaceInFile<br />
<br />
I have the string &quot;__PHP__&quot; in my httpd.conf file, and whatever the string is for the PHP path, let's say &quot;C:\PHP&quot;, I just do this:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro ReplaceInFile &quot;httpd.conf&quot; &quot;__PHP__&quot; &quot;C:\PHP&quot;<br />
<br />
That worked for me. As far as starting the MySql service, find out what the service is called. I'll assume it's called &quot;mysql&quot;. Then use the following command:<br />
<br />
Exec '&quot;net&quot; start mysql'<br />
<br />
In theory this should work.<br />
