<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wacaveman</div><div class="date">12th August 2007, 00:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing an installer using section groups.  I would like to control the install path for each group.  I managed to hard-code the path by doing a strcpy of $INSTDIR, which works, but the path in the dialog window is no longer correct.<br />
<br />
The next problem, is the uninstaller.  I want to make each section have the capability for it's own uninstaller, but I don't know how to pass information into the uninstaller so it knows where to delete things from.  Currently, it is able to delete the application (thanks to the registry entry, I am sure), but the shortcuts in the startmenu are still swinging in the breeze.  I tried to set a variable in the section, before I call WriteUninstaller, but when it runs, it is blank.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I tried searching, but I was swamped by too many results.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
