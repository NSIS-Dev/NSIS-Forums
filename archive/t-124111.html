<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">While i was working with NSIS, there are a few things that could be better.<br />
First of all the documentation:<br />
- You should add a paragraph describing the style, how the functions are explained ( &quot;|&quot; means or and &quot;[ ]&quot; means optional parameter ). I would like to know: If more than one parameter is optional, can i omit other parameters, when I only like to set the last one?<br />
- You should document the usefull function GetWindowText (used in System.nsh). <br />
- I can hand over more than one parameter to CallInstDll. The second one must be something like functionname. It's is not yet in the documentation.<br />
- Apparently is is not possible to call SendMessage with WM_SETTEXT and the first parameter as LangString variable. Even if it begins with &quot;STR:&quot;. It only works that way: SendMessage &lt;ID&gt; ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 &quot;STR:$(LangString)&quot;. Please add that info.<br />
- More information about SetRebootFlag? Is it only a variable or does the setup automatically reboot, if this flag is set? Is there a MessageBox asking the user, what to do?<br />
- Modern User Interface: Add docu about !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_PUSH. Does the second parameter always have to be the lang. name in English?<br />
<br />
Things regarding the code:<br />
- One function should be able to be called from Install as well as Uninstall. That's not possible because every function called from Uninstall must begin with &quot;un.&quot;.<br />
- What about a function setting these entries in the registry. They add Uninstall information the the Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove Software. Especially the items NoRepair/NoModify made the &quot;(only remove)&quot; string unnecessary.<br />
; Write the uninstall keys for Windows<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;DisplayName&quot; &quot;${MUI_PRODUCT} ${MUI_VERSION}&quot;<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;UninstallString&quot; '&quot;$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe&quot;'<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;Publisher&quot; &quot;Konrad Windszus&quot;<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;URLInfoAbout&quot; &quot;http://www.wincd.de&quot;<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;URLUpdateInfo&quot; &quot;http://www.wincd.de&quot;<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;HelpLink&quot; &quot;http://www.wincd.de&quot;<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;DisplayVersion&quot; &quot;${MUI_VERSION}&quot;<br />
WriteRegDWORD HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;NoModify&quot; 1<br />
WriteRegDWORD HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\WinCD&quot; &quot;NoRepair&quot; 1<br />
- I would like to have another standard page for displaying readme files. I made changes to the license page, but that's very complicated. It should be also a rich edit control.<br />
- Another page with checkboxes for desktop and quicklaunch shortcuts would also be very nice. I made one page and I will supply it in the Archive.<br />
- Last small thing. If you insert custom pages, the caption should start with &quot;:&quot; to be uniform to the others. Perhaps you could automatically add the &quot;:&quot; that the caption is only the raw caption like &quot;Installation Folder&quot; in DirPage.<br />
<br />
At least thank you very much for that great work! NSIS is definitely the best installer for small projects!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed. It's currently a pretty big mess. If a string that starts with / is marked as optional it's really optional. If it doesn't start with / it's usually required if you want to use the next optional parameter (such as in the Page command for example).<br />
 This command is only a temporary solution for the branding text problem. It won't stay in the next version. Therefore it's not documented.<br />
 You must add anoter parameter. It's a typo. Will be fixed.<br />
 Why would you want to send the string as the first parameter? WM_SETTEXT expects the string as the second one.<br />
 The reboot flag should be used by the developer. NSIS doesn't do anything automatically for you. The new modern UI adds a checkbox to the finish page (if exists) if the reboot flag is on.<br />
 I will ask Joost about this.<br />
 NSIS 3.<br />
 What function? What's wrong with writing those lines?<br />
 This will be avaiable in 2.0b2 (b1 should be out this weekend).<br />
 It's so easy to do this with InstallOptions, there is no need to make it a generic NSIS page.<br />
 That's up to the user. Some users might want to spereate the product name from the page name with a dash instead of colon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the quick answer.<br />
- SendMessage with WM_SETTEXT and the second parameter as LangString variable (it was a typo in the first topic) doesn't work. Only &quot;STR:$(LANGSTRING)&quot; does. Why?<br />
- The reboot flag should be used in an example. If i set the reboot flag to true and in the MUI there is a checkbox. What if the user deselects the checkbox. Is the reboot flag then set to false. When (in which function in MUI) should I call Reboot? Is the setup closed first? You should add some more infos or an examle regarding this topic!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">This one actually is documented :)<br />
To send a string param, put STR: before the parameter, for example: &quot;STR:Some string&quot;.<br />
<br />
As a $(something) translates into a string and you want to use it as a string you must put STR: infront of it. If you don't, it will treat it as a number.<br />
<br />
Yep, the reboot checkbox is documented in the MUI docs. We'll add it.<br />
In the MUI if when it reaches the finish page and the reboot flag is on, it will present the user with two options - to reboot now, or later. If the user chooses now the MUI will reboot. If you are not using the MUI you will have to reboot yourself in .onInstSuccess for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know whether is already is, but you, Konrad, should post your 'Uninstallkeys for Windows' sample in the Archive. (no KiCHiK, why I don't do it? Because it's his code!) And maybe KiCHiK can include a small sample in the NSIS package which uses this code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I added a page to the archive under Tutorials, which explains how to create a link in the Windows Control Panel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />
