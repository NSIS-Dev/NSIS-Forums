<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrRadicalEd</div><div class="date">9th October 2003, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started learning this a couple days ago after trying to use other programs.. I feel that NSIS just does what its suppose to do, and that I would prefer to learn NSIS over anything else.. anyway<br />
<br />
I learn by examples, like most other people, and I found that the basic modern UI was a good place to start. I added more than one installer sections, and made the first installer component read only(as it is the core component and must be installed)<br />
<br />
Im having trouble understanding how to have each install section with it's own description.<br />
<br />
Also the installer needs to read two separate registry keys to obtain two separate installation paths. The first one will be for the &quot;core components&quot;, and the second path taken from the registry key will be used for the other install sections the user can select.<br />
<br />
I haven't quite found what I need yet, so if someone can point me in the right direction I would be very thankful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th October 2003, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Search for MUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN in makensis.nsi and ReadRegStr in bigtest.nsi. Those should show you what you need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't believe I didn't pickup on the MUI_FUNCTIONS_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN before. I am trying to absorb all these commands as fast as I can, I sometimes miss things, heh. Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />
