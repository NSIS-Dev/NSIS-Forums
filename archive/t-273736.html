<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durando</div><div class="date">2nd July 2007, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a problem with the process addons I have attempted to use I am not sure if it is because of Vista or not but there is no logical reason that the code shouldn't work.<br />
<br />
The ones i've tried so far are <br />
Processes.dll<br />
FindProcDLL.dll<br />
KillProcDLL<br />
nsProcess.dll<br />
<br />
All I want is for NSIS to detect if blah.exe is running and if it is to tell the user to exit the program and retry or cancel the installation for a later time.<br />
<br />
Every attempt I have made with the Forementioned Plugins has allowed me to continue installation without a warning despite the fact that the process i'm trying to detect is running.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows Vista Ultimate 32bit, I can only assume it is a compatability issue with Vista because I have not been able to try on other versions of Windows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">helix400</div><div class="date">2nd July 2007, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this won't help much :), but I can confirm that what you are trying to do is possible with Windows Vista.  We currently use the Processes plugin, and I haven't had any problems with it killing the requested process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd July 2007, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you're trying to kill a protected process (http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/vista/process_Vista.mspx)? That should be impossible with any plug-in or code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durando</div><div class="date">2nd July 2007, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am not trying to kill a process just find out if its working perhaps i scripted this wrong i'll attach the way i've been using it with no luck.<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
	ReadRegStr $R1 HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Program Manufacturer\Program To Search For\&quot; &quot;InstallPath&quot;<br />
	<br />
	StrCmp $R1 &quot;&quot; ProgNotFound ProgFound<br />
	<br />
	ProgNotFound:<br />
		MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION &quot;The Program this installer needs is not installed on this computer. You must install it to continue with this installation.&quot;<br />
		Quit<br />
	<br />
	ProgFound:<br />
loop:<br />
Processes::FindProcess &quot;Prog&quot;<br />
StrCmp $R0 1 0 done<br />
<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION &quot;The Program this installer needs is running on this computer. You must close it to continue with this installation.&quot;<br />
Quit<br />
<br />
done:<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
If this is not correct please let me know it was put together from example script i have found on the web.</div></div><hr />

I suspect that the FindProcDLL has problems working with Vista because my problem doesn't appear in XP.  Did anybody resolve this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th November 2007, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the installer is elevated and FindProcDLL doesn't find processes created by the elevating user? Try RequestExecutionLevel user and see if it works in that case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">albe</div><div class="date">29th January 2009, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem with the Processes addon and Vista as well.<br />
<br />
I have Vista x64.<br />
Processes finds 32-bit processes OK, but not 64-bit.<br />
<br />
Has anybody found a way to find both 32- and 64-bit processes?</div></div><hr />
