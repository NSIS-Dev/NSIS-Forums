<br />
I am curious as to what attempts, if any, have ever been made to port NSIS to Linux.<br />
<br />
Not the build env, which I see already has been ported, but<br />
to actually make NSIS to build Linux Installers?<br />
<br />
Has attempts been made, and been aborted because its just too painful?<br />
Has it never been attempted?<br />
<br />
There are a few Linux based Installers out there that use a GTK interface as the basis of their &quot;GUI&quot; under Linux.<br />
<br />
If there was an aborted attempt at any point, I would be very interested to see where it ended up...<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />

There doesn't seem to be too much of a point in porting specifically NSIS to Linux. It doesn't have any features unique to Linux like package management and has way too much Windows specific instructions. The only things that'd fit both would be the pages and file extraction. I don't see how the vast investment would result in anything more than just another installer for Linux in which the package managers rule.</div></div><hr />
