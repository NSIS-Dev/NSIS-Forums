<br />
I have to install a driver along with my application.<br />
<br />
wrote a command line code for installation of driver also. and then used &quot;nsExec::Exec&quot; for creating setup. but the problem is it is taking lot of time while installation.<br />
<br />
So while looking for some alternatives i came across <br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=452&amp;instances=0,32<br />
<br />
This seems to satisfy some of my requirements. I am not getting how to use this along with my code. and the only functionality i seek is to install the driver and not starting and stopping of driver service as both of them are being done in my application code.<br />
<br />
any leads??</div></div><hr />
