<br />
I want to make a English/French install.<br />
So in .onInit I check the language of the system, and then I would like to set the text of the LicenseText (and the other install atributs) in French or English.<br />
<br />
The probleme is that the install atributs can not only be set in function or section.<br />
<br />
So how can I do that?<br />
<br />
thanks for your help</div></div><hr />

Let a third installer check the language (let it run silently) and let this script run one of the other installers depending on system language.<br />

BTW, French NSIS available here (http://www.winampfr.com/nsis/).<br />

This is not a good solution because the installer will be 2 times bigger but both install will contain the same files...<br />
Plus, I will have to compile 3 install!<br />
<br />
Isn't there a better way to do it in only ONE script?<br />
<br />
I know very well the WinampFR website :-P</div></div><hr />

I know and nope.<br />
This is the best you can do. With some effort, you can create two tiny installers for the different languages that will be started by a main (silent) installer. Then these custom installers only record settings to the registry (including a setting for finishing the installer or pressing cancel). After &quot;ExecWait&quot; read all necessary regsettings and perform the task.<br />
<br />
If your program is small, the actual install (extract, copy) will not take so much time. A progressbar is not really needed then. The main installer could just have a background and display a message afterwards. If your program is big, show some message (using an external exe or dll), that the installer is busy.<br />
<br />
Other solutions could well exist, but this was my first idea...<br />
<br />
<br />
Or create an installer of only custom pages using InstallOptions. You can control which version (French/English) of each (small!) ini will be extracted and you display the proper one. Using radionbuttons, checkboxes and dirrequest, you can build an installer!<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
For exemple, is it possible to make 2 licences windows?<br />
If so, can I directly go to the one I want and skip the other, depending of the systeme language?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help!</div></div><hr />

No, you could display the different languages in the one lisense window redirecting French people to the lower part of the lisense window at the top. If it is only the LisenseText that you want to have in two languages you can also think of loading the proper text document into Notepad and continue when ExecWait returns.<br />
<br />
But if you also want to have all buttons/strings/etc in two languages, you should create two separate installers / use InstOpts.<br />
<br />
I can remember Justin had the idea to create multilingual support for NSIS, but he is not working on NSIS right now.<br />
