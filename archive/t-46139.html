<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">(M)alone</div><div class="date">2nd April 2001, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is a shameless plug for our new special effects editing software called ALAMDV. Its great for easily adding fantastic special effects to your home movies...go buy it now http://www.alamdv.com :)<br />
<br />
I also thought people would be interested that it uses the latest version of NSIS (well the latest version at the time) for all the installers. Our software is commercial grade, we're are a new company (a team of 3 computing guys) and so far we are doing pretty well.<br />
<br />
I spent ages scouring the net for installer software, and I truly believe this was the best for our needs. And I highly reccomend it to anyone who is condsidering packaging their software.<br />
<br />
I'd also just like to say a big thankyou to Justin (and anyone else who helped out), you really will go down in history as one of the all time greatest computing d00ds.<br />
<br />
oh, and btw, would it be possible to get a listing on the &quot;people/products using NSIS&quot; list? It would really be fantastic to be able to tell my friends im linked on the nullsoft site :)</div></div><hr />
