<br />
I have a small installation that copies files and at the end, runs a few ExecWait calls as it registers services.  When these executables are called, they open up shell windows as they register themselves as windows services.<br />
<br />
Now this works great as a normal install, but since I've added the silent installation code, the service registration doesn't work.<br />
<br />
All of the files are copied over, but I'm wondering if they are not registering as services because they would need to spawn shells to work, or ExecWait doesn't function as I expect it to work when the installation is run as silent.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any hints for me to work around this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about using nsExec::Exec.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the kick in the pants!</div></div><hr />
