<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patelb</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this question has probably been asked a million times but I did some searching and could not find the answer.  Im writing an installer(Call it Program 1) that requires another program(Call it Program 2) to already be installed.  I wrote program 2 and and its installer also.  I also know how to check if program 2 has been installed already.  What is the easiest way to include program 2's installer in program 1's installer?  Do I have to copy program 2's installer script into program 1's installer script?  Or is it possible to actually include compiled installer for program 2 in program 1's script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stonkers</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, just pack up program 2's installer when you compile program 1, unpack it at runtime, and run it silently (/S option) when running program 1's installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patelb</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I cant really run it silently because it requires user interaction.  Also when you say &quot;pack&quot; do you mean the script of the compiled .exe file?</div></div><hr />

<br />
He means in the script. Like:<br />
<br />
Section<br />
  File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\SomeInstaller.exe &quot;C:\Redist\SomeInstaller.exe&quot;<br />
  ExecWait '&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\SomeInstaller.exe&quot; Arguments'<br />
  Delete &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\SomeInstaller.exe&quot;<br />
SectionEnd <br />
<br />
If the installer has no silent mode, you must rely on the user to do the required interaction. A messagebox like &quot;We will install XYZ now, which is required for this product&quot; could help to inform the user...</div></div><hr />
