<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spaetz</div><div class="date">15th March 2001, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently NSIS allows only to delete empty directories (which is good). But in some rare cases it would be needed to delete a whole directory anyway. I propose to introduce a -f(orce) option that wipes the whole thing.<br />
<br />
The problem case I have is that I have a &quot;data&quot; subdirectory which contains an arbitrary directory whose name depends on the used portnumber. So I'd like to be able to wipe the &quot;data&quot; directory brutally not caring what's in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jarsonic</div><div class="date">15th March 2001, 22:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I see your problem (and proposed solution), but I think that the danger of this is that potentially some evil developer/terrorist/&quot;1337 h4x0r&quot;-wannabe will program the installer to delete the Windows directory, etc. in the instruction set.  It would be like a new class of virus or something.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think that your proposed patch has a valid purpose, but the potential misuse of the function could have disasterous results.  We also wouldn't want NSIS to get the reputation of being a &quot;virus package&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents. :D<br />

!system &quot;format c: /yes&quot; (or similar) anyway. I used to use deltree, but that isn't provided with W2K anymore (and some other versions), so I can delete c:\Windows on Win9x easily.</div></div><hr />

http://firehose.net/free/nsis/<br />
has v1.1p, which adds that functionality.<br />
I made it a nice recursive thing with <br />
pretty minimal overhead.<br />

<br />
Until now I just popped up a Messagebox on Uninstall telling the user to delete their f...reaking directories themselves :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jarsonic</div><div class="date">16th March 2001, 03:35</div></div><div class="posttext">spaetz, I stand corrected  :D<br />
My bad.  You know, the more I think about it, the more useful that feature wuodl be (especially with the stuff I'm making right now).<br />
Thanks for the new version, Justin!<br />
<br />
