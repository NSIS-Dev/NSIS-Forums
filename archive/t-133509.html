<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tribe25</div><div class="date">28th April 2003, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I am placing several DLL's into a directory on install. I then need to make sure those DLL's get registered. I am using<br />
<br />
RegDLL &quot;$INSTDIR\lttwn13n.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
It runs the install but after I click ok, it tells me it can't find this file in SEVERAL different places. I am missing something, any help would be great. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me like you've put the DLL in the wrong place and that your program can't find it. Try putting it in the same directory as your program or in the Windows [system] directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tribe25</div><div class="date">28th April 2003, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I am adding 8 DLL's to this directory...<br />
$PROGRAMFILES\AIM\SAFARIREMOTE<br />
<br />
At the end of the code, I am adding...<br />
RegDLL &quot;$INSTDIR\lttwn13n.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
During the install, it places all the files in the proper directories. After the installation, I click close to close the install box. A message then tells me it can not locate the DLL from the path and it list about 17 paths where the file could be located. I have the file in the 1st path it looks for and still no luck.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th April 2003, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you have to register those 8 DLLs too. NSIS doesn't show any message boxes like the one you are describing, it must be a message box coming from your program. Maybe you'll be able to find some information about this error in the documentation of the DLLs, or the program you're trying to install. I can't help much as I know nothing about this program or the DLLs, not even the name :)</div></div><hr />
