<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdm</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">deploying on many servers. some hang up and process doesn't end. since install.log not written until installer finishes, we can't tell how far the installer got. <br />
<br />
is there some way to put time limit on whole install process or each ExecWait call so installer will proceed in any case?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">So you execute a process that does not finish? You can put a message box before each ExecWait call or terminate the process using the Task Manager.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdm</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, one of the exec calls does not finish. not sure which one. this is a silent install...unattended. <br />
I was thinkiing that I could change all the ExecWait calls for Exec a nd Sleep(some time value)..a little sloppy, but it seems like the installer would proceed either way and take longer too. This is not my favorite soln, suggestions are welcome. <br />
Another thing is that install.log works fine if I hit an Abort or finish properly...the log doesn't write if I hang up tho. So solution to the hanging problem would also solve the install.log problem. <br />
<br />
thanks, <br />

You can run it once with some message boxes to find out which process causes the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">install.log is written as the installer goes. It is not flushed, but is written. If you open the log and see nothing, it's probably still waiting in Windows' cache. It should be written once you terminate the installer, and will surely not contain anything that comes after the hanging execution.</div></div><hr />
