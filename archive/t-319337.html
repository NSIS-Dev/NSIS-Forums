<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mattm591</div><div class="date">21st May 2010, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have added a license agreement to my installer.<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE &quot;includes\eula.rtf&quot;<br />
<br />
This RTF document contains several line breaks which display correctly in Wordpad, Word and also in the installer I previously created with InstallShield.<br />
<br />
However, the installer I created with NSIS ignores them and displays as one single line with extra spaces replacing the line breaks.<br />
<br />
Could someone please help me get this to display correctly.<br />
<br />
I'm using the latest NSIS (2.46)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had searched both Google and the NSIS forum before asking the question, the only thing I could find that came close to answering the questions was someone searching for a way to display images within their license agreement and being told they'd need to create a custom page.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping this is not the case for line breaks, so if you could show me a topic where someone has answered the how to show line breaks from an RTF file within the license section that would be helpful, as I am unable to find such a topic myself when searching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't say I've ever had linebreak problems, though.  Could it be that your RTF uses a particular type of linebreak?  I.e. what if you start up wordpad, simply enter:<br />
---<br />
line one<br />
line two<br />
line three<br />
---<br />
save the file as an rtf, and use that file in your installer.. does that display correctly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It turns out that it was just something wrong with the RTF I have, probably to do with the way it was made (I think someone just re-saved a .doc as .rtf).<br />
<br />
I'll recreate the file in WordPad which should solve it.<br />
<br />

I stand corrected, I didn't read your question properly.</div></div><hr />

Will do so in future, and also, many thanks for the nsisXML plugin you've made.<br />
I have found that invaluable for a number of installers!<br />

No worries.</div></div><hr />

Not only does it fix any formatting issues, it also makes the files 1/4 of the original size.</div></div><hr />
