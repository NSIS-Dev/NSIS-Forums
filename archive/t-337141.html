<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">balamdu01</div><div class="date">7th November 2011, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">We install our application in admin privilege and run it in limited user privilege. We install our app in Program files/OwnApp path.<br />
<br />
We are facing the following error message when we try to run it in Limited user privilege - <br />
<br />
&quot;java.sql.SQLException: [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver]General error Unable to open registry key 'Temporary &lt;volatile&gt; Jet DSN for process 0x970 Thread 0xd64 DBC 0x3b3ecc Jet'.&quot; <br />
<br />
The app uses MS Access DB for storing data, and we feel the problem is because we are unable to read from and write to the DB (which is in the install directory) and the permission is limited. <br />
<br />
In Administrative priviledge, If we give full permission for the particular folder i.e. install directory for all the users, then we were able to run the app in limited privilege. How can we give full permission for the particular folder through NSIS code?<br />
<br />
We are using drivers (JDBC - ODBC Bridge driver) for the DB. While opening the DB, it will read some values from the registry and proceed for the further process.<br />
<br />
In limited user priviledge, I think it cant open the registry. And, this might be the problem.<br />
<br />
Can some one please help out. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />
