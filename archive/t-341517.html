<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ptz</div><div class="date">31st January 2012, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to have a single large installer file from which I will only extract parts, depending on the user's choice. How can I achieve this? I only know the &quot;File&quot; command for adding files to the installer, but it seems to have a dual action - it also extracts everything that's been added.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You need individual File instructions and conditionally execute them using LogicLib.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ptz</div><div class="date">31st January 2012, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me rephrase. Suppose I have 2 files that I need to include (this happens at compile time) in my installer so that one of them is extracted (this happens at runtime) depending on user's choice. In order to have both files in my installer file I need to have<br />
File file1<br />
File file2<br />
But this, to the best of my knowledge, will not only add (at compile time) file1 and file2 to the installer, but will also extract (at runtime) both of them without asking. I need to separate the compile-time and runtime events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">31st January 2012, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">${If} [user wants file 1]<br />
  File file1<br />
${EndIf}<br />
${If} [user wants file 2]<br />
  File file2<br />
${EndIf}The compiler will still bundle both files in the package, but will only extract the file (execute the File instruction) if you do not jump over it. Having multiple Sections and a Components page effectively gives you the same behaviour.<br />

I thought I have - but clearly haven't - experiment enough to understand that the compiler will bundle both file1 and file2 with such code.</div></div><hr />
