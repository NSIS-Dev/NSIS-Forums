<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angela_s</div><div class="date">3rd July 2013, 03:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Is there a way to install Dot Net Framework 3.5 (Full Package) on Windows 8 without the internet connection?<br />
<br />
Link to full package here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=25150<br />
<br />
I used to implement ExecWait with the dotnet framework setup file that works fine with OS prior to Windows 7: <br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;$EXEDIR\dotnetfxfolder\dotnetfx35setup.exe /qb /norestart&quot;<br />
<br />
This way it could be installed from this local setup file, that I used to include with the distribution package.  As for Windows 7 there was no need to execute this line as it already has DotNet 3.5 installed. <br />
<br />
The problem is with Windows 8, it seems to require an internet connection even if we have this local dotnet 3.5 framework setup included in the distributed package.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround for this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

The only (legal) option is to require the user to insert the Windows 8 DVD:<br />

I tried it once and it does work.  Because of the need for access to the Windows 8 install DVD, we did not implement the procedure in our installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">6th July 2013, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option, which is the one I took, was to bundle a 2nd set of .NET binaries targeting .NET 4.5 instead of 3.5 which are extracted if the OS is Windows 8 or above. .NET 4.5 is pre-installed with Windows 8 in the same way 3.5 is with Windows 7.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azureusvuze</div><div class="date">8th July 2013, 06:18</div></div><div class="posttext">dotNetFx is available inside ISO of Win 8 setup.<br />
Just extract and run cmd (as admin) with parameters:<br />
DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source:&quot;Win8_sources_path&quot;<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source:&quot;C:\Win8\sources\sxs&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpderuiter</div><div class="date">8th July 2013, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">That is illegal, because nobody is allowed to distribute part of anything that is under copyright of Microsoft without agreement of Microsoft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">8th July 2013, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't distribute any ISO to use the DISM command; it's effectively the same as using &quot;Turn Windows features on or off&quot; dialog. If the image (for .NET 3.5) isn't present on the hard drive then it will be downloaded or you will be asked to insert your install disc. However I have tried using DISM to uninstall .NET 3.5 on Windows 8 and we had reports of it getting stuck on the uninstall.<br />
