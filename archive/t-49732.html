Has there been any additional work on this front or would anyone be interested in starting it up?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SENCO</div><div class="date">14th May 2001, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey,<br />
<br />
   I have translated the EXE Header of NSIS in order to use with my spanish language pack (www.winamp.es.org).<br />
<br />
   It was a very hard task, because I had to read all the code and then translate it. I thought on put it on a .rc file but I believe that it would make bigger the header. The solution I have thought is put them on a .h file using the #DEFINE instruction. The compiled code it would be the same, but it's easier to translate.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

<br />
with defines I´ll be more easier. Now we mut translate every new version. I thinks that defines must include syntax.<br />
<br />
In spanish case the &quot;$s setup&quot; can´t be translated just changing the word &quot;setup&quot; it must be &quot;instalador %s&quot; or something like that. So i propose that the includes includes all the sentence instead just words.<br />
<br />
I can do it, but I don´t know how the other developers will synchronize the versions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">matt weagle</div><div class="date">14th May 2001, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been looking at the source and am trying to come up with a good way to handle this.  I'd rather not have to build EXEs for each language, but agree that RC files might introduce additional overhead.  What about defining the strings in a &quot;String Configuration Header&quot; part of the NSI file itself?  We set up &quot;string IDs&quot; which can be set just like OutFile or SilentInstall.  If a given string exists in the NSI file, it supercedes whatever's coded in the EXE file.  Does anyone see problems with this approach?  Or should I ask instead, how many problems do people see with this approach ;-) ?  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
