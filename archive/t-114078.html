<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Please provide some more details... What exactly doesn't work? Does it show the image and doesn't play the sound? Does it ignore your transperncy settings? What exactly is wrong?<br />
<br />
Please attach the script too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mjalan</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The image doesn't show and I just copy the script from the example that is in AdvSplash folder, and I just change the path for it. It works in the last week build, but not the Tuesday one. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The example works perfectly fine for me. Please attach your script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brainsucker</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. For the first I really found some bug in advsplash, but I don't know is it the problem of mjalan. <br />
Example of the bug is in kichik's example (example.nsi): I've got no second splash at my winXP. The solution is easy, the second splash couldn't re-register the window class, which left after the first splash (comment from MSDN for RegisterClass: Windows NT/2000/XP: No window classes registered by a .dll are unregistered when the .dll is unloaded. A .dll must explicitly unregister its classes when it is unloaded.). <br />
<br />
So, all the other plugins (simple splash for example) should be updated with UnregisterClass too.<br />
<br />
The second problem was described in kichik's PM to me: the same second splash shows the black rectangle under the splash itself (win2k/xp only). Actually that's not my problem, but a bug from microsoft (who would like to report? ;), whenever window height is smaller than some value, applying the WS_EX_LAYERED style will set window size to that value :). And this value is very similar to the size of window title bar. <br />
<br />
Solution... hm... Use pure black (=0) as keycolor (and area will disappear), or use images larger than toolbar size... <br />
<br />
I'm planned new advsplash version, but it requires some time... Will start the work ASAIWHAFTFTNGACSPOMB (As Soon As I Will Have A Free Time From The Next Great And Cool Software Project Of My Boss)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th November 2002, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... Look what I found in the same page about RegisterClass... Line after line:<br />
<br />
All window classes registered by a dynamic-link library (DLL) are unregistered when the DLL is unloaded.<br />
<br />
No window classes registered by a DLL are unregistered when the DLL is unloaded. A DLL must explicitly unregister its classes when it is unloaded.<br />
<br />
:eek: :weird:<br />
<br />
Geee... :mad:<br />
<br />
I have added UnregisterClass to splash and BgImage just in case...</div></div><hr />
