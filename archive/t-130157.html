<br />
I get this when I run my logging program.<br />
<br />
It happens after the 'Medic Heals' count, which makes you assume that it is the 'Medic Heals' count function, or maybe the next count function that is causing this error.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
If I blank out the Calls for all functions accept the first function (for getting the 'kills' count,) then instead I get this error appearing from that function instead!<br />
<br />
Is this some bug being caused by the compiler?<br />
<br />
opcode, I assumed the IntOp, but that looks fine:<br />
<br />
<br />
IntOp $3 $3 + 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Another problem I have:<br />
I have a Custom Page MainPage in my script, and then I have a InstFiles page. However, the Next &gt; button on the Custom Page doesn't go to the InstFiles page, but instead does nothing.<br />
<br />
I have included the whole script below.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The next button that does nothing was caused because you had only that custom page defined and no other page. When using Page you have to define all of the pages that your installer is using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have narrowed it down to the SpecialKillsCount, because clearing the whole of that function fixes it.<br />
I'm now going to remove parts of the function until it stops happening.<br />

<br />
<br />
   Push $1<br />
   Push &quot;${NAME}'s handgrenade&quot;<br />
    Call StrStr<br />
     Pop $2<br />
<br />
      # Add to count<br />
      StrCmp $2 &quot;&quot; +3<br />
      IntOp $7 $7 + 1<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG wait...<br />
I haven't changed the +3 to a +2!!!<br />
ACK<br />
It works now.<br />
