<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ldajunk</div><div class="date">22nd March 2005, 23:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm implementing a simple audio editor. On my XP-Home-Sp2 development computer, I'm having problems writing files to the installation directory and its subdirectories:<br />
C:\Program Files\CleanSpeech\cleaned<br />
<br />
This installation goes fine. Also, the main app can write to $INSTDIR\cleaned. The problem is when a console app is invoked by the main application that writes to $INSTDIR\cleaned. This fails for some reason. The invoked console app can write to other non-system directories with no problems.<br />
<br />
I use the NSIS command<br />
CreateDirectory $INSTDIR\cleaned<br />
to create the directory.<br />
<br />
Is there something special or protected about this $INSTDIR directory? When I look at its attributes, I see the ReadOnly box with solid colors. It isn't cleared or checked, but solid. When I clear it, the next time I look, it is back to solid again. My impression is that this means some files are read-only, and some aren't.<br />
<br />
Is there somewhat to allow this installation directory to be written to by an invoked console app? Does this problem not occur with Win2000 and Win9x?</div></div><hr />

<br />
GetFullPathName /SHORT $R1 &quot;$INSTDIR\cleaned&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
THANKS!</div></div><hr />
