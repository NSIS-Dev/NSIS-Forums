<br />
This might've made the difference. I had just uninstalled an earlier version of NSIS, along with some other apps without rebooting before installing the new version of NSIS.<br />
<br />
If this new installation was supposed to shutdown and reboot your machine, I find it kind of offensive without asking first. :)<br />
<br />
Running:<br />
win2k SP2</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dark Ryder</div><div class="date">26th March 2003, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to reboot; it just installed and then offered to display the readme when I ran it.  Have you tried it again, now that you have (perforce) rebooted after uninstalling?</div></div><hr />

Was not a normal reboot. Was playing mp3's with winamp 2.*, the screen went black, the mp3 got &quot;stuck&quot;, then it rebooted. Didn't shut down any apps though, that I could tell.<br />
<br />
Dark Ryder:<br />
I did end up reinstalling. Kind of. During the initial install, I mistakenly unchecked the &quot;shell extension&quot; option, so I went back through, just to install that bit. And it completed like it was supposed to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, according to your description it doesn't seem like the Reboot command was somehow called. I have never heard of such a bug... Have you ever experienced such problems before? Have you lately installed new drivers or applications but NSIS? Do you have a VIA chipset?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not so common that I hear about crashing or instant rebooting NSIS installers, but this is a suggestion:<br />
Let the installer log it's actions to a file in a temporary directory. When the installer finishes correctly, that file is deleted. When it doesn't, that file is still there and can be read for reference.<br />
The file may just be a bunch of computer code instructions, as long as there is a program that can make them readable for humans.</div></div><hr />

I haven't installed new drivers. Although, I did briefly have win2k SP3 installed. I then removed it. But I don't think that would have caused this crash. And no, I haven't experienced this type of crash before with NSIS. I want to think it had to do with a combination of things, and not directly with NSIS though. If I remember correctly I was running CuteFTP Pro 2, which I have had problems before mostly memory issues, Opera 7.03, Winamp 2.80. I think those were the major apps that I had been running. Other than that I don't know what else to tell ya.</div></div><hr />

Please let me know if it happens again.</div></div><hr />
