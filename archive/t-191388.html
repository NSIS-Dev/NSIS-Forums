<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbdann</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 06:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm new to the NSIS, and never really used any other type of installer either. I've spent hours on this, and I keep running into more and more problems. I read the faq, and that did help, but also introduced more problems :).<br />
<br />
I wrote a program that contains two exe's. Here is what i want to do. ( please note that I also want to use the VB6 runtimes, which i found a faq on how to do.)<br />
<br />
<br />
INSTALLER:<br />
1. prompt the user and install exe's to (by default) C:\program files\my program\*.exe<br />
2. I want to create a shortcut on the desktop and in the start menu for A.exe.<br />
3. I want to (without prompting) create a shortcut in the &quot;startup&quot; folder for B.exe<br />
(or some other method of getting it to start automatically is fine too).<br />
<br />
DE-INSTALLER:<br />
1. remove all shortcuts that i originally made.<br />
2. remove the C:\program files\my program folder (including the biniaries).<br />
3.remove a single registry key that the program generates.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone already have a script that can do exactly this, or know how to implement this?<br />
<br />
Thank you much!</div></div><hr />
