<br />
Due to the weird way windows works :D command lines issued with spaces may or may not work. When using switches, they usually never work.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to add a key to the registry that installs a service, and the executeable requires a switch to know how to behave. To properly stick this in the registry (with quotes around the path), I have to include double quotes in the string, eg:<br />
<br />
&quot;C:\Program Files\...&quot; -service<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;&quot; are part of the string (not added by regedit), and without them it'll b0rk out and die.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to figure out how to escape the strings, and if I use single quotes to contain the double quotes (and switch), NSIS can't see the string.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Does this help you?<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
