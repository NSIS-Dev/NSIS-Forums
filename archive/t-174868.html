<br />
is it possible to compile an *.exe with the installation of the main application? <br />
<br />
The idea behind is that my application installs several services which I want to uninstall at one time with a small exe. <br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">31st March 2004, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You can extract the executable to a temporary location (the plug-ins folder) and execute it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mosestycoon</div><div class="date">31st March 2004, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, think my question was not that clear Joost<br />
<br />
I built an application with several services. Everything works fine with NSIS compiling it (FAT tool your NSIS :D).<br />
<br />
So as I am developing several versions at once I would like to uninstall just the services (as they always have the same name in every version) at one time to install another version of the application. All services could be stopped with 'net stop &lt;service&gt;' and I could write a small application which is global valid (without pathes), but this won't work for un-installing the services. <br />
<br />
My idea (or question?) was to take the installation routine, grep the installation path (from userinput, normally installation directory) for the services and bring them (the pathes) together in another application which is compiled during the installation routine. <br />
<br />
The result should be a small exe with some nsExec::Exec '&quot;Path\to\service&quot; -uninstall'<br />
which could be executed to uninstall all services (just services) at one time.<br />
<br />
Can this be achieved?</div></div><hr />

When the sselect what services they wnt in the main installer, it extracts the service installers to a temp folder and runs them.</div></div><hr />

(Had a hard day yesterday :igor: )<br />
I understand, but that wouldn't be a distributable solution as all service  binaries would blow up the installer about 20MB (extracted)...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">1st April 2004, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">What exactly is your question? Do you want your installer to compile another installer?<br />
<br />
Why not create one uninstaller that can handle everything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mosestycoon</div><div class="date">3rd April 2004, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Great idea.<br />
<br />
Yeah I thought of another installer (or uninstaller) compiled during installation of the application. So the output (the little exe) should be able to uninstall (only!) services installed with the main installation routine.<br />
<br />
But the idea of using an uninstaller is great. Can I built two uninstaller? According to this topic a global one and one that *IS* the app I am looking for? This one should not self-delete...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mosestycoon</div><div class="date">3rd April 2004, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the uninstaller should be left untouched as it has to uninstall sometimes. And the little application I was talking off could be run several times (everytime I need it..)<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">3rd April 2004, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also use an uninstaller components page, then you can select what components to uninstall.</div></div><hr />
