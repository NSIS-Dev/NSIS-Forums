<br />
Please Help!<br />
<br />
I just downloaded and installed NSIS, and HM NIS Edit.  Im trying to use the script wizard to create my first installation script.  I want to see what it creates, adn then start customizing the script to do exactly what I want it to do.<br />
<br />
The Application Information Screen is no problem, I enter all the values for my Application, then hit Next.<br />
<br />
On the second screen (Setup Options) I have Setup Icon, then Setup File, then Setup Lang:.  I can type into the boxes for Icon and File, but Setup Lang is like a large select box, or text area, which I can't type into, have no options in.  Under that I have GUI and Compress.  These I can set just fine.<br />
<br />
When I hit Next, having not been able to select anything in the language box, it says &quot;Please specify the setup lang.&quot; .. which I would LOVE to do :mad: <br />
<br />
It wont let me continue the wizard!  <br />
<br />
I have tried installing the editor to its default directory, instead of where I want it, and I tried copying the .lng files out to the root of the app, to see if it couldnt see them.<br />
<br />
Also, I tried a fresh install on my machine at the office (Both are Windows XP with SP2) and neither works. <br />
<br />
Please help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">druman</div><div class="date">10th October 2004, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I had installed version 1.98 of NSIS, and tried to use version 2.0.1 of NIS Edit... they aren't compatible.<br />
<br />
As soon as I installed NSIS Release Candidate 4 (nsis20rc4.exe), and reinstalled NIS Edit 2.0.1.. it worked fine.<br />
<br />
You can find these files here : <br />
