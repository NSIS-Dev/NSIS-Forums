<br />
i'm trying to send silent emails from the client, after a customer has  installed my setup.exe...<br />
<br />
this email should only be an information for myself...<br />
<br />
how can do this with nsis...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">2nd November 2006, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">you can't just with nsis, but you could include any of many command line e-mailers and do a silent execution of that.  I've used &quot;blat&quot; myself in an IRC bot before I learned sockets - but there's many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">el'Diabolo</div><div class="date">2nd November 2006, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">well, but I think it won't work like that.<br />
I had visited the URL's...<br />
<br />
very confusing...<br />
<br />
email sending should be hidden for the customer, that he doesn't know it...<br />
<br />
isn't there an easier way to go???<br />
<br />
maybe .vbs   or something else???<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd November 2006, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">blat is a command line application. You can run it with the nsExec plug-in to hide the console window, if it even shows one. You can't get much more silent than that.<br />
<br />
On a side note, you should be aware that doing something like that in your application or your installer will be considered by most as a violation of their privacy. &quot;Calling home&quot; by sending e-mails or visiting websites, even if not for collecting information (which is usually not the case), without the user's knowledge would get average Joe pissed. Furthermore, most modern anti-virus software will warn the user of this activity in some way, especially if done from  VBScript.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">3rd November 2006, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed... I was presuming this was under a custom page that allows the user to send feedback / some manner of registration info (if you don't have a web server), etc.<br />
<br />
The installer I'm working on, for example, has an option to check up-to-dateness online, but even that is behind a button that the user is free to press or not.<br />
<br />
Your software -will- quickly be labeled spyware if you don't make that e-mail optional, or at least clearly state that an e-mail would be sent.</div></div><hr />
