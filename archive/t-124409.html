<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenolan</div><div class="date">9th February 2003, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been twiddling with DLL's for Regina/Rexx and I started out using one of the samples and then ran riot from there... :D <br />
<br />
Trying to do somethings for NSIS (as that's what we have decided to use for ditributing our free Trainz scenarios).<br />
<br />
I am trying to compile advsplash with bcc but seem to have brain lock, tried to install mingw and brain exploded :eek: would someone be able to give me the bcc32/linker lines that should give me a workable DLL, then I can cause havoc from there.<br />
<br />
Looked in the conference and couldn't see anything dealing with compiling the DLL's perhaps I am just trying too hard with too many things at once .. <br />
<br />
Thanks .. Larry</div></div><hr />

Maybe you already know this, but I read your message as though you'd only tried bcc and not VC, and you didn't say you can't use VC. Anyhow probably a useless response, I'm tired, good night :D</div></div><hr />
