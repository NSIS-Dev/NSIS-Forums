<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgt-d</div><div class="date">19th May 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been checking the changes to NSIS periodically and I've seen a lot of fixes for nsisdl.dll --- but nobody has added PBS_SMOOTH to the dll yet.  Is someone looking into this?<br />
<br />
Also, I was wondering if there was going to be a way in your NSIS script to add a Version Info tabsheet --- or if we will have to stick with the current method using Resource Hacker.  I would prefer to have NSIS do this because if you use Resource Hacker to add the Version tab, you can't use crc checking on your executable, or so I've read.<br />
<br />
There are some other outstanding issues, but isn't it time for Beta 4?<br />
<br />
Or skip the pre-release and make it official!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
as mentioned in this post: (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=133858&amp;highlight=nsisdl+smooth) <br />
<br />
NSISdlSmooth is an old version of NSISdl with smooth progress bar. To create a new NSISdlSmooth open NSISdl.dll in a resource editor such as Resource Hacker and add the PBS_SMOOTH style to the progress bar. -kichikin my post i was refering to the newer NSISdl, not the older NSISdlSmooth.<br />
<br />
so, i'm wondering when they will add PBS_SMOOTH to the newer NSISdl.<br />
<br />
sorry for any confusion.  :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need to disable CRC when using !packhdr. You only need to disable CRC if you want to edit the installer after it's created by NSIS.<br />
<br />
NSIS b4 will be released when it's ready :)</div></div><hr />
