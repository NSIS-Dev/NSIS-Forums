<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ntd</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the latest version of NSIS and the HM NIS Edit to try out. I used the HM NIS Edit wizard to create a basic installer as a test.<br />
<br />
My problem is, on the uninstall it won't delete the desktop shortcut, or the start menu folder and shortcut. I am running Windows 2000, and on an Admin account.<br />
<br />
I tried searching through past threads and have seen this problem talked about. I tried adding the &quot;SetShellVarContext all&quot; and does not affect the problem. I haven't found anything else that helps. It is using the variables $SMPROGRAMS and $DESKTOP for the paths.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why the the wizard on HM NIS Edit would create a script with problems. Is there something else I have overlooked, or can check?<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Edit: I realized I had a &quot;/&quot; in the original shortcut name. :o Now I feel dumb for overlooking that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never noticed that talked about, so I guess I'll have to search around some more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rightclick on the Shortcut and look where it residents.<br />
<br />
If it's in &quot;C:\documents and settings\All users\Desktop&quot; than<br />
&quot;SetShellVarContext all&quot; is neccesary. If it's in your user account than you have to take into consideration that nsis can't know automatically which user has installed it.</div></div><hr />
