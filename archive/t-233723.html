<br />
Anyone know how NSIS finds out the $WINDIR location? is it from the registry?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your servers seems to be a Windows Terminal-Server in application-mode.<br />
<br />
Try to execute the following command:<br />
change user /install<br />
and then start your installer again. You'll see, that $WINDIR contains the correct path.<br />
<br />
After the installation:<br />
change user /execute<br />
<br />
This behaviour is normal. Probably you find more information here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sekator</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, correct...we were installing while connected to a server via Remote Desktop...I can't really see how this could be deemed normal behavior...$WINDIR pointing to what is definitely the wrong directory. Isn't this something NSIS could handle transparently? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">There's nothing to handle, that's how it's supposed to work according to Microsoft. If you want to get the system Windows directory, you can call GetSystemWindowsDirectory (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/getsystemwindowsdirectory.asp) using the System plug-in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bholliger</div><div class="date">23rd December 2005, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This behaviour is by design (or grown by history...). Let's try to explain:<br />
<br />
Windows was a single user system.<br />
Every program had it's INI-files in the windows-directory.<br />
One day, there was the need to build a multi-user system.<br />
<br />
Now there was a problem: Because multiple users are working on the same system, every user would mess up other users INI-files. The solution: Programs, that write to INI-Files are redirected to another user specific folder.<br />
<br />
To install new applications you have to execute &quot;change user /install&quot; to set Windows in install mode.<br />
<br />
That's the secret explained in a few simple words.</div></div><hr />

Can you tell me the correct line?<br />
<br />
System::Call &quot;Kernel32.dll:GetSystemWindowsDirectory...&quot; ???</div></div><hr />
