<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lancerman</div><div class="date">10th October 2007, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello! I'm trying to figure out how to make a script that would allow a certain program be CD independent(CD ROM Virtualization?). I'm making installer scripts for cd dependent programs and I can't seem to remove that dependency. Does anyone have any suggestions/advices?<br />
<br />
:weird:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CancerFace</div><div class="date">11th October 2007, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Excuse my ignorance, but what exactly is a &quot;cd dependent program&quot;? Does it mean that you run it from a CD and as such it requires the CD to be present?<br />
<br />
If yes, then why not make your program copy itself, or another program, to a temporary location on the system's HDD then spawn a new process from that temporary location?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lancerman</div><div class="date">12th October 2007, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">What I mean with CD Dependent Programs is that you install a certain program (like a game) and when you run the program from the HD installation, it requires you to have the CD in your CD ROM drive.<br />
<br />
This happens mostly for games, and it could either be that the installation does not include huge files (videos, movies, etc) or that the EXE file still links to the CD ROM drive even if all the files from the CD were installed in the HD (a registry  issue perhaps).<br />
<br />
So I'm just wondering if anyone has a solution in NSIS to eliminate this CD dependency (CD ROM Virtualization). I understand that you could &quot;fool&quot; the CD dependent program by copying the CD contents to the HD and saying that the CD is &quot;in the hard drive&quot;. I hope to do that together with my NSIS scripts.</div></div><hr />

Hence why there are 'no-cd' cracks for applications - modified versions of the executables.<br />
