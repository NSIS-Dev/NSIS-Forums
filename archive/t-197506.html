<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nirious</div><div class="date">26th October 2004, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">In the components page, you can select what componenets to install.<br />
I have two of them.<br />
Is there a way to let the user only select one of them. So one excludes the other.<br />
It can be directly by (un)checking the other box. Or when he presses NEXT by a messagebox and disallowing him to continue.<br />
<br />
Thx for helping.<br />
<br />
BTW is ther anywhere a reference for all those macro's and functions etc. Cus the helpfile wasn't very helpfull:cry:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a search and found some threads.<br />
I also took a look at the select_one file, but I don't have any subsections, I only have two mainsections. You can either install the first or the second, not non and not both.<br />
<br />
I just want to know how to unckeck one item (I have two) when the user checks the other one. The second one is unchecked by default.<br />
<br />
I have two sections SEC01 and SEC02<br />
<br />
I know its in the .onSelChange function, but I don't know what to put there.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;On select changed, deselect the other &gt;&gt;<br />
Now that can't be hard for someone with more experience than me.</div></div><hr />
