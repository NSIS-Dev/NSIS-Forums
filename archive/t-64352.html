Perhaps Justin could add it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ExoticMandibles</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I've released a variant of NSIS called NSIS(lch) which allows you to call specially-written DLLs.  You can't call any function you want, just functions written specifically for NSIS(lch), which I bet isn't what you have.<br />
<br />
You can also use Microsoft's RUNDLL32 to call DLLs... but, again, the entry-point has to be custom-written to conform to what RUNDLL32 expects.<br />
<br />
Calling an function in a DLL with arbitrary parameters from interpreted code is hairy, but it can be done; I contributed code to the FICL (FORTH-like) interpreter that does it.  But the NSIS scripting language, such as it is, would kinda make it even harder.<br />
<br />
I suggest you go with a custom .EXE that calls the function.<br />

I just was wondering how the return value could be read. Maybe by using enviroment variables to pass strings and such ..<br />
<br />
That is not a problem if the dll function needs to be custom. I would have made the dll myself anyway..</div></div><hr />
