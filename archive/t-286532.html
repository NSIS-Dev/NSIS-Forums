<br />
I build a big installer (300Mo). If I launch it from a CD with Windows Vista, I can wait 1 minute before seeing the start message. I don't wait so long with Windows XP.<br />
<br />
I think Windows Vista verify the installer before the launch. How can I avoid it? Can I divide the installer in severals packages (10 Mo each for example)? Then Windows Vista may only verify the first package (with exe extension).<br />
<br />
Help!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Using 7zip.exe we generate zip files which are split into equal sized parts.<br />
2. I then wrote a simple wrapper around the 7za.exe command line tool, which made the exe into a simple plugin.  (i.e. it would accept command line input.) <br />
3. The installer scripts then, use the plugin to unzip the files.<br />
<br />
See for information about 7zip:<br />
  www.7-zip.org<br />
<br />
Now our executables are in the 8GB range, also we have a whole frame work put together which builds the targets for us.  If you are only doing this for one installer, I'd suggest using a make file.</div></div><hr />
