<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jammusi</div><div class="date">9th February 2010, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
1. Enabling the Cancel button on the finish page <br />
   Either with !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_CANCEL_ENABLED) or <br />
   by calling EnableWindow on the cancel button handle<br />
<br />
2. Register to the click event of the button<br />
   Either by !define MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_ABORT or<br />
   Register to the click event with NSD_OnClick within the finish page show function <br />
<br />
3. When including MUI2 the button really becomes enabled <br />
   BUT<br />
   Clicking the button - does not reach the click callback<br />
   WHY?<br />
<br />
4. When I have changed MUI2 to MUI the callback was called  <br />
   BUT<br />
   The installer was not closed.<br />
   I have tried either Quit or Abort instructions<br />
   WHY?<br />
<br />
So just to summarize - 2 questions please:<br />
<br />
1. Why when using the MUI2 - the click callback is not called<br />
2. Why the installer is not closed when the callback is called (when using MUI). How to close the installer?<br />
<br />
Tx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jammusi</div><div class="date">10th February 2010, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently MUI_FINISHPAGE_CANCEL_ENABLED is the issue.<br />
Not that I understand why is that - I guess it is a bug???<br />
<br />
When I use MUI_FINISHPAGE_CANCEL_ENABLED to enable the Cancel button (and only while using mui2) two things had happened:<br />
1. The Click callback wan not called<br />
2. The installer was not terminated<br />
<br />
When I enabled the button withing the Show function of the page - I left MUI_FINISHPAGE_CANCEL_ENABLED was still there. This is why it had no affect.<br />
Only when i marked the define - things had become OK.<br />
<br />
Is this a deliberate behavior?<br />
<br />
More over:<br />
<br />
I dove a bit into the setup file and discover the following code in the interface.nsh<br />
<br />
!macro MUI_FUNCTION_ABORTWARNING<br />
<br />
  Function .onUserAbort<br />
	<br />
	<br />
    !ifdef MUI_PAGE_FUNCTION_ABORTWARNING		<br />
      Call ${MUI_PAGE_FUNCTION_ABORTWARNING}<br />
    !endif<br />
  <br />
    !ifdef MUI_ABORTWARNING		<br />
      !insertmacro MUI_ABORTWARNING<br />
    !endif<br />
    <br />
    !ifdef MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_ABORT	<br />
      Call &quot;${MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_ABORT}&quot;<br />
    !endif<br />
    <br />
  FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
I had found that the MUI_PAGE_FUNCTION_ABORTWARNING is defined although NOT in my script<br />
and even when i have undef this in the script - it always was there.<br />
<br />
Now - when clicking the cancel button and since the  MUI_PAGE_FUNCTION_ABORTWARNING was defined somehow, execution went into that if - and never &quot;came back&quot;.<br />
<br />
When I marked this ifdef the cancel button got back its expected behavior (at least that's what I would expect), even when MUI_FINISHPAGE_CANCEL_ENABLED was used.</div></div><hr />
