I'm using zip2exe and it will extract the files to the proper directory but i don't know how to tell it to run a specific file from that directory after extracting.  Thanks for any help you can give.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a few options:<br />
Option #1:<br />
You might be able to modify the base.nsh file (located in ${NSISDIR}\Contrib\zip2exe). But, you'd have to modify this each time you ran if the EXE changes with each compile.<br />
<br />
Option #2:<br />
Use another self-extracting utility from the Wiki<br />
<br />
Option #3:<br />
Create your own self-extracting utility using InstallOptions.  <br />
<br />
The idea in option 3 is that you'd build 2 installation.  The first would be a wizard style interface that would output a header file.  The 2nd would then use that header file to compile a self-extractor which you'd send to the end-user.  (You'd have to include a plugin that could extract ZIP files.  There's some on the wiki if you need.)</div></div><hr />
