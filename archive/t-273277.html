<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McMate</div><div class="date">23rd June 2007, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello.  I have two issues with my script that I have spent a fair amount of time into trying to understand but haven't been able to resolve.  I would be grateful if some assistance could be provided.<br />
<br />
The first issue relates to custom pages.  I have defined MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_LEAVE with the function 'InstallTypeinserted'.  It is supposed to run after MUI_PAGE_COMPONENTS to determine whether to skip NavigateDBLocation or not.  The idea is that if $1 had the value of '0' then skip the custom page but if $1 was '1' or '2' then essentially not to skip.<br />
<br />
It also became apparent to me that I made a generous error in my understanding of the procedure of page loading.  What I mean by that I can't work out why I needed to put MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_LEAVE where it is.  I had thought that it in the script it would be like this:<br />
<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_WELCOME<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE &quot;LICENSE AGREEMENT - Records.txt&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_COMPONENTS<br />
  !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_LEAVE InstallType<br />
  Page custom NavigateDBLocation<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
<br />
It seems that I was wrong.<br />
<br />
The second issue relates to the page skip itself.  In the function InstallType, I have been able to demonstrate that the values shown in the message box do in fact correlate to the radiobutton selection that denotes the type of install in MUI_PAGE_COMPONENTS.  The bit that I can't get is how to do the actual page skip.<br />
<br />
Please find the essence of the script attached, and many thanks for your help.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also, to define a custom pre, show or leave function for MUI pages the define must come before not after the page insertion.<br />
