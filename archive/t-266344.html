<br />
The installer that I'm creating has to be able to edit the &quot;boot.ini&quot; file in order to start my application.  After first glance this was easy to edit and it was working great.  However, the more people that used it, the more I found that this file is not always located at the root of the C:\ drive.    I need a way to find this &quot;boot.ini&quot; as it will be located on the active partition of the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Is/are there any ways to detect the partitions on a computer and determine which partition is active?  From what I've found, it doesn't seem to be easy.<br />
<br />
My other thought would be to do a file search on the root of every hard drive detected.  This wouldn't be such a problem other than all of the search functions require a path.  Can you loop through a list of different hard drives?  Any examples?<br />
<br />
Or do any of you guys have a better idea that would be more feasible?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThorMX</div><div class="date">22nd February 2007, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">%SYSTEMDRIVE% is a no-go.  It would work great so long as the drive you have Windows installed on is also the active partition.  Here 2 examples:<br />
<br />
1.  1 hard drive, 1 partition.  Everything will be located on your C:\ drive, this includes all boot items.<br />
<br />
2.  multiple hard drives, multiple partitions.  If you install Windows to the D:\ drive, your system drive will be the D:\ drive.  However, all of your boot information will be stored on the active partition (most likely the C:\ partition or the partition that is set to active)<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />
