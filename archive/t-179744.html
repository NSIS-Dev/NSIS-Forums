<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Latem</div><div class="date">12th May 2004, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I just got NSIS, so I am very much a newbie. I used HM NIS Editor and its Wizard to make a simple install for an application I am working on. The application is written in VB.NET, and my boss would like me to distribute the framework, and install it if needed, with the installer for the application. I have a few questions regarding this issue.<br />
<br />
I found the nifty little function to detect .NET framework in the Documentation (and in the archives), and I got it to work with my script. I also read in the forums that you should place this in the on.Init function, or something like that. I didnt fully understand that.  Right now this is what I do:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;GLS&quot; SEC01<br />
  Call IsDotNETInstalled<br />
     Pop $R3<br />
  StrCmp $R3 0 +3<br />
    Goto +2<br />
    ; else<br />
    MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Can't find .NET!&quot;<br />
    ...And as you can see this code is at the start of my main &quot;section&quot;. My first question is if putting that in onInit is more correct how do I do that? Do I go Function SEC01.onInit or something like that, and place the code there. And then where/how do I call the function?<br />
<br />
My second question is how do I get the installer to install the .NET Framework. So, how do I package dotnetfx.exe into my installer, and then how do I get it to run that file (instead of the MessageBox part). I couldn't find an example of this anywhere. <br />
<br />
I am kinda under time pressure, so I havent looked at the docs in great detail, so Im not familiar with much yet. That's also why I am asking for help. Sorry if this is supposed to be &quot;common&quot; knowledge or something, and I am asking how to do it. <br />
<br />
Aside, from my little experince with NSIS, it seems like its a pretty cool system. And definitly different from MS Visual Studio Installer tool.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

<br />
onInit isn't a section, it's a function which is called right after starting the exe so you should define your onInit function like below on the very first beginning of your script<br />
<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
     Call IsDotNETInstalled <br />
          Pop $R3 <br />
      StrCmp $R3 0 +3 <br />
        Goto +2 <br />
        ; else <br />
        MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Can't find .NET!&quot; <br />
        ...<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
to install .NET framework you should use ExecWait, cause it waits until the called application finished, alternative you can call it after your last dialog to install if necessary<br />
<br />
ExecWait:<br />
    ExecWait '&quot;C:\path\framework.exe&quot; (/parameters)'<br />
    first you write the path of the file you wanna use, <br />
    and after this you set parameters you maybe need<br />
<br />
(You can find more Examples in NSIS\Examples\  as the name says)<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />
<br />

<br />
You should also be careful to install the .NET Framework that matches the INSTALLED locale version of the Operating System. You should obtain the framework from the appropriate link. I have listed a few of these below. If you do not adhere to this, you could make your clients system unstable.<br />
<br />
; .NET Framework<br />
;English<br />
!define URL_DOTNET_1033 &quot;http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/a/c/aac39226-8825-44ce-90e3-bf8203e74006/dotnetfx.exe&quot;<br />

<br />
See the Microsoft Download page for the framework, select the disered language and view the source and scan it for the download link if you need a language that I have not provided above.<br />

<br />
This is my .onInit function:<br />
Function .onInit<br />
  ; check for .NET<br />
  Call IsDotNETInstalled<br />
    Pop $R3<br />
    StrCmp $R3 0 not_found found<br />
    found:<br />
        goto end<br />
    not_found:<br />
        MessageBox MB_OKCANCEL &quot;GLS has detected that you do not have Microsoft .NET Framework Installed.\r\n Press OK to install .NET Framework.&quot;<br />
        pop $R0<br />
        StrCmp $R0 IDOK installNET<br />
        Abort<br />
        installNET:<br />
            SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
            SetOverwrite ifnewer<br />
            File &quot;dotnetfx.exe&quot;<br />
            ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\dotnetfx.exe&quot;'<br />
    end:<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
When I run my installer on a computer w/o .NET, it detects that it's not there properly. Then the msg box comes up, but when I press &quot;OK&quot; nothing seems to happen. It did not start the .NET install. What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

I have attached a modified version of your script that will give you the functionality you asked for, However, I strongly advise that you read my Archive document (Follow the link above), to see how this should be done properly in a multi lingual install.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: You had it in an endless loop, and were never actually checking the registry to see if .Net was installed.<br />
<br />

I was actually trying to edit or remove my post when you were posting your reply!  I'll blame that one on me being just completely out of whack.  I restarted/organized my script and I'm gonna take it one step at a time.  I'm now looking more indepth to your documentation and getting overwhelmed already, but I will endure.  heh Thanks again for the help!<br />

The dotnetfx.exe you install has to be the same language as the os you are installing it on right?<br />
But like I interpret your code, you let the user select a language... What if that isn't the right one?<br />
Isn't there a way to determine the OS language and not let the user select it?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

Actually, It does interpret the OS you are running on, and installs the appropriate dotnet executable no matter what language you choose to install the application in.<br />

<br />
Can you please shed some light on this please, because I realy don't see it.<br />
What I see in your .OnInit function is the following line:<br />
<br />
StrCpy $URL_DOTNET &quot;${URL_DOTNET_1033}&quot;<br />
<br />
But that's the only place where $URL_DOTNET is assigned and this looks quite &quot;hard coded&quot; to me...<br />
Or am I missing something?<br />
Where is the logic which determines the os language, and assigns the $URL_DOTNET accordingly?<br />
<br />

There used to be a complete example in the archive, but they've changed so much on this site, that I can't find it. I went and looked at my post, the one you are asking about. It looks like a piece of it may be missing. I noticed some of my files had been altered as well. <br />
<br />
I currently don't have the code on this machine. But, I can tell you the code you are looking for was in an override of the .GUIInit function, which I had called MyGUIINit. Basically you check in this override for the variable you populated in the .oninit ($OSLANGUAGE) then StrCpy the appropriate URL into the URL_DOTNET variable. The initial assignment you are seeing is just a default initialization.<br />
<br />
I will see if I can find a copy of my old example, and post the block in the thread. Finding it, may take a while, and I won't be able to post it until 8pm EST. (Currently (1pm EST).<br />
<br />
