<br />
Within one of the sections of my install script, I call ExecWait to execute/launche a little java app, that sets up a user preference file based on a selection that the user has made from the app.  When I try to run the installer - nothing happens, that is my little java app does not appear.  The installer properly installs everything else thats needs but does not display the app.  I know that the installer is executing the ExecWait, however, I do not know why my app is not showing up.  I've tried hiding the installer but still my app is not visible.  Any suggestions as to what I could be doing wrong??</div></div><hr />

If nothing is happening when you call execwait then execwait is failing.  This is generally because of a bad path in your string.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your suggestion.<br />
<br />
I used the MessageBox and set the text to be displayed.  The path is correct.  I executed it in a command window and it worked - the app was launched.  Next, I created a shortcut and tried to Exec and ExecWait the shortcut, still no luck.  I can run the shortcut if I double click on it and have my app display, however, I still can not get the app to be displayed using Exec or ExecWait for either the text I specify or through a shortcut.</div></div><hr />

In this case you need to set the current directory to the class file directory. To do this read this post (it is a work around):<br />
