<br />
1. I went through the FAQ and the archives, and found exemples on how to build a small, through-the-web installer to fetch the VB runtime from the web:<br />
<br />
ExecShell &quot;open&quot; &quot;http://www.whatever.com/downloadthis.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
=&gt; How reliable is this? As I'm just starting with NSIS, does someone have a full script to install the VB runtime trough the web?<br />
<br />
2. I'd like to write a routine in Sub Main() that will <br />
- query a web app for all the dependencies for a given app (eg. www.acme.com/list.php?app=myapp -&gt; get CSV-formatted list)<br />
- for each and every dependendy, check that it's already installed<br />
- if not, fetch it from the web<br />
<br />
=&gt; Can I use nsisdl.dll to perform this task from a VB app? Does someone have an example?<br />
<br />
Thank you, and a happy new year<br />
JD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. It's reliable. :D<br />
You'll have to use NSISdl for that... The Nsis Web archive has cool examples.<br />
<br />
2. NSIS' Function .onInit is like VB's Form_Load() or Sub Main(). But NSIS is nothing like VB; although both are programming languages and have the same logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">1st January 2004, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't rely on ExecShell. You can't wait for it like you can with ExecWait and nothing assures you the user hasn't set http:// handling to a browser that will allow the user to open the file. For example, Mozilla browsers just offer to save EXE somewhere for security reasons, at least the last time I use Mozilla.<br />
<br />
As for the CSV file, I think an INI file would be simpler to manage. Instead of opening and parsing the file you'll only need to call ReadINIStr.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks but... can I use nsisdl.dll from VB to automate the whole dependency check + download part instead of reinventing the wheel? Anybody has the DECLARE required to call it from VB?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
JD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">1st January 2004, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it'd be easy to use NSISdl in VB. It would probably be easy to call a NSIS installer which will call NSISdl or just download using VB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">1st January 2004, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also check the dependencies using NSIS. See the users manual for information about commands to check DLL versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">janedoe2003</div><div class="date">1st January 2004, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting... I hadn't thought about building an installer that could be called either explicitely for the initial install, or silently every time my app starts to delegate the checking + downloading of missing components or updates.<br />
<br />
I'll see what I can do. Thanks :-)<br />
