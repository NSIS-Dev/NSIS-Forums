<br />
Yes, but that is a dialog, not a MessageBox.  Only plain text and line breaks are allowed in a MessageBox.  A dialog is owner-drawn which gives you control over all of the elements, while a messageBox only lets you set the title, text, and the icon displayed.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing stopping you replacing the call to MessageBox with your own dialog.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but it is quite a lot of work and extra overhead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, there is no detection of hyperlinks inside of rtf files for the license data for a7.  I'm not sure that this was requested or if its possible or needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th August 2002, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you talking about? Hyper links are still detected in the license page in a7 and this was never broken. E-Mails are only detected if they have mailto: before them, that's how Windows does it.<br />
<br />
It doesn't work on Windows 98 becuase for some weird reason it always loads the old RichEdit control, even though Windows 98 should have version 2.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise there are some text editors which have htpp:// dectection working, can't you work a code for the licence window in order to make this possible for all Windows build ?<br />
One more thing... I have tested with a .rtf file containing an hyperlink : the link is displayed in blue but no way to activate it<br />

And yet again we encounter the great, enriched, content filled, not an inch from the truth documentation of Microsoft...<br />
<br />
Would you mind searching for RichEd20.dll on your Windows 98 machine and tell me if you can find it?</div></div><hr />

Seems like Windows 98 want you to specifically say you want v2 unlike others that just assume. I will try to find the best solution that will make it work on all OSes, including 95 (without hyper links because it doesn't v2).</div></div><hr />

The v2 dll is often installed by other software on Windows 95. So you should check for v2, even on Win95.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyz</div><div class="date">2nd September 2002, 00:03</div></div><div class="posttext">There are also mutiple versions of riched20.dll. On my system I found the following versions :<br />
* 5.0.153.0 (version 5)<br />
* 5.30.23.1200 (version 3)<br />
* 5.40.11.2210 (version 4)<br />
And one may have installed by my text editor which higlight URLs : ConTEXT (http://www.fixedsys.com/context/ ).<br />
So it seems you can make it available for any Win OS...<br />

What exactly did you test?  NSIS 1.x doesn't use the richedit control at all.</div></div><hr />

If you are using a UI.exe, be sure to get latest (I updated modern.exe, modern2.exe, and default.exe) .. If it still doesnt work let me know.<br />

Thx for the reply, I didn't think I needed to update modern.exe (the UI I use)<br />
