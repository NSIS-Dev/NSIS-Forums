<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">27th February 2006, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that the following scenario skipped my file extraction if that file did not exist on the destination machine:<br />
<br />
SetOverWrite ifnewer<br />
GetTempFileName $1 $OUTDIR<br />
File &quot;/oname=$1&quot; &quot;poo.exe&quot;<br />
Rename /REBOOTOK &quot;$1&quot; &quot;poo.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
My guess was that since $1 here is a .tmp file, the File command didn't like trying to extract version information from it to compare to poo.exe, since SetOverWrite was set to ifnewer. So I tried the following workaround, which works for me:<br />
<br />
SetOverWrite ifnewer<br />
GetTempFileName $1 $OUTDIR<br />
Rename $1 &quot;$1.exe&quot;<br />
File &quot;/oname=$1&quot; &quot;poo.exe&quot;<br />
Rename /REBOOTOK &quot;$1&quot; &quot;poo.exe&quot;<br />
Delete &quot;$1.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Am I correct as to why this happened? If so, are there other commands that will not work as expected with .tmp files?</div></div><hr />

Guess I'll have to use an extra step for version comparison.</div></div><hr />
