<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">5th May 2006, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am not sure if I have to provide the language files saved with the correct codepage (as seems to be the ones from C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files) or is it ok if I provide just an UTF-8 file.<br />
<br />
In order to test this I tried to use the C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\Arabic.nsh as this one is supposed to be saved in the correct form.<br />
<br />
So steps I did:<br />
<br />
- Create a very simple installer<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot;<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Arabic&quot;<br />
!include &quot;Arabic.nsh&quot;<br />
...<br />
Function .onInit<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />
<br />
    StrCpy $msg &quot;${MUI_TEXT_LICENSE_TITLE}&quot;<br />
    MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_OK &quot;$msg&quot;<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
- and as I couldn't use the Arabic.nsh as it's by default provided, I opened it with VC++ editor, deleted all the lines except:<br />
<br />
<br />
  !define MUI_TEXT_LICENSE_TITLE &quot;***1573;***1578;***1601;***1575;***1602;***1610;***1577;***8207; ***1575;***1604;***1578;***1585;***1582;***1610;***1589;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
and then just save it.<br />
<br />
Problem is, when I run the installer I am not able to see the right chars. All I see are &quot;monkeys&quot;. Please see the attached files: momo.nsi and Arabic.nsh.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
1) Can you pls tell me what am I doing wrong above?<br />
2) Can smbd pls give me an arabic.nsh with just one correct define?<br />
3) Once I have the above I'll keep trying, with and without UTF-8, but still I can ask: can I provide the language files saved in UTF-8 format? or do I have to provide the file in the correct codepage? (pls note that I'm not familiar with codepage and languages)<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">5th May 2006, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems I am really lost. I tried the sample written in my first entry, and not only my custom string looks fishy, but also the NSIS default dialogs look weird.<br />
<br />
I have the right languages installed (Arabic) so I really don't understand what's the issue.<br />
<br />
Please see in the attached file:<br />
- the script I was playing with<br />
- that I have the right language installed<br />
- how the NSIS built-in dialog in Arabic looks on my system (I have Win 2000 English installed).<br />
<br />
Can someone pls tell me what am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">5th May 2006, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, after trying everything around I finally got the point so I will post the answers to my own questions:<br />
<br />
1) In order to see NSIS Arabic dialogs it's needed to set the corect codepage (on Win 2000: Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Regional Options -&gt; Set Default -&gt; choose an Arabic). Once this is set I can see correct both: my dialog and the NSIS dialogs.<br />
<br />
2) My second post contains a correct Arabic.nsh with only one define.<br />
<br />
3) No, using utf-8 language files won't work. The language files _have_ to be saved with the correct codepage. iconv is a tool that can be used for this.<br />
<br />
If the above is not OK pls correct me.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th May 2006, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You're correct. By the way, there's a valid Arabic NSH file in Contrib\Modern UI\Languge files\Arabic.nsh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">8th May 2006, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx kichik for the answer, but as I wrote above that Arabic.nsh file couldn't just be added to a project as contains more than just some defines, this is why out of that file I was trying to create a small version with only one define.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">8th May 2006, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">One more question related to the language subject: is there a way to prevent the user to choose a language for the installer that is not supported by the current codepage? I mean let's say I have in my installer the following languages: english, german, arabic, so when a user starts the installer he can select any of these 3 languages regardless of it's codepage. So if the user has an english system and he chooses arabic he will see just &quot;monkeys&quot;. Can I somehow make so that in the language-dialog-selection are shown only the languages that fit the codepage of the user? (in the sample above to show english and german and not also arabic)<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
Viv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th May 2006, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">You can call GetACP (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_21bk.asp?frame=true) using the System plug-in and compare the result to that of the languages. You can then push to LangDLL just the supported languages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">9th May 2006, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Wouldn't it be a decent requirement for some feature version of NSIS this to be somehow done by default? I mean doesn't make any sense on an english codepage to even let the user choose arabic. He'll just complain afterwards :)<br />
