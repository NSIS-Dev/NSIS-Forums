<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TelePlus</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been tasked with learning how to use NSIS to package and push out our software.  I've spent the past couple of days installing the package, reading the manual, fiddling, and poking around this message board.  Slowly, I'm starting to learn it.<br />
<br />
However, one thing I'm trying to figure out how to do, I haven't found notice of, as yet, and I'm hoping one of you might tell me what I'm missing.<br />
<br />
We're building an installation package to put our software onto a client's machine.  I'm beginning to understand the steps I need to position and place our own software; that's not a problem.  However, our software also requires that the client may or may not need to install a set of ODBC drivers, a compiler, a database, and possibly a couple of other things.  Now, if we were to be providing those items, there appears to be no problem.  However, we aren't.  The ODBC drivers come from one company, the compiler from another, the database from a third.<br />
<br />
Is there a way for me to automatically script things such that, after telling the installation package where to put *our* software, it can then ask where to put the ODBC driver (yes, I found the discussion &quot;Different InstallDirs&quot;, 2002/11/04) and subsequently walk the ODBC driver through it's own script (InstallShield, I believe), providing the responses to it's asking for EULA acceptance, where to put the material, and entering the (hardcoded) serial number?  Also, of course, acting in the same fashion for the compiler and the database?<br />
<br />
With all of the reading I've done for the past couple of days, I've not found any method of doing so, and I'm hoping that it's just something I've overlooked.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read this.</div></div><hr />

This will cause them to run silently and allow you to show whatever dialogs required in your own installer.</div></div><hr />

I'm now looking around to find how to provide such a text file.  I noticed that Glimpse said he found how to control an Installshield product with such a file; I just need to find out where he found the information.</div></div><hr />
