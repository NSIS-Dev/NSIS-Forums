<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hooklee</div><div class="date">25th May 2005, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">ClearErrors<br />
 CopyFiles C:\dir1\*.* C:\dir2<br />
 IfErrors 0 +2<br />
 MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Error or cancelled!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Running the above code with a large numer of files (about 600MB in my test), NSIS cannot catch the event if the user clicks &quot;Cancel&quot; button quickly after the copying dialog appears. If the user clicks the &quot;Cancel&quot; button after a few minutes, NSIS can successfully catch the event and popup the message box.<br />
<br />
The problem seems related to the not-very-short preparation stage of the long copying operation. Is it a bug of NSIS or Windows? Any solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">25th May 2005, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the installers I wrote also use similar logic to detect if somebody hit the Cancel button.  I rarely copy more than a few files at a time though so I couldn't reproduce the bug with my real scripts.  I did however change my script to copy a large folder with lots of files (i.e. c:\windows) and then I could reproduce the error every time.  I don't have any suggestions for you but just wanted to let you know that the preparation stage is most likely the culprit like you said.  If only there was a way to hide or disable the Cancel button.  I also wish you could alter the text that displays during the Windows copy dialog.</div></div><hr />
