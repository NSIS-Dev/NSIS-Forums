<br />
First, i want to say that I'm french so excuse my bad english :)<br />
Secondly, it's the first time I use this programmation language so I'm not a rookie :)<br />
<br />
This is my problem.<br />
<br />
I have founded a little program that donwload the latest version of chromium (here (http://mulder.dummwiedeutsch.de/home/?page=projects#chromium) )<br />
<br />
I wanted to change the open source to do the same with firefox. Unfortunately, errors appear during the nsi compilation, even when I compile before any changes !<br />
The first error is the &quot;update.ico&quot; file missing; easy to resolve by deleting the call string.<br />
But the second error is more sneaky. Error line 257: Error in macro __Download on macroline 8<br />
<br />
I don't understand this language but he is apparently simple. I have looked, &quot;__Download&quot; return 4 arguments, there is no syntax error...<br />
I don't see where is the problem.<br />
Can you help me please ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first error is the &quot;update.ico&quot; file missing; easy to resolve by deleting the call string.What call string?<br />
What for do you need the icon?<br />
<br />
But the second error is more sneaky. Error line 257: Error in macro __Download on macroline 8It would be great, if you could post the code of the macro. Then we can have a look on line 8. ;-)<br />

Here is the original code.<br />
<br />
When I compile it, I got the first error at line 23:<br />
Icon &quot;Update.ico&quot;<br />
so I deleted this line.<br />
<br />
The second error is at line 256.<br />
<br />
And thank you for helping me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChocJunkie</div><div class="date">21st October 2009, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the problem using the icon is, you've specified a (incorrect) absolute path. I've got no doubt, you dont have a file with the absolute path &quot;Update.ico&quot;.<br />
To solve the problem you can use a relative path that describes where your icon lies in relation to your installer. Example: If your icon is stored in the same directory as your installer, the path would be &quot;.\Update.ico&quot;.<br />
You can also pass the absolute path of the icon. That can be for example &quot;C:\MyDir\Update.icon&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I can't see the error in macro __Download right now... <br />
I've tried it in a shorter version and for me it's fine.<br />

<br />
For the other error, loon at the picture...<br />

<br />
Maybe it is a software version problem...</div></div><hr />

He says: &quot;Invalid command: inetc::get&quot;. So, you're simply missing the include of the inetc plugin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rhazerty</div><div class="date">21st October 2009, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">YEAAAAH !<br />
<br />
I understand now !<br />
<br />
I got 2 others errors but easy to fix thanks to your help:<br />
1) missing inetc plugin<br />
2) unable to find unzip.exe (to make an installer)<br />
3) missing LockedList plugin<br />
<br />
All resolved with google and you !<br />
<br />
Thank you !<br />
<br />
PS: where do I make this thread solved ?</div></div><hr />
