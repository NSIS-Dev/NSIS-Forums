<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">14th June 2002, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">i want to use a single binary for both normal and silent installs.  my plan was to use cmdline/getparameters to check for the commandline argument '-silent', and if that was set to give the appropriate value to silentinstall and silentuninstall.<br />
<br />
due to the limitation of being unable to call the function and pop the variable out in the begninning 'non-section', and the limitation of being unable to set installation flags in the first section, i'm wondering if this is possible at all.<br />
<br />
can i test for this flag's setting throughout the would-be interactive parts of my installation and still be able to pull of an interactive as well as a 'double click and it's installed with no prompts' silent install?</div></div><hr />

I judge this as a crosspost! Let this be a warning!<br />
The answer has already been supplied here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=90819).<br />
<br />
To summarize: /S is available for all (un)installers. You do not need to program it. Just put it at the command line and the installer will be silent (apart from MessageBoxes).<br />
<br />
Use the function GetParameters (functions.htm) or GetNextParm (http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15) to check if /S has indeed been supplied. Set a user variable to 1 if and 0 otherwise. Use this to test (StrCmp) if you need to display MessageBoxes or not.<br />

<br />
i didn't realize the s was case-sensitive - i tried that using /s instead of /S and it failed<br />
<br />
this solution works now, thanks</div></div><hr />
