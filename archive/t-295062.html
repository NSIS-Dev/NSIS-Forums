<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joeysr20det</div><div class="date">25th July 2008, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using the basic MUI sample script. I've added before the !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH, !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN C:\viewer.exe to display the &quot;Run this program&quot; check box. The weird part is, anytime i use a checkbox on that page the title on the finish page flickers in and out due to an obvious paint problem. Is this a known issue? I switched to the latest build 2.38, after experiencing the problems on 2.37. I've attached the script I'm using.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It works as described on multiple machines configured differently here. You do have to allow up to 45 seconds sometimes for it to happen. This problem also seems to exist in your installer nsis-2.38-setup.exe for your latest build. On the last page with the launch and readme check boxes.<br />
<br />
I know it seems odd, but it seems odd to me that this happens on two completely different machines, one running a quad core Intel with a 64 bit version of Windows 2003 Service Pack 2 and no apps or custom configs, and my main development machine, a Quad core AMD running a 32 bit version of Windows 2003 Service Pack 2 with numerous development applications and custom configurations.</div></div><hr />
