<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moose517</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 04:15</div></div><div class="posttext">i have read throug the example on embedding installers in NSIS but i can't get the directx runtime to work correctly.  I have all the files needed for it in a folder called redist and the setup file is in that folder  I want to install it silently as well without user interference.  Here is what i have maybe someone could suggest something to get it to run right, i see what the installer pops up and then goes away real quick before the user has the chance to install in a non silent way but i want it done silently if possible.  And also the shortcut to the start menu will not delete either with this.  Thanks for you help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moose517</div><div class="date">18th July 2008, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry if i sounded rude, i just though the thread had dropped enough to try and get it back to the top to see if anyone had a solution.  I tried doing what is described in the first link with the requestexectutionLevel but now when i install it the start menu files fail to be created or deleted.  And one more question, i can't get the registry write to work to be able to use the add/remove programs, i followed the example in the documentation to a T and it don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moose517</div><div class="date">18th July 2008, 00:46</div></div><div class="posttext">NVM, i got it, thanks for your help any ways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moose517</div><div class="date">19th July 2008, 03:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so i thought that i had it, i ran it on an older computer and apparantly it didn't install the dx runtime, do i need to include all the cab files and dlls that are listed in the nsi file for it to be able to install them correctly? grr i thought creating a installer would be easy not hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">19th July 2008, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Just extract all the required files to $PLUGINSDIR and then run the main executable/msi with the correct switches to make it run silent. What could be easier?<br />
<br />
InitPluginsDir<br />
SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
File ...<br />
File ...<br />
ExecWait `&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\...&quot; ...` $R0<br />
${If} $R0 != 0<br />
