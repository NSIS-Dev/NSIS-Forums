<br />
I love Nullsoft for such a great code,<br />
<br />
just downloaded the Nullsoft Install System a few days ago<br />
and created all the install features I wanted and much more...<br />
<br />
It took me some time though, thus why I would like 2 share this<br />
script I made of a modern-UI, which has some more features<br />
<br />
1. It's working (and does not suck)<br />
2. It's beautiful<br />
3. I'm beautiful<br />
4. I writes down the Add/Remove Data<br />
5. It creates Shortcuts on desktop &amp; start menu<br />
6. I added some cool abort questions<br />
7. it can detect if already installed &amp; allow U 2 uninstall<br />
8. it can identify Product Version and compare with current<br />
9. it will kill the running application when needed<br />
<br />
+ more stuff...<br />
<br />
I guess it's good if U want 2 have a fast working hot looking installer<br />
with no time and you R 2 moron 2 figure this out yourself...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure 2 modify these:<br />
<br />
VER_MAJOR<br />
VER_MINOR<br />
VER_RELEASE<br />
VER_BUILD<br />
<br />
strAppShortName<br />
strAppLongName<br />
strCompanyName<br />
strTempFileName<br />
strUninstallFileName<br />
<br />
MUI_PRODUCT<br />
MUI_VERSION<br />
APP_TITLE<br />
MUI_BRANDINGTEXT<br />
<br />
strDirRelease<br />
strDirResource<br />
<br />
<br />
don't U just love forums ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">13th May 2003, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks fine to me.<br />
I attach an screenshot of the Start menu program.<br />
<br />
Is that what you want?<br />
<br />
I mean the shortcut icon of your EULA is for an EXE,<br />
that will confuse somo users.<br />
<br />
OH!<br />
<br />
And why no use:<br />
<br />
<br />
RMDir /r $INSTDIR<br />
<br />
<br />
To remove the hole Installation dir including the files on it<br />
<br />
instead of using &quot;Delete&quot; to many times.<br />
<br />
Cool dude :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, U R right - it's not my real exe<br />
(coz I can't release it yet)<br />
so it does not have the correct icon resource from the exe file, 1<br />
<br />
about RMDir - it may delete some other links or stuff the user put<br />
in that dir (I think) and I don't like to kill his stuff...<br />
<br />
10X 4 your comments and 4 your real great help on this,</div></div><hr />

i'm missing a screenshot  <br />
<br />
<br />
Download it,<br />
Compile it<br />
And have a look on the real thing.<br />
<br />
(I try 2 add the exe file - but it exceeds the upload limit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">i looked at the attached .exe files, but they don't show much. would like to see some action.<br />

additionally i was wondering if you were interested in creating another ui. i'd love to present you a gui, put together in photoshop. was looking for someone to realize it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
U need 2 compile it using the NSIS compiler to get an exe file,<br />
(or send me an e-mail and I'll reply with the exe attached)<br />
<br />
about the graphic GUI - I was thinking about it 2,<br />
it can also B a non rectangular shape (like a skin)<br />
but this may involve a creation of a new modern-UI dialog<br />
that the script will use, I'm not sure if it's such a good idea<br />
(in my case I like 2 maintain a small &amp; reliable installer)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think U can use &quot;Splash&quot; (in the Contrib dir) to do it,<br />
and also play some sounds...<br />
<br />
+<br />
If U want post or send me your UI screen shot</div></div><hr />
