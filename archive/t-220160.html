<br />
i'm in the process to find a way to create an installer for Terminal Servers. Problem seems to be, that %WINDIR and %FONTS  Constants are not containing the System folders like<br />
<br />
C:\WINDOWS and C:\WINDOWS\FONTS.<br />
<br />
On a terminal Server i get the personal folders<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Windows ..<br />
<br />
I also have tried a call of Kernel32::GetWindowsDirectory<br />
<br />
only kernel32::GetSystemWindowsDirectoryA<br />
<br />
gives me the correct C:\WINDOWS\System32..<br />
<br />
I also found some articles on MSDN.. and a File Header problem that have to be set.. <br />
<br />
IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_TERMINAL_SERVER_AWARE<br />
<br />
I never heard about this before.. but it seems to be important in a Terminal Server environment?<br />
<br />
Can someone help me? How can i get the Windows Folder on a Terminal Server correctly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the usual terminal-server behaviour.<br />
<br />
Terminal-server is an approach to use windows as a multi-user system: If an application writes to an ini-file which is located in the windows-folder, windows writes it to the %userprofile%\windows folder. If it would not do this, there would soon be a giant mess because every user writes to the same ini-file.<br />
<br />
When you start a setup-routine on a terminal server and this program is named setup.exe, windows says that you should install in &quot;install-mode&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe your install file is not named setup.exe, so you could execute the command &quot;change user /install&quot; before you start and &quot;change user /execute&quot; after installation.<br />
<br />
You can get further information in the help files of windows.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.<br />
-Bruno.</div></div><hr />

This works. I also have searched for this at MSDN now.. and found it. (Only with your information)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for this quick respond.<br />
<br />
Now my installer works fine on a Terminal Server! :-))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">30th June 2005, 06:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe a good feature request for NSIS would be to have a installer attribute named TerminalServerAware which could be set to &quot;yes&quot; in order to have the IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_TERMINAL_SERVER_AWARE flag in the generated EXE header.</div></div><hr />
