<br />
If their was such a DLL then of course I could ask them for the ifo, and store it in the reg or an INI file, but I ahvent seen anything that can do hashing yet for NSIS.<br />
<br />
On another note, is their a way I can get TODAY's date from the computer I'm working on, for creating demo versions of my packages, that timebomb in 30 days or something.<br />
<br />
Nevermind about the date thingy, just found NSISdt in the Archive:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/download.php<br />
<br />
I know it's not really in the spirit of free software, but its what I'm being asked to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps someone could show an example of how to use system::call ...with this DLL to get the hash of a string (there is a readme and VB BAS file in the zip).<br />
<br />
Can't get my head around that system thingy at all...LOL<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simham_uk</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I intend to do, but ask that they enter their name and a lincense key, then store that info in an INI file or the registry, and then query the name against the license key everytime it is run.<br />
<br />
This way I can add &quot;salt&quot; to the string and generate license keys for use in distribution.<br />
<br />
Unless you have a way to do this without the need for an external hashing DLL?<br />
<br />
Thanks for you input!</div></div><hr />
