<br />
PLEASE, READ THIS. I think it's relevant.<br />
<br />
Well, I have not good news.<br />
In fact, a simple script that keeps running background,<br />
after about one hour, starts to crash Win98.<br />
Today, I was listening to a lot of music in Winamp, <br />
when Winamp crashes again . Then, I remembered that<br />
Winamp ALWAYS crashes (itself) after some time, and today,<br />
it happened about two hours after started.<br />
I also remembered that Winamp ALWAYS crashes after some time<br />
since version 3 (I posted it in this forum a long time ago, when I was using a 586, 166MHz).<br />
<br />
I'm not a developer and want only to help us.<br />
For me, looks like there is something not right in the<br />
structure of Winamp/Nsis.<br />
<br />
Winamp v2.x and mediaPlayer (audio-video) don't show problems<br />
Winamp also frequently stops for a long time or crashes itself when STARTS to read cda. So serious that I don't use Winamp for cda.<br />
BTW, the only app that crashes W98 that I can remember is 1By1 ( a micro-player free), but can be in few minutes or many hours. No problems with other timers or shedulers.<br />
<br />
After all these days, I noticed that the first problem that shows that Win will crash is when a file is not opened by its .exe in Explorer. Then, fastly close my nsis app and Win becomes normal. (my timer or my clipboard monitor).<br />
<br />
Thank you for all.</div></div><hr />
