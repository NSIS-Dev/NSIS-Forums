<br />
If anyone can help, I would appreciate it.  I recently compiled an installer successfully using NSIS.  It is a setup file that installs alot of data.  The setup file came out to be around 980MB and when uncompressed, it requires about 11.5 GB of space.<br />
<br />
I went back and added just a few more files to the folders that I am compressing in the install, and now when it gets to the end when compiling, I am getting this error:<br />
<br />
Error: can't write 62968023 bytes to output<br />
Error - aborting creation process<br />
<br />
here also is what else is printed right before it fails:<br />
<br />
Processed 1 file, 1 command line command, writing output:<br />
Adding plug-ins initializing function... Done!<br />
warning: Uninstall section found but WriteUninstaller never used - no uninstaller will be created.<br />

Error - aborting creation process<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me why adding just a few more files that are most likely under 2MB worth of data would now cause this problem? or is it unrelated?<br />
<br />
it sounds like a memory or HD space issue, but I think I have enough space... maybe not enough memory?  it worked before..... arg.<br />
<br />
thanks for any help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th November 2005, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly you need WriteUninstaller in an install Section to create your uninstall.exe.<br />
That won't fix your problem though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CGTV</div><div class="date">18th November 2005, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the response... Yes I'm quite aware of the uninstall issue - I purposely left that out because I dont want to make an uninstaller now, so I commented out that stuff... but that has nothing to do with the problem.<br />
<br />
Can someone else address the issue that I asked about?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

I'd recommend at least 1GB-1.5GB before compiling an installer that huge. and 1.5-2GB if you're using Windows Vista ÃŸ1.  Also it very well could be a HDD space issue.  NSIS uses a lot of temporary space on the disk when it's compiling, so you want at least 15GB free, or 20GB for Vista ÃŸ1.<br />

Not sure if you hit the limit for installer size.  That could be the problem, though you should be able to create setups as big as 2GB in Win2000/XP/2003/Vista<br />

<br />
I freed up some extra HD space and also setup larger Virtual Memory disks on the HD partitions and it finally worked.<br />
<br />
My system is Win2K and only has 512MB RAM, so I must have been pushing the limits.<br />
<br />
but it works now, so if anyone has this issue try increasing the HD space and Virtual Memory.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
