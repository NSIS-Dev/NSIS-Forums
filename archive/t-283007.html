<br />
I would like to know how (or if it is at all possible) to force a static text control to be antialiased using ClearType under WinXP and up.<br />
<br />
In C I'd do something like:<br />
<br />
LOGFONT MyLogFont;<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
MyLogFont.lfQuality = CLEARTYPE_QUALITY;<br />
<br />
But how would I be able to do the same thing using NSIS? Could I use the font handle from a CreateFont command for something?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Brad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has been over a couple of months since I posted about this, but am still having immense trouble getting anything close to working. Not wanting to write a plugin, I'm wanting to create my own font handle using the System plugin to do what this C code does:<br />
<br />
LOGFONT lf;<br />
memset(&amp;lf, 0, sizeof(lf));<br />
lf.lfQuality = CLEARTYPE_QUALITY;<br />
lf.lfHeight = -32;<br />
strcpy(lf.lfFaceName, &quot;Verdana&quot;);<br />
HFONT hFont = CreateFontIndirect(&amp;lf); <br />
<br />
Is there any possiblity that someone could please provide an example on how to do this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Brad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bradharding</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">It's mainly for the welcome page and header texts that lay over bitmaps, that would look so much better anti-aliased. (And the text of course is dynamic, so that's why I haven't done the obvious by making the text part of the bitmap.)<br />
<br />
Your expertise would be greatly appreciated! ;)</div></div><hr />

Thanks again, Anders! NSIS wouldn't be what it is without the outstanding support from people such as yourself! :D</div></div><hr />
