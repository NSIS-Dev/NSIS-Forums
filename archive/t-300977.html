<br />
Unfortunately there is very little in this forum regarding anything to do with Adobe AIR.<br />
<br />
Has anybody managed to install AIR silently? That's to say no dialogs whatsoever.<br />
<br />
According to Adobe's website they say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Silent installation is supported only as part of redistribution. Note that redistributing AIR also requires signing a separate license.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, I would like to do a silent install for an in house demonstration only, I've tried executing the AdobeAIRInstaller.exe with the /quiet flag, it seemed like it was doing something as there was a delay, however nothing was installed.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

You'll have to figure out how to trick each and every one of them to install silently, or simply mimic the installation process yourself. There are some tools available that follow the installation process for you and give you a report of installed files and registry entries, so you can create your own installer.</div></div><hr />
