<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dick4</div><div class="date">31st March 2002, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I've written a vbscript to create NSIS installers based off of some already created .nsi scripts.  The vbscript simply copies a file, dumps it in a directory and then NSIS makes the installer for that one file.  It works great currently, however I'd like the .nsi to be able to generate a dynamic name, is this possible?  If not through NSIS, I think I can get the vbscript to simply edit the .nsi and give it the name I want, but it would be a lot easier on me if NSIS could do it. :D <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and BIG THANKS to Nullsoft for NSIS, it has saved me and the company I work for hours and hours of time and money.</div></div><hr />

Not possible with NSIS right now (as far as I know), so you should do it with vbscript.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">31st March 2002, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand you correctly it is possible.<br />
Just use:<br />
File /oname=dynamicName.ext yourfile.ext<br />
This will output the file with a different name (in this example dynamicName.ext) and you can make it dynamic (using processed strings).<br />
<br />
If you want the installer file to get a dynamic name just edit (with the vbscript) your &quot;OutFile installer.exe&quot; line.<br />
<br />

<br />
(edit) An easier way would be:<br />
OutFile ${INSTALLERNAME}<br />
<br />
and then calling makensis with this switch: /DINSTALLERNAME=whatever.exe <br />
<br />
You can do the same with File /oname=${INSTALLERNAME} of course...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm probly going to do I think is make the installer make the same filename every time (bob.exe or whatever) and then simply rename it as I copy it in my vbscript (mary.exe, jane.exe, etc).<br />
<br />
*edit* ok, so I reread your post and it makes more sense.  I can name a variable in my nsis script and pass the value of it through the command line?  Cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">1st April 2002, 02:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this:<br />
<br />
makensis filename.nsi &quot;/XOutFile myfile.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
The last command will override the output file to myfile.exe<br />
<br />

<br />
Thx Justin.<br />
