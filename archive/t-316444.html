<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lerklompen</div><div class="date">21st January 2010, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">when running the installed program upon finish in combination with requesting application privileges as admin:<br />
- if a &quot;user&quot; is trying to install, he/she must choose one of the &quot;admin&quot; user accounts to be able to install.<br />
- the password for this admin user must be filled in to allow the install procedure.<br />
- upon finishing the installation the installed program is started:<br />
this process is actually started as the admin user, but running on the logged on user's desktop!<br />
if the application has any kind of file dialogs (open, save as, etc.) this &quot;user&quot; is now able to browse, alter, delete, all of this admin user's files!<br />
<br />
this &quot;bug&quot; or what to call it, is fairly common among many installers, but it would be nice to be able to avoid it.<br />
<br />
is there any workaround? that is; let the installer start the program upon finish, but as the user logged on, not as the admin running the installation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">21st January 2010, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Two solutions exist for NSIS:<br />
1) Remove the Run Application checkbox from your finish page. This is the simple solution.<br />
2) Use the UAC plugin to execute your application As User in a finishpage run-function. This is the complicated solution, and sports a much higher chance of going wrong.<br />
<br />
Option 1 is recommended. The Run checkbox is practically useless anyway.</div></div><hr />
