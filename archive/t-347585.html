<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ed benoit</div><div class="date">30th August 2012, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I am new with NSIS.  I have executed the tutorial samples and attempted to understand the process.  <br />
I have (A)  DB2 Express-C,  (2)  OOREXX, and  (3) A REXX application using OOREXX and DB2 Express_C running on a PC.  I read that DB2 Express_C has control cards that was created when I installed DB2 Express_C to be used to installed it on another PC without walking through the complete process.   I do not understand how to locate and used these control cards to pick up DB2 Express_C and install it on another PC.<br />
<br />
I would like to pick the above three up and install these in a new folder created by the installer on other PCs.<br />
Where do I start?  Point me in the right direction, User Manual (Chapter), Examples, ETC.<br />
Any exmples to start me up would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />
:o<br />
Ed.</div></div><hr />

To learn where DB2/REXX/whatever stuff is stored, you should ask that in a forum about DB2/etc. Once you know exactly what you need to do (which files or registry keys to copy, which database accesss tools to use, etc), we can help you with finding the appropriate way to do it in NSIS.</div></div><hr />
