<br />
i came across this (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=308395&amp;highlight=RunAsAdmin), not sure if this is a possible solution. anyway, i would prefer not having to use the registry for such a simple task.</div></div><hr />

I guess to Exec without Wait you can just call shellexecuteex without worrying about process handles.<br />
<br />
(I found it by using the search function. Keyword 'admin', search in titles only, show results as threads, NSIS forum only.)<br />
<br />
(Note: Running an exe As Admin will ALWAYS require the user to enter credentials. It would be bad if you could just run something as admin without the admin password!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">30th July 2011, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">so now i'm using ShellExecWait (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellExecWait) and it does the job for ExecWait.<br />
<br />
however, i looking for the same to perform a simple Exec. i commented the following portion of the code and it works as desired.<br />
<br />
${If} $1 &lt;&gt; 0<br />
	System::Call '*$0(is,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i.r1)' ;stack value not really used, just a fancy pop ;)<br />
	System::Call 'kernel32::WaitForSingleObject(ir1,i-1)'<br />
	System::Call 'kernel32::GetExitCodeProcess(ir1,*i.s)'<br />
	System::Call 'kernel32::CloseHandle(ir1)'<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
as i don't really understand this, i was wondering if there's more code i could leave?</div></div><hr />
