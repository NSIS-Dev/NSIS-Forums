<br />
I was curious since I couldn't find any previous threads about it and I've been pondering about it for awhile now (so I thought others might have too : P ).<br />
<br />
Anyway, when you start a Banner, it is ALWAYS in the exact centre of the screen. Shouldn't it be in the centre of the installer itself?<br />
<br />
Sometimes I move installers to the side so I can look at other things while it's going, and if a banner pops up, it'll most likely be behind any current windows I have open, instead of opening in the middle of the installer window that's sitting to the side.<br />
<br />
Ugh, I hope that last paragraph made some sense.<br />
<br />
Anyways, yes. Banner always loads in the centre of the screen and I think it should load in the middle of the installer's location.</div></div><hr />
