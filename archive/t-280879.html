I found someone did a /set 76 -- does this set the size?  I have a banner, but the text is getting cut-off, and I am looking for a solution (other than trimming the text).  Can I do two lines, or stretch the box a bit?<br />
<br />
Well, I managed to actually find a reference in the 2.02 release notes, and I understand what /set does, but is there a way to stretch the box or add two lines that would be great.<br />
<br />
Another  suggestion, would be to tweak the help files so when you search for banner, they link to the same page as what is in the 2.02 release notes.  It was the only link I could find.  It would probably be worthy of a paragraph to explain what it is and how it can be used.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

Open up modern.exe or default.exe in Contrib\UIs with Resource Hacker and modify dialog 111.<br />

<br />
The Banner plug-in uses the internal banner resource from your stub, so it doesn't control its size. You'll have to edit the UI with Resource Hacker in order to add more space.</div></div><hr />
