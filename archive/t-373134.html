<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vezik</div><div class="date">16th October 2013, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently trying to get my uninstaller and installer completely silent. I've managed to silence everything except for one part, the 'Uninstaller : Complete' 'Close' button. I want to somehow automatically close this window so the user will not have to see anything at all.<br />
<br />
So far I've tried:<br />
<br />
SetAutoClose true<br />
Abort<br />
SetUnInstall silent<br />
<br />
But none seem to have fixed this issue.<br />
I have a feeling that one of these instructions is correct, but I am using it incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Function un.onUninstSuccess<br />
	;-------code-------<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
This is the function that controls this action I believe. <br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

SetUnInstall doesn't exist, the compiler certainly threw you an error on that one. Maybe it's a typo and you did use SilentUnInstall. In that case, the only problem that pops to mind is that SilentUnInstall must be placed outside of functions/sections. But again, the compiler would've thrown an error and told you that.</div></div><hr />
