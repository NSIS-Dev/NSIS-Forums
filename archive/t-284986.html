<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jared.oberhaus</div><div class="date">14th January 2008, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just spent quite some time figuring out why my installer is aborting and giving me a dialog box with:<br />
<br />
&quot;Installer corrupted: invalid opcode&quot;.<br />
<br />
I couldn't find any forum posts or documentation to help me debug this, so I tracked it down, line by line in my script until I figured out which line it was. And then I guessed what the answer was. Here are the two lines that are causing me to get this error:<br />
<br />
    IfErrors 0 +2<br />
        !insertmacro LogProgressMessage '&quot;There was an error...&quot;'<br />
<br />
The intent of &quot;IfErrors 0 +2&quot; is that if there are no errors to skip over the logging message. Note that LogProgressMessage is my own macro which uses GetTime to log a message with a date and time to a log file.<br />
<br />
However, since this is a macro, not a statement, the +2 is very ineffective. In fact, I believe that when my macro is expanded out, the first statement is a &quot;Push&quot;. There is of course a corresponding Pop, but if there is no error, the Push is skipped while the Pop is not.<br />
<br />
Therefore there are three lessons here:<br />
<br />
* More Pops than Pushes will cause your installer to abort with &quot;Installer corrupted: invalid opcode&quot;.<br />
* When using the +2 mechanism to jump over statements, you must be sure that the next line is really a statement, not a macro.<br />
* In general it's much safer to use labels than to use the +2 mechanism (or any +n)</div></div><hr />

Just been going nuts for 2 hours trying to solve this.<br />
I had a pop with no offsetting push.<br />
Gaaaack!<br />
Thx for posting this.</div></div><hr />
