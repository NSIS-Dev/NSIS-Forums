<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joeyo</div><div class="date">7th January 2013, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am not sure whether this is a problem with my NSIS script or with Eclipse RCP programming part, still posting here to get some clue on my problem.<br />
Currently I am testing my Eclipse RCP appliction for Windows platform ( XP and above).<br />
<br />
I am generating HTML pages at runtime. To save these HTML pages I am also creating a folder at runtime. I am deleting the folder along with the generated html pages, the moment user exits application.<br />
<br />
The folder is created at the same level where the exe file is located. <br />
Below is the directory structure exactly how it looks:<br />
<br />
	MyApplication<br />
		|<br />
		|--MyApplication.exe<br />
		|--Myapplication.ini<br />
		|--artifacts.xml<br />
		|--uninstall.exe<br />
		|--configuration<br />
		|--p2<br />
		|--plugins<br />
		|--workspace<br />
		|--cache	(user defined folder)<br />
		     |<br />
		     |--system	(this is the runtime created folder, generated HTML pages are saved here)<br />
			   |<br />
			   |---	<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the code to create the folder at runtime:<br />
<br />
    java.lang.String currentPath=System.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;);<br />
    java.io.File folder = new java.io.File(currentPath+&quot;/cache/system&quot;);<br />
<br />
This all works fine.<br />
Now using NSIS script I have created shortcuts for the &quot;.exe&quot; at two locations- One is on user desktop and other in StartMenu.<br />
<br />
**The problem is, if I run the application from shortcut, the folder is not created.**<br />
What should be done to solve this problem?<br />
<br />
The script to create the shotcut is:<br />
<br />
    CreateShortcut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\$StartMenuGroup\MyApplication.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\MyApplication.exe&quot;<br />
    CreateShortcut &quot;$DESKTOP\MyApplication.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\MyApplication.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Any comments/suggestions/solutions are greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">7th January 2013, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Is your working dir ('start from' dir) set correctly? It's equal to the value of $INSTDIR at the time the shortcut is created, so you can use SetOutPath to change it.<br />
<br />
To debug, let your java app output the exact folder it's trying to create, to a messagebox or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joeyo</div><div class="date">11th January 2013, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is with my Java code. When I start the application from Shortcuts, the code System.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;) treats the shortcut location as the Install directory. This I checked after printing the directory location in each case i.e while running from exe and from shortcuts.<br />
Thank you MSG for your reply.:)</div></div><hr />
