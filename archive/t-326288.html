<br />
I've been using NSIS for years now and always recommend it to anyone who will listen but I've notice the last maintenance release was 2.46 and that was over a year ago.<br />
<br />
Is NSIS being sunsetted?  Will their be a 3.0?  Or is something else entirely going on and I'm just out of the loop or something? :confused:<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

Unicode support would be highly appreciated by us, because we do have some issues with Russian language on machines with non-Russian locale. Hope to see the new release this year at least!</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but that doesn't show the project is still active to anyone who isn't an active NSIS developer.<br />
<br />
The website needs to illustrate to audiences who are not active NSIS developers that the work is still going on. Especially when the website doesn't highlight links directly to the SF project -- only a small footer image/link.<br />
<br />
To illustrate the current activity beyond releases, there needs to be some form of activity blotter on the front page, just as there's a blotter for forums.<br />
<br />
What would be more helpful is a statement on the progress of moving NSIS to Unicode. The front page can be short and sweet with the statement. A bonus if it linked to a new page which illustrated what the roadmap to Unicode is. Frankly, I have no idea what the status is. Again, lack of communication unless you're already in &quot;the know&quot;.</div></div><hr />

http://code.google.com/p/unsis/downloads/list<br />
<br />
Also: NSIS works very good and very reliably for me. Features missing in the &quot;core&quot; of NSIS can be added easily by plug-in's. So why are you crying for a new release? Is there actually any issue with core NSIS that would make a new release mandatory? IMHO the most important shortcoming of current NSIS is the lack of Unicode support, but Unicode NSIS resolves that issue. Even most plug-in's now have a Unicode version. And I think in the 'trunk' version (basis for a possible future release) there also is Unicode support now...<br />

AFAIK version 2 of LZMA is better suited for multi-threading, but actually gives worse compression than the original LZMA.<br />

<br />
No, the NTFS limit is 32k (for the total path and 255 per element) but to use such paths you need to use the \\?\ prefix (Not everything it the shell supports this but most of the low-level file functions do. You also lose relative paths support...)<br />

http://www.scratchpaper.com/<br />

<br />
I have to agree with previous comments in this thread, though. The average &quot;joe&quot; (like me) looking for a InstallShield alternative or just a capable MSWin installer/packager will feel disappointment when they learn that the latest release is years old. I really had to dig to find that there was activity, based on forum and feature request tracker. I would recommend that one of the core developers or project lead (if there is one) add some kind of status at least on the main page near the date of the &quot;Latest NSIS release&quot; December 06, 2009. I almost clicked away but my curiosity compelled me to look further, wondering why the SourceForge project page said &quot;Last Update: 2012-11-13&quot;.<br />
<br />
The description on the main project Wiki page seems very promising. I especially liked the fact that NSIS is packaged with RHEL/CentOS as part of the mingw32 cross-compiler set. This would allow us to automate packaging of Windoze projects directly from our source code CM system in CentOS 6. Unfortunately, the 2GB size limit on installers turned out to be a deal-breaker for us, for now anyway. I manage and maintain the networks and network services for a low-budget engineering support facility for aircraft training systems. The projects for which we wanted to replace InstallShield contain a large number of high-res graphics, not compressible to &lt; 2GB. <br />
<br />
We'll probably go with Inno Setup for now because it seems to be the most efficient way for our MS Windows developers to migrate away from InstallShield. They are motivated to move too, referring to the MS product as &quot;a steaming pile of...&quot; well, you get the idea. Inno Setup seems to have a fairly intuitive UI with some useful plugins. I've got them testing it right now.<br />
<br />
I do intend to keep my eye on this project, though, hoping the latest and greatest will make the cut in Fedora, at least before Red Hat settles on the baseline for RHEL 7. They included the mingw32 cross-compiler packages (including mingw32-nsis) only in their &quot;Optional&quot; channel for EL 6 and only the x86_64 version, which means they're not officially supported or updated but at least they're part of the base install. I frequently use the mingw32 compilers to build/rebuild Win32 Stunnel executables and OpenSSL libraries for local distribution so I may experiment with NSIS periodically.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the NSIS developers for your generous gift of time and talent.</div></div><hr />

NSIS is using signed ints, that's why we are limited to 2Gb. We cannot just switch to unsigned either because we are using the top bit to store extra data...</div></div><hr />

<br />
(The only thing it could speed-up would be building the installer - at the cost of bigger installer size)<br />
<br />
I played around with lzma vs lzma2 today a lot. There is no significant size difference between lzma and lzma2 on maximum compression settings - using 7zip 9.29 alpha (any other settings don't matter, because lzma2 is always faster - mx9 compresses faster to lzma2 on a quadcore, compared to mx3 on lzma). The version used in nsis actually compresses consistently worse to lzma, than 9.29 to lzma2 (tested by compressing with nsis, vs feeding nsis lzma2 mx9 already compressed files and switching compress of).<br />
<br />
It would be really great to have lzma2 supported by Nsis and having Nsis move to up to date 7z version (nowadays speed matters much more than maybe 40-50KB increase in installer size due newest 7z - though I doubt it would make such a big difference).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second thing in line of course would be great to have proper filesize &gt;2GB support - too bad if this won't make it into Nsis 3 - whenever it appears...</div></div><hr />
