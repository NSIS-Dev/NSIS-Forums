<br />
We have made a utility available that automates the procedure for creating an installer that patches multiple files.<br />
<br />
The &quot;NsisPatchGen&quot; utility recursively compares two directory structures looking for changes to the files and subdirectories. It produces an NSIS include file containing functions that will perform a patch upgrade from the original structure to the new.<br />
<br />
nsisPatchGen uses the VPatch genpat.exe utility to generate patch files, and calls VPatch plugin function calls from the generated NSIS file.<br />
<br />
nsisPatchGen can be downloaded from:<br />
<br />
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsispatchgen <br />
<br />
Hope some of you find it useful :)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
Bruce</div></div><hr />

Would be nice if you could put up a Wiki page for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Code6226</div><div class="date">25th June 2006, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like your program.<br />
<br />
I'm new to the GPL though. <br />
I'm working on a closed-source program. Would it be ok if I included your exe with my program (I'd give credit and include/link to the source code of your program, just not to the source code of my program)? <br />
My program doesn't use any source code from your program, it just executes it.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this would be ok under the Lesser GPL (since that one specifies that even library LGPL code can be used by a closed-source program, so an EXE would be even less of an issue).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">25th June 2006, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Under GPL that is probably a deriative work, so it's not allowed unless you get permission from all contributors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">viperpiper</div><div class="date">25th August 2006, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Code626,<br />
<br />
I'm new to the GPL myself - though it was my understanding that using the exe would have been OK.<br />
<br />
I certainly don't mind the program being used in the manner you describe. As the only contributers so far are the original authors then you have our permission.<br />
<br />
Any GPL experts out there that can give a definitive answer on this?</div></div><hr />

No script, no pat files?<br />
<br />
I have added VPATCH with the path where genpat.exe is located to the enviroment variables and added %VPATCH% to the path. I am currently running Windows Vista.</div></div><hr />
