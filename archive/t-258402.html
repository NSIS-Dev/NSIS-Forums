<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PerryRho</div><div class="date">27th October 2006, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Modern UI installer structure with an entry for a custom page that launches one of my applications at the end of the installation process,<br />
like<br />
  ...<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_STARTMENU Application $ICONS_GROUP<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES<br />
  !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;$INSTDIR\MySpecialApp.exe&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_UNPAGE_CONFIRM<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES<br />
<br />
Now I define 3 InstTypes, and Type 2 is without installing MySpecialApp.<br />
When within the installation process I choose Type 2, I have to make sure that the &quot;Run MySpecialApp now&quot; page is not displayed for this InstType.<br />
I fail repeatedly.<br />
Mostly because &quot;if[InstType2] - then[don't display that thing]&quot; conditions must appear in sections or functions, but the installer page listn is not within a function, but apparently plain body text after the header.<br />
Is it possible to switch an installer page on or off depending on the InstType value?<br />
I didn't see any related thread in the forum. If there is any, and I was just too blind - a link will be my friend.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
John.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th October 2006, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">You've missed the FAQ (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FAQ) which contains an entry about skipping pages (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Skipping_Pages).<br />
<br />
To figure out which installation type was selected, you can use GetCurInstType, but it'd be simpler to check if $INSTDIR\MySpecialApp.exe exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PerryRho</div><div class="date">1st November 2006, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">So I tried ...<br />
<br />
but sorry, I couldn't see any useful hint in the FAQ for this problem.<br />
The main thing seems to be that I cannot build a function that  is able to switch between the finish pages<br />
MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;$INSTDIR\MySpecialApp.exe&quot;<br />
and<br />
MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
depending on the value of e.g. GetCurInstType. Either it isn't allowed to call macros containing that AutoCloseWindow parameter from within a function (as MUI_PAGE_FINISH is one of them), or it is impossible to use an if-then-condition outside a function. And I try to make an installer whose pages can be activated or deactivated depending on the InstallType, like <br />
&quot;if InstallType is [a], then call finishpage 1, else call finishpage 2&quot;<br />
I still can't figure out where this &quot;else&quot; has to be placed.<br />
I hope anyone has a straw for me to clutch on.</div></div><hr />
