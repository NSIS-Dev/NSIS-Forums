<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">6th May 2007, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I was overwriting any previously installed files in my &quot;id&quot; folder, with the code below. However, I just learned that the previously installed files in fact are not being overwritten. Could I get some guidance on this, please?<br />
<br />
  ; ***** definitely overwrite product id file(s) *****<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\misc\id\&quot;<br />
  SetOverwrite on<br />
  File /nonfatal /r &quot;c:\myAppfolder\misc install\id\*.*&quot;</div></div><hr />

In which case, use /rebootok on File so that any files that could not be overwritten at time of installation will be overwritten after a reboot.<br />

After your reply did not seem to indicate that my code was defective, I took a closer look and found that I was running an older installer that did not reflect the code in question here.  So I'm ok.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
