<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ctc1989</div><div class="date">4th January 2013, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on an installer where I need access to what someone &quot;names&quot; the CD the Installation .exe is on.<br />
<br />
Is there anything like ${GetExePath}, but that grabs the actual name of the media as opposed to what drive it is in?<br />
<br />
So if I placed a CD named &quot;MyCd&quot; into my D drive, a command that would return me &quot;MyCd&quot; as opposed to D: if I called ${GetExePath}.  Crossing my fingers.  Thanks guys</div></div><hr />

You can use DVD_GetLabel, and perhaps DVD_GetNextDrive to enumerate through all CD/DVD drives. http://nsis.sourceforge.net/DVD_functions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ctc1989</div><div class="date">4th January 2013, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Amazing, thanks I will give that a try.<br />
<br />
Also, as a long time lurker, first time poster, I would like to thank everyone because anything I am ever curious about pertaining to NSIS, someone has likely asked it and been answered here!  Great community, tons of help.  :up:<br />
<br />
Edit:  Worked exactly as I wanted it to, and has got me out of a serious jam.  Many thanks MSG</div></div><hr />
