<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assefa</div><div class="date">18th October 2005, 05:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I went through the forum/examples to pick up useful scripts to create virtual directories for IIS (like http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/Setting_up_a_virtual_directory).<br />
I have seen several tests using vb scripts to validate the error code returned when a virtual directories. These scripts test genarally for a value that is diffrent from 0. I have also seen tests on error code -2147024713 (which means the the virtual dir already exists).<br />
<br />
 I came accross an error code -2147463162 but could not identify what the problem is. Do someone knows where to get information that can help me make sense of this error code ?<br />
<br />
 Thanks</div></div><hr />

Try searching for one of those, some useful post might come on up. Maybe even the error name, along with the exact line it's raised on, we'll do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assefa</div><div class="date">18th October 2005, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input. I did found some posts related this error code but not something that I was able to say was the definitive answer. The vb script is pretty simple :<br />
  Set Root = GetObject(&quot;IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC/1/ROOT&quot;)<br />
  Set Dir = Root.Create(&quot;IIsWebVirtualDir&quot;, &quot;ttt&quot;)<br />
<br />
It does work locally on my machine using Xp Pro and IIS 5.1 and gives an error code on another machine using also Xp and IIS5.1.  I do not have all the settings of the computer that it is failing on so I was trying to reproduce the error locally. Unfortunaltely I did not manage until now.  <br />
If I get something I will post it but I seems to be out of idea/luck.</div></div><hr />
