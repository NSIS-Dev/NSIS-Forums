<br />
I have tried to search for this problem but without any answer and..I am new to Nsis so be gently =)<br />
<br />
Anyway, i am trying to embedd a installer (for a program called jt2go) and trying to execute it in nsis but it does not get through the nsis compiler.<br />
<br />
The program can do a silent installations typing:<br />
<br />
JT2GoSetup.exe /s /v&quot;/qb+ AGREE_TO_JT2GO_LICENSE=Yes INSTALLDIR=\&quot;C:\Program Files\UGS\JT2Go\&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
in the cmd<br />
<br />
As i understand it /qb+ is not really a silent installation but a basic UI, but how do i translate this string into NSIS with all the quotations ??<br />
<br />
<br />
i tried:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
File &quot;c:\gh\JT2GoSetup.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
ExecWait '$INSTDIR\JT2GoSetup.exe /s /v&quot;/qb+ AGREE_TO_JT2GO_LICENSE=Yes INSTALLDIR=\&quot;C:\Program Files\UGS\JT2Go\&quot;&quot;'<br />
<br />
also, can i replace the INSTALLDR=\ to $INSTDIR to make it install directly under where the user unpack the nsis ??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice!<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Linda<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Linda_24</div><div class="date">18th October 2008, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi kukomamasan!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your replay, but i do use NSIS as my main installer. However i need to include a installshield installer into my own NSIS installer. <br />
<br />
I thought ExecWait was a option in NSIS to start the process (equal to go to the DOS prompt and typing the silent installation string) of making a silent installation of the included program ..but mabey i am wrong here. <br />
<br />
any advice?..i dont thik i can just run the installshield and then include what has been &quot;unziped&quot; into my own NSIS becuase it writes thing into the register.<br />
<br />
Does it make sense ??<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
i tried just typing jt2go.exe in the execWait command and the installshield gets &quot;nested&quot; into my NSIS..for me that is a ok solution..but it would o fcourse be a bit nicer if the silent installation could work.<br />
<br />
I am sure there just some problem with the quotations &quot;&quot; in the cmd string. i tried some $ combinations but no luck. If anyone can transform that string into NSIS that would be great!!<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
ExecWait '&quot;c:\path\program.exe&quot; /something /somethingelse=&quot;hello world&quot; /bye'</div></div><hr />
