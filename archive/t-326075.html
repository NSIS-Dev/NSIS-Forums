<br />
I have a .net application which can accept an image on a drag&amp;drop event.<br />
<br />
When I install the application on Win7 and run it automatically from the last page of the installer, the drag&amp;drop doesn't work in the app. When I close and run my app from the installed folder<br />
it works. This happens only in Win7 - in XP/Vista the drag&amp;drop works even when the app is run directly from the NSIS installer.<br />
<br />
I've tried both<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;$INSTDIR\myapp.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Function autorun<br />
SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
Exec '&quot;$INSTDIR\myapp.exe&quot;'<br />
Functionend<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN<br />
!define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_FUNCTION autorun<br />
<br />
<br />
Grateful for any suggestions on what might be causing the problem - i.e. is there a different mode how to run the executable from the script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">17th January 2011, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">it's because your run app is elevated due to UAC and so is at a different level to Explorer which prevents drag and drop working. generally the easiest fix is to just not auto-run the app after install as from what i've been told there are ways to sort of de-elevate things for the app to be run but it's hacky and has issues.<br />
