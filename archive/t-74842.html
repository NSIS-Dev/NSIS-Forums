<br />
I found the following in install options:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Using a DirRequest control, InstallOptions adds new fields to the ini file (take a look at the attached zip). These new fields contain the states of the buttons. Why does InstOpts do this? Buttons are generated again at loading the ini so why saving it's state?<br />
 If you use an edit field and adapt the length so that it's nice and then change the edit field into a DirRequest, the button+edit field (together) do not have the length of the previous edit field. Try it yourself with the ini in the supplied zip. Changing a DirRequest into a Text causes the Text to exceed the window.<br />
[/list=1]<br />
<br />
If you have some comment on above statements, please post it here.<br />
<br />
Thx, greetz,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">8th February 2002, 07:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's clarify my problem:<br />
<br />
I had a program using InstOpts with a lot of edit boxes. The number of edit boxes was variable, so I just tried to read the INI to the end instead of using NumFields in Settings. Then I changed these into DirRequest. The first thing I noticed was that all boxes (including the buttons) had been shrinking, so I had to re-aline everything once again. Then my program crashed because when processing the INI it suddenly found some weird extra fields that are totally useless...<br />
<br />
That's why my previous post...<br />
<br />
Will this be changed in the future? Does ne1 know why this is?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thx, greetz,<br />
