<br />
I've searched the entire fourm but came up with nothing!!<br />
I'm a new user of NSIS &amp; I'm stuck. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to install 3rd party softwares (Tomcat, JDK, Netscape) &amp; an application of my own which uses them.<br />
<br />
The question here is i don't know how to extract the 3rd party programs into a temp folder, check the versions and then run their installations and once the 3 of them are over install my program.<br />
<br />
And in case of uninstall also give options to the cust to uninstall any of them but complusory my program<br />
<br />
Any help!!<br />
<br />

And as for Tomcat if you find out tell me please cos I have no idea and have looked hard!<br />
<br />
Use nsExec::Exec to run the install executables.<br />
<br />
Use the InitPluginsDir to get a temporary folder, and just use the File command to place any temporary files into it (refer to it using $PLUGINSDIR).<br />
<br />
As for the uninstall, err you'll need to write err actually not sure and a bit busy atm sorry :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">17th January 2005, 07:36</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use something like this<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
File j2re-1_3_1_13-windows-i586.exe<br />
ExecWait j2re-1_3_1_13-windows-i586.exe<br />
Delete j2re-1_3_1_13-windows-i586.exe<br />
<br />
For DOS apps use nsExec or http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=181442<br />
BTW single-file package is important for Internet downloads, from CD you can run apps from $EXEDIR.<br />
I saw sample on this forum with empty super-installer runnig a set of installers using ExecWait and temporary hiding itsels till execWait returns. Install options list can solve both install &amp; uninstall problems.</div></div><hr />
