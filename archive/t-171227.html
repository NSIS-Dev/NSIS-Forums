<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harpsoft</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some software that is installed using Java Web Start. I'd like a .exe install program that I could use to accomplish the install, so I can submit the software to shareware sites. It looks like NSIS can do this. I am also willing to pay a couple bucks (say $20US - yeah, not much, but maybe a quick buck for someone who's already knows NSIS).<br />
<br />
I need the following install process:<br />
1) Has user agree to license.<br />
2) Checks for JRE and if not installed, prompts user to install (should auto-install 1.4+ as simply as possible, but download should _NOT_ include the JRE since its too big).<br />
3) Creates shortcut(s) to launch software (an URL)<br />
4) Launch now option / Exits gracefully.<br />
<br />
I see the JRE check is already written:<br />

<br />
If you could do this let me know. The software that needs this install program is at:<br />

<br />
You're technically correct in saying that shareware is &quot;commercial software&quot;, but it's hardly &quot;commercial software&quot; in the sense I'm not charging $500+ a copy.<br />
<br />
I did not mean to offend. I've had implementations as responses to posts in the past for free. I just don't mind adding a token reward this time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The difficult task in this case is the JRE detection and downloading.<br />
<br />
To create a really good JRE check, some research about JRE locations and configuration files is necessary. Then, script code has to be created that handles these checks.<br />
<br />
A nice dialog would have to be designed to inform the user about the JRE installation status and download options.<br />
<br />
And of course the downloading should be handled, include error checks, maybe some download mirrors etc.<br />
<br />
When this has finished, the JRE should be installed silently in the background and the return codes or results of the installation should be checked.<br />
<br />
And then you still need to test the installer in different situation to make sure it works fine.<br />
<br />
Altogether, it will take a few hours, so I think you really can't find someone to do it for just 20 bucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harpsoft</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The JRE check script in the Nullsoft archive is sufficient for my purposes.<br />
<br />
A message stating that the JRE download will be downloaded and internet connection needed (with a browser install from javasoft.com) would be fine (it would be the best install anyway). I suppose the install should do a recheck to make sure it was installed. Then shortcut creation is all that's needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">hi<br />
<br />
i think the problem is not the money instead JRE itself or someone who has both and some time. u only have 2 find him... (not me)<br />
<br />
since i know nsis i did a lot for others including shareware - 4 nothing.<br />
conclusion now is that i had to suspend work due to some mixes between real and virtual life.<br />
but if someone asks me i wont deny if i can see light at the end of tunnel.<br />
<br />
good luck..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">29th February 2004, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">to answer your questions:<br />
<br />
1) Has user agree to license.<br />
-&gt; that's a default function of NSIS. just include a license-page. there are 3 possibilities to accept or decline the license:<br />
radio-buttons, a checkbox, or simply a &quot;accept&quot;-button instead of &quot;next&quot; (all those possibilities are implemented).<br />
<br />
2) Checks for JRE and if not installed, prompts user to install (should auto-install 1.4+ as simply as possible, but download should _NOT_ include the JRE since its too big).<br />
-&gt; this is the realy interesting part. the others already said enough, i think.<br />
<br />
3) Creates shortcut(s) to launch software (an URL)<br />
-&gt; realy easy.<br />
a normal with the &quot;CreateShortcut&quot; or an internet shortcut by the &quot;CreateInternetShortcut&quot;-macro from the archive-page (look at my signature).<br />
<br />
4) Launch now option / Exits gracefully.<br />
-&gt; available with the modern ui, only few lines of code.<br />
and this function is also very good documented.<br />
<br />
i think, u should at least code #1, #3 and #4 yourself.<br />
i'm sure u'll get very good help about #2 here in the forums.</div></div><hr />
