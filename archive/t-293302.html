<br />
When I run my installer (it's a big file: 1.5Gb)on Vista there is a displayed message indicating to wait with a percentage, so it's a good thing. But on XP system, I have to wait a time (around 1 or 2 minutes) before having this message, is there a way to have this message displayed as soon as I have run the setup without any wait time (like on my vista system) ?<br />
 It's for a wab distribution, so I don't want to use a disk spanning system, I'd like to have only one file to download</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if you see that message at startup it indicates there is something wrong with your installer! Usually your installer should startup (almost) immediately, even if it's very large. Make sure you use &quot;ReserveFile&quot; to reserve all plugins you use and all other files that are extracted &quot;out of order&quot; (not in the order they appear in the script). For example extracting files in your &quot;.onInit&quot; function can cause problem, if that function is located after the install sections in your script. Those files would be extracted immediately when your installer starts up, but they would have been added at the very end of the installer's data block. Obviously it will take a very long time to extract, making the installer startup sloooow! The bigger the installer, the slower it will start up. Reserving those files at the beginning of your installer script (using ReserveFile) solves the problem once and for all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winniethepooh</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">oops, I'm new with NSIS and I didn't use the reservefile. I will add them and test.<br />
<br />
Just a question, I knwo that I have to add the picture I use for the setup. But I have alsoo seen that I have to add some of the dll used by NSIS plugin. I have used The modernui plugin and also the advsplash, so what dll have I to add?<br />
The AdvSplash.dll I guess, but for the others I don't know...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the LZMA compression (non solid)<br />
<br />
And here comes the beginning of my script, if someone can tell me what to add in the reserve file... Many thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the Vista message show with CRCCheck off? If so then it's built in to Vista and not something you will have on XP.<br />
<br />
One option you have is to have a launcher but you will need two files then of course.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winniethepooh</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your answer, having several files is a real problem for me to make my setup downloadable. <br />
<br />
The message isn't displayed with the CRCCheck off (so it's the crc message, you can see a screen of the message attached). But I don't understand why it is displayed as soon as I run the exe on vista and some minutes later in XP (tested on several machines).<br />
<br />
So is there a difference between the work of the setup on vista and XP? <br />
How can I fix my problem, so how to make the message being displayed as soon as I run the exe on XP too (with only one file)?<br />
<br />
Because at this time, the long waiting time on XP before displaying anything can let thinking the setup is not working (even if it's not the case).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen long delays like you describe caused by the antivirus program. It tries to scan the NSIS installer for viruses, and may take some time before it permits it to execute. You said your installer is 1.5 GB. Do smaller installers open faster? How much memory is in your XP system, and do you have an antivirus program running?<br />
<br />
My home XP system did very slow virus checks until I upgraded the memory from .5 GB to 2 GB.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">In XP it could be down to network unconnectivity (i.e. disconnected mapped drives), anti virus software, lack of disk space, NTFS compression, indexing service etc. Either way in my experience I have never seen a setup take over 1 minute to open as far as I can remember unless it is from over a network.<br />

Setup are not run via the network. I will finally tried with a disk spanning setup (as soon as I find how do it with nsis) and will put all files in an autoextractible zip...</div></div><hr />
