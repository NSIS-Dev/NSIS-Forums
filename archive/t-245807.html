<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillSh</div><div class="date">9th May 2006, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm new to NSIS and am running into a problem trying to extract a file from our zip2exe installer.  What I'm trying to do is get a file out of the exe prior to the main install so that I can run it in order to kill any of our active processes prior to upgrade.<br />
<br />
The problem appears to be that I can't consistently identify the path to that file.  I'm starting to understand how File pulls files in.  'File foo.exe' gives a file not found error during compile.  'File /r foo.exe' gives me the file, but under something like z282324.tmp which would be inconsistent and is probably not something I can capture in order to ExecWait on it (is there a variable that will capture that path so I can reference it in a script?).<br />
<br />
My *very ugly* workaround (read: Hack of Doom) is to set the install dir to a local staging dir, install there and then on .onInstSuccess, run my process killer and then CopyFiles the files to where I want them and clean up.  Ewwww! :-)<br />
<br />
Is there any method for me to refer to a file in the exe and extract it on the fly?  Or resolve this .tmp dir name w/o having do to some sort of FindFirst/Next call to track down this file?<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

File &quot;local\path_to\file.ext&quot;<br />
<br />
Or:<br />
File &quot;/oname=$INSTDIR\file.ext&quot; &quot;local\path_to\file.ext&quot;<br />
<br />
You're better off not using ZipToExe for your final product if you can help it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillSh</div><div class="date">9th May 2006, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks!  That got me running for now.  I'll look at ditching the Zip2Exe stuff and writing a real script.  We don't have a complicated setup, so it should be pretty easy.  I'll also try to track down that plug-in.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
