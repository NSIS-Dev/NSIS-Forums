<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cedit</div><div class="date">3rd June 2005, 07:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an application which I periodicly release called cEditMX.  In the early days it was a fairly small download but as time goes on it's getting progressivly bigger.  A complete download of it currently weighs in around 6MB which granted isn't big really but on a dialup connection that can take a while to download.  Anyway I was wondering if there is any built in support or perhaps offshoots of the NSIS installer that support Downloader installation IE it would download the files the user wishes to install, also making it possible to keep the file smaller for people just updating the program who don't need everything just for one or 2 things which have been changed.  Any info is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Your website looks cool btw, maybe if I find time I will try you editor !<br />
