<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">31st July 2005, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to call the 'IsOS' function of shlwapi.dll. <br />
<br />
MSDN link:<br />
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/shlwapi/others/IsOS.asp<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, when I use Dependency Walker on Shlwapi.dll, I don't see the IsOS function on the list of functions.  (each time I try to call it using the system plugin, I get an error returned.)<br />
<br />
I belive my syntax is correct (see sample below):<br />
<br />
   StrCpy $1 8 ; to detect win2k or higher<br />
   System::call &quot;shlwapi.dll::IsOS(i r1)i .r2&quot;<br />
<br />
I've tried other values for $1 too, but always $2 returns 'error'.<br />
<br />
My current version of shlwapi.dll on Win2k is 6.0.2800.1612.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I'm trying to determine if an installation is being run on a terminal server or not and this was the only function I've found so far that should work the same on any flavor of Windows.<br />
<br />
Any comments/suggestions are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pidgeot</div><div class="date">31st July 2005, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I may be wrong, but if I understand the System Readme correctly, you're not supposed to put .dll in the Call command. Of course, since I have no experience with using the plugin, it could be optional and I don't know about it.<br />
<br />
As for detecting the terminal server thing, it looks like this might be usable:<br />
OS_TERMINALCLIENT 14 Windows 2000/Windows XP/Windows Server 2003 The program is running as a Terminal Server client. Equivalent to GetSystemMetrics(SM_REMOTESESSION). <br />
<br />
So if you can't get this working, then GetSystemMetrics might be usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">31st July 2005, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm.. I think I must have misread GetSystemMetrics before.  :o <br />
<br />
The command you mentioned (SM_REMOTESESSION) works on Win2k and above (which is what I want).  But the other command next to it (SM_REMOTECONTROL) does not work on Win2k.  This is why I though that IsOS was the only way to go.  But now I read this and see that GetSystemMetrics just might work!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply, Pidgeot!  (Now I will play...)<br />
:D <br />
<br />
For anyone that cares, here's the MSDN link for GetSystemMetrics:<br />
