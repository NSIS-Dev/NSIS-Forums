<br />
I am using NSIS for some software my company uses.  The software itself is actually two different packages; both of which use InstallShield installers.  I'm using NSIS to chain them together.  Both packages require reboots once finished, but they are not dependent on each other.  Because of this, we can put off rebooting until both have been installed and effectively change two reboots down to one.  I have NSIS perform a reboot at the end.  However, I don't trust my users enough to select &quot;No, I will reboot my computer later&quot; when prompted both times by InstallShield.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone has any idea on how to force the installer to not reboot and not prompt the user (or at a minimum, prevent the system from being rebooted).  I'm sure this is a long shot, but I thought I'd check anyway.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

2) Maybe the InstallShield installers can be configured with command line parameters, so you can use NSIS to control 'em?<br />
<br />
3) Convert the InstallShield installers to NSIS :)<br />
<br />
4) Add a RunOnce entry to start your NSIS installer again if the user has rebooted.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the response!<br />
<br />
I did find out how to set up a script for a silent install on InstallShield, so that appears to be working for me.  The script is automatically answering no to the reboot question and NSIS is controlling it well.<br />
<br />
I would really like to convert them both to NSIS, but I can't see where NSIS has support for installing services.  The Services.dll plugin seems to only support operations on an already existing service.  Is there any way to install services under NSIS?</div></div><hr />

Search the MSDN for more info.</div></div><hr />
