<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john.mcnamee</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on an installation that involves thousands of files that add up to a lot of data (1.5 GB and growing!).  I don't want one huge setup.exe.  What I really need is a small setup.exe and a few setupxxx.dat files (one per section would be great).  I looked at CopyFiles, but that would require thousands of uncompressed files on the install media.  I also looked at creating a silent installer for each component, and having the main installer run each one as a child process.  That kind of works, but has a bad user interface.  The progress bar and status window only update as each component gets installed, rather than each file.<br />
<br />
Please tell me there's some way to do this with NSIS, so I don't have to switch to Microsoft Installer :cry:</div></div><hr />

NSIS can handle'em :)</div></div><hr />

How about ZIP, RAR, CAB compress formats?<br />
NSIS can handle'em :)<br />
Maybe I'm being especially dense today. :(  After reading the documentation and searching the FAQ and forum, I didn't see how NSIS could do this.<br />
<br />
Let's say I have an external ZIP file.  How do I get NSIS to extract it?  Remember, I need to show each filename in the status window and move the progress bar, as if I was using File commands.  In other words, I want to replace<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Name&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
  File &quot;..\Foobar\file1.dat&quot;<br />
  File &quot;..\Foobar\file2.dat&quot;<br />
  ;...<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
with something like<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Name&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
  Unzip &quot;$EXEDIR\foobar.zip&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
and have the user experience remain exactly the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd still have to unpack each file and then zip.  If you wanted to show each file, you can simple use a DetailPrint command for each file you are uncompressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 08:54</div></div><div class="posttext">This interests me as well - how would one go about finding out the paths of each unzipped file, assuming one used some sort of blanket unzipall method?</div></div><hr />
