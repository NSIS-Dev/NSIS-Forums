I attached a code snippet to install a ISAPI Filter and a virtual Directory in the new IIS Metabase Configuration File. <br />
It creates and executes an vbscript with the windows scripting host. (very pedantic, if there is a better solution please let my know) <br />
Details at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/iisref/htm/EnablingISAPIFilters.asp?frame=true<br />
My file is a part of a jakarta redirector install script but i think you can easily customize it for your own purposes.<br />
<br />
I am not very experienced with nsis ( :eek: pushing and popping :igor: ), so if someone find this code usefull, perhaps he can put it in some generally usable functions and put it to the archive?<br />
<br />
greetings<br />
dani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jhegge</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I also need to install/uninstall an ISAPI filter DLL.  I looked at this script and tried it out.  It installs the filter correctly, though having to restart w3svc is a bit painful.  <br />
<br />
Now, the uninstall section looks right.  It does remove the filter object and after restarting IIS, this looks right.  However, after a re-install of the same, I see two filters in the load list.  I'm trying to understand the LoadOrder object, this string removal isn't working.  <br />
<br />
A script I found here shows the list of filters in the LoadOrder: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/scripts/iis/iis5x/admin/i5advb05.mspx<br />
<br />
Does anyone have enough vbs experience to help out with this?</div></div><hr />
