<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tderouin</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I've run into a weird problem with hotkeys and an installer.<br />
<br />
If you download a installer that has MUI and run it, the first page is just the welcome page. Hit N to proceed to the license page, the next button is focused. You'll notice that the initially for the first fraction of a second, on the 2nd page, the (A) accept button is in focus, but it appears possibly that as soon as the license loads inside the dialog, the accept button loses focus and the user has to push ALT+A to proceed, instead of just A.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Press Enter to go the next page.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">billym</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I have ran into a usability issue that I need help with. I know this is little but here it goes. On the license page I have the radio buttons to accept or decline the license. If I am on the top radio button I have to push the up arrow key to get it to go down and vise versa. Can someone please tell me how to fix this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th July 2004, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">The tab order is set by the order the controls are created which is set by the order they are defined in the resource section. You just have to swtich between the two.</div></div><hr />
