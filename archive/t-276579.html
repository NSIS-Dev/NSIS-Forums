<br />
I have received a late requirement from my customer that my Multi-language UMUI Installer should also run in Japanese language. (It currently runs in English, German &amp; French)<br />
<br />
Using UMUI and after adding the Japanese language support (!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Japanese&quot;); as I execute my installer, the left, header and footer images are all not alligned.<br />
<br />
I have attached a zipped sample screen shot with this post (UMUI_Inst_JapaneseLanguage.JPG). As seen from the attached image, the left, header and footer bitmap images are out of shape as I execute the installer in Japanese language.<br />
<br />
This seems to only happen if I execute the installer running on East Asian languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean). It does not affect english and other european languages (Refer to the zipped attached UMUI_Inst_JapaneseLanguage.JPG)<br />
<br />
I tried resizing the left image bitmap, but though it seems to improve the display in Japanese language, the English Installer images now are out of shape.<br />
<br />
For your information, my PC DPI is set as 96 DPI (Standard). I have raised a similar issue before, but the previous issue was related with PC DPI settings[http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=258717&amp;highlight=UMUI]. In this issue, although I am using the normal 96 DPI, the UMUI Installer in Japanese/East Asian languages run out of shape.<br />
<br />
If you want to simulate this issue, you could try executing the &quot;MultiLanguage.nsi&quot; inside the Ultra Modern UI examples. Select Japanese, Chinese or Korean languages to simulate this problem.<br />
<br />
Please advice me on this issue. Are there any countermeasures?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can test to edit the Contrib\UltraModernUI\UMUI.nsh<br />
and replace all the <br />
SetBrandingImage <br />
by<br />
SetBrandingImage /RESIZETOFIT<br />
<br />
I cannot test if this fix works well at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have taken your advice and added &quot;/RESIZETOFIT&quot; to the &quot;SetBrandingImage&quot; strings in UMUI.nsh.<br />
<br />
It works great. My multilanguage installer is able to excute in Japanese language with the branding images properly aligned.<br />
<br />
Problem fixed!<br />
<br />
Thanks a million.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have restored my faith into UMUI&quot;</div></div><hr />
