<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cervantes</div><div class="date">14th May 2004, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">this one has me mistified. If I type in<br />
<br />
C:\program\uninst.exe /S<br />
<br />
into a dos box the uninstaller works fine.<br />
<br />
If I run the above command from a batch file it works.<br />
<br />
If i call it from another program then the uninstall deletes uninst.exe, some text files are removed but nothing else.<br />
<br />
files that were locked get removed on reboot but everything else (registry entries, shortcuts) are not removed.<br />
<br />
I moved the delete commands around so that those files that could be locked are deleted last thinking the installer was failing on the locked files but there was no change in behavior.<br />
<br />
has anyone experienced this before?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
Are you sure the programs that come with the package aren't running?<br />
<br />
files that were locked get removed on reboot but everything else (registry entries, shortcuts) are not removed.<br />
<br />
Registry entries should be at least removed at the same time and the shortcuts at least removed after reboot. Can you attach the script, please? What NSIS and Windows version are you using?</div></div><hr />
