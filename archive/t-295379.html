<br />
I have a 32 bit installer with 32 bit plugins and I am trying to get it to work on 64 bit.<br />
<br />
If I look at the logs, all I can see is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Could not load &lt;valid path to dll&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there any way to enable more logging/debug info?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
T.</div></div><hr />

:(  Please don't double-post.  The more people you annoy, the harder it will be to get answers.<br />
<br />
Since no one else has tried, I'll try to offer something.  I am not aware of any specific tools you can use.  But then again, I don't write plug-ins either.  The only debug tool I am aware of is the debug plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nsisdbg_plug-in), but it doesn't seem to offer anything related to plug-ins themselves.<br />
<br />
A few questions that might help you get to answer:  <br />
  do all plug-ins fail or just certain ones?<br />
  Have you tried running the install on 32-bit machines?  What about other versions of Windows?<br />
 Did you write the plug-in(s)?  If not, have you tried to contact the author(s)?<br />
  Is there anything in the Windows event logs? <br />
<br />
That's about all I can offer.  If you're patient, you might get some help from some of the other fine plug-in authors that happen to read this forum.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for replying. I keep asking the wrong question I guess...<br />

<br />
I figured it out, quite stupid really. basically I am stuck with the following options:<br />
<br />
1. nullsoft 32 bit cant load 64 bit plugin<br />
2. nullsoft 32 bit can load 32 bit plugin, but 32 bit plugin cant load 64 dependency on 64 bit machine...<br />
<br />
So basically I need to convert my DLL into an exe and work from there.<br />
<br />
And if that fails two installers <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
