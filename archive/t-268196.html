<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zethris</div><div class="date">22nd March 2007, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have located an issue with the core .net 2.0 framework released 1/22/2006 where the uninstaller, in typical micro$oft fashion doesn't remove all 1million registry keys that it writes upon installation. What happens is if you come to a system that may have had .net 2.0 installed and uninstalled, then re-installed for whatever reason there is a increasing risk each time this happens that .net will leave too many stray registry entries and then not re-install properly. Some programs (like services) that rely on it to run then will not run. <br />
<br />
My question is, since there is no remove tool, and there seems to be a fix for this in .net 2.0 SP1 (released 7/11/2006) the only choice I have is to follow up a .net installation with the sp1 installation right after in my install script. Which bring up a whole other can of worms. <br />
<br />
Currently when the installer executes, it first checks to see what version, if any, of .net is installed. If it doesn't see the minimum version, or it's just not there it will prompt to install it as a requirement or Quit if they cancel. <br />
<br />
Now, it seems, I will need that functionality, plus once it is installed to then look to see if .net 2.0 SP1 is also installed. Or, if it already see's .net 2.0, but not SP1 (either case) it will prompt to install the SP1. <br />
<br />
Note: in the current installation, I also have it require version 1.4.2 of the java runtime environment with a similar detect and install if not found routine that comes after .net 2.0 will install. I am not sure if that changes anything, but I just wanted to be thorough on things. <br />
<br />
Would it be better to just install 3.0 as it seems to also include 2.0 as well? edit: bah! I guess they got rid of win2k support for it. All I need is a proper uninstaller to get rid of all those stray reg keys. doh!<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zethris</div><div class="date">22nd March 2007, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">lol apparently micro$haft has done it again. They removed the Service pack, changed it to only allow installations on compact OS's and then released .net 3.0 which is just 2.0 and some extras (plus my dog gone uninstall fix! grr) But the catch is they conveniently (for them) made .net 3.0 only installable on winXP or newer! FhuttheWuck?<br />
<br />
blah! Oh well. Never mind I guess. However, if any of you do have a solution on installing a service pack (for anything) right after the initial install of something, I guess it'd be a good place to post it for search results purposes. But unfortunately it seems not possible with .net.</div></div><hr />
