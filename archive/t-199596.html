<br />
Well first off, thanks to all of you who have helped me build my first NSIS installer.  I'm getting ready to distribute my first update to about 150 customers on Monday.  <br />
<br />
My question is this, in the past when I was using DOS batch files to script my updates, I would thoroughly test them on XP, 2K, and 98 as DOS batch scripts often would behave very differently on each OS.  I have tested my nsis installer on each of these OSs, and have not found ANY irregularities between them.  Is this normal?  Should I be concerned for example that users of 98 (my PC is 2K, and therefore most of my testing has been on 2K) will have a un-foreseen side effect?<br />
<br />
Just looking for general ideas of differences of how nsis behaves on different OSs, thanks all!</div></div><hr />

and maybe different versions of DLLs or OCX Files<br />
<br />
I'm working on 2K too and built my Setup for 2K, XP and NT<br />
<br />
It worked on W98 too, but there was an error with a dll which didn't work on 98 because it wasn't compatible with other W98 dlls</div></div><hr />

Yeah I have only noticed a difference when using the ini commands, but other than that, everything seems to be consistent between OSs.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />
