I only want files contained in the EXE to be installed, not along with copying files that already exist.  Can this copying be prevented?  I can't find any reference to this 'feature'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 20:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people include files in the installer itself, that can be done using the File command.<br />
<br />
If you are using CopyFiles you should only copy the files you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bruegggw</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I wasn't clear.  My installer contains just the files I want installed.  I am not doing any copyfiles or any other command that I know of to cause this action.  If a customer has a folder called c:\temp that contains file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt, etc and they copy my installer into c:\temp and run the installer their original files are copiedtheir original files are copied to my install path.  To my knowledge, I never told the installer to make copies of c:\temp\file1.txt, c:\temp\file2.txt, c:\temp\file3.txt, etc. but they are copied.  I want to prevent them from being copied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please attach a script.</div></div><hr />
