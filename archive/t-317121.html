<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyrille</div><div class="date">18th February 2010, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear all,<br />
<br />
I am currently experiencing problem with my installation package created with NSIS Compiler V2.3. The problem has been identified only by a user with Windows 7. If the desktop and QuickLaunch shortcuts are well created, he has also noticed that the shortcut to the application is also created in:<br />
<br />
c:\users\Administrator.WIN-XXX\Desktop\<br />
and :<br />
c:\users\Administrator.WIN-XXX\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\<br />
<br />
where XXX is the real name of his Windows account.<br />
<br />
To create the short cut, I have used the following code:<br />
<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$DESKTOP\my_app.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\my_app.exe&quot;<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$QUICKLAUNCH\my_app.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\my_app.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it a bug with my code or something normal with Windows 7?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your kind support<br />
Best regards,<br />
Cyrille</div></div><hr />

with taskbar pinning nobody has a reason to go back to quicklaunch.Sorry, I disagree. I find QuickLaunch very useful in Windows 7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, the correct path should be \XXX\ (i.e. without the administrator.WIN). However, the person informed me that these shorcuts were created from a previous installer. The last one do not create these shortcuts. Everything is fine thus. Thank you very much and sorry.<br />
<br />
I am going to check the forum about the use of RequestExecutionLevel. Thanks again :)<br />

<br />
Probably a stupid question: I would like to know if RequestExecutionLevel defines the requested execution level of the install package (and thus the choice depends on the NSIS script) or of the .exe file of the installed application?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much<br />
Cyrille</div></div><hr />
