<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovespy108</div><div class="date">28th September 2007, 04:31</div></div><div class="posttext">At directory page:<br />
 Required Space : A KB<br />
 Available Space: B GB (A,B are numbers)<br />
__________________________________________________________<br />
  I changed the two lable's color: font colos is blue(also other colors),background color is TRANSPARENT.<br />
<br />
  In directory EditBox,I preset the directory to &quot;C:\xx\..&quot;(or &quot;D:\xx\..&quot;,and so on).Now I browse and choose the install directory to be &quot;C:\&quot;(or &quot;D:\&quot;,and so on).the first B overlapped with the second B(B is available space number).Then I choose any other directory,this time's B always overlapped with last time's.<br />
<br />
  When I minimize the dialog then come back to the dialog,the number is shown normally.Also,when I go back to front page then come back to this page,the number is shown normally.If I don't change the lable's color,it's shown normally too.<br />
<br />
  What's the reason?Maybe I expressed ambiguously.Hope you can understand.<br />
___________________________________________________________<br />
Another two questions:<br />
1.If the directory is &quot;C:\&quot;(or &quot;D:\&quot;,and so on),why the &quot;installation button&quot; cannot be activated?I want it to be activated.<br />
2.At the end of directory,it is added a '\' symbol automatically.That doesnot look well.How to remove it?especially tell me the way to remove it when I choose the direcotry with &quot;browse button&quot;.<br />

Thank you very muck...<br />

As that'd be a bit hard for those controls that change without your control, it'd be easier to pick a background color that fits best but is not transparent.<br />
<br />
Root directories are not supported by the installer by default. Use AllowRootDirInstall to override this setting.<br />
<br />
You can't remove the extra back slash. It's required when you select root directories or the directory would be invalid.</div></div><hr />
