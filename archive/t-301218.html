<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">whoops</div><div class="date">19th December 2008, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm new to this program and I was wondering how you would make it so that the installer would make a shortcut on the desktop after the files are installed.  I have searched around and I am puzzled on what to do.  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
I found this and I don't know what to do with it or where to put it...<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$DESKTOP\Program.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\Program.exe&quot; &quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">19th December 2008, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">just put it on a section<br />
<br />
...or if you are talking about a checkbox on the finish page (Using Modern UI), you would use a function callback, see the Modern UI docs for info about that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">whoops</div><div class="date">19th December 2008, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, All I need now is to know what section of what .NSI to put it in, Base or Modern. Also, I am just going to make it do it automatically so they don't need to check any boxes.<br />
<br />
I did say I was new to this right? haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">19th December 2008, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">you can simply use a section just for the creation of a shortcut<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Create Desktop-Shortcut&quot;<br />
   CreateShortCut &quot;$DESKTOP\Program.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\Program.exe&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
that way the user can enable or disable it, which is recommended<br />
<br />
also have a look at Sections (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter2.html#2.3.3) for further options</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should take some time and look at some of the examples that ship with nsis then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">whoops</div><div class="date">19th December 2008, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I figured out where to put it and makes the shortcut, but the shortcut doesn't work. When I click on it, it says that it can't find the file that its supposed to run.  I tried a few things like changing the directory and stuff but I don't know what to do from here.<br />
