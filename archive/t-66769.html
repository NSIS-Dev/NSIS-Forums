<br />
NSIS appears to work perfectly under CodeWeaver's WINE (CrossOver 1.0RC).  I was able to generate a Windows executable installer without any trouble.  You'd think it was native watching it run.  I wrote a little wrapper (/usr/local/win32/bin/makensis) around WINE and makensis.exe so I could call it without a bunch of nonsense.<br />
<br />
makensis wrapper script:<br />
#!/bin/sh<br />
wine.sh /usr/local/win32/bin/makensis.exe $*<br />
<br />
Some background:<br />
<br />
My goal here is to do automated nightly Win32 builds of a CVS repository under Linux.  I'm using MinGW32 (GCC) as a cross-compiler under Linux to compile code into (native MSVC) Windows executables.  Then running NSIS under WINE to generate the self-installer.<br />
<br />
I have been compiling using Microsoft Visual C++ 6 on Windows 2000 running under VMWare.  Then I'd run NSIS to package it up.  Using VMWare works great, mind you.  (Although not exactly cheap.)  Suspend/Resume in VMWare makes starting/stopping a Windows VM instantaneous; no need to ever boot/shutdown the VM.  (Well, there is still the dreaded 'you must reboot your computer' every time you install something trivial...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n_ick2000</div><div class="date">27th November 2001, 04:51</div></div><div class="posttext">If your good with linux, can you answer me a question that has been bugging me for a while. When I used to use linux (redhat linux 7.1) I would install wine and I could never find out where it installed it to. I think the reason I don't know is my general lack of understanding of linux. So if you could tell me exactly how to use wine, that would be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">augur</div><div class="date">27th November 2001, 06:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, WINE can be a bit tricky to make work correctly.  Not sure how much help I can be there.  I've installed from source with great success.  Only RPMS that ever worked were from CodeWeavers.<br />
<br />
Codeweavers' WINE is probably the easiest to use.  It's really as simple as &quot;wine myprogram.exe&quot;  Crossover has a wine.sh with it.  wine.sh does some sort of magic to determine how to call wine and makes sure wine-server is running.  The first Windows app you run takes a few seconds to start wine-server.  Once wine-server is up apps start instantaneously.<br />
<br />
Installation/Usage Info:<br />
http://www.codeweavers.com/technology/wine/download.php<br />
<br />
I'm using CrossOver 1.0 which integrates WINE with GNOME and several web browsers.  Main purpose of crossover is to allow you to load Windows Internet Explorer or Netscape plugins/helpers into Netscape, Mozilla, Galeon, or Konquerer on x86 Unix.  Crossover has an &quot;Add New Program/Plugin&quot; wizard.  You just click add, browse to the executable (e.g. setup.exe), then it launches the setup program or whatever.  I've installed Quicktime, WinAMP, Shockwave, MS Word/Excel/PowerPoint Viewers, etc this way.  These all run perfectly.  The program launcher icons show up on the GNOME Favorites menu right where they would in be in Windows Start Menu.  The desktop icons are put on the desktop.  They annoyingly steal your file type associations just like they do on Windows.  It's really rather well integrated.  ;)  Many apps won't yet work, of course.  But, the ones which do work run at native speeds and are very stable.  I suspect Lindows might go a long way to filling in the missing Win32 API calls in WINE.</div></div><hr />
