<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inmytime3021</div><div class="date">18th December 2007, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">(I am new to NSIS so do pardon me.)<br />
<br />
I simply want to hide a dialog window. I found several topics discussing in a round-about way, but nothing that directly/simply showed how to do this. In particular, I'm trying to hide the Finish dialog window inside .onInstSuccess.<br />
<br />
This is what I tried:<br />
<br />
Function .onInstSuccess<br />
;FindWindow $0 $HWNDPARENT<br />
;FindWindow $0 &quot;&quot; &quot;${PRODUCT_NAME} ${PRODUCT_VERSION} Setup&quot; 0 0<br />
;HideWindow<br />
<br />
FindWindow $0 '#32770'<br />
;FindWindow $0 '#32770' '' 0 $0<br />
<br />
ShowWindow $0 ${SW_HIDE}<br />
;ShowWindow $MUI_HWND ${SW_HIDE}<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
I cannot get any of these methods to work. Am I doing my ShowWindow line wrong? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Thanks for your help (again) :P.<br />
<br />
Well, I want to show the finish dialog.<br />
<br />
I'm running my SQL script once they click finish, and while it runs,  I'm using the NotifyIcon plugin to show a balloon in the task bar while the script runs. Then when complete, I show success or failure in my NotifyIcon.<br />
<br />
However, I discovered that if I call NotifyIcon (or anything else GUI-related), that my NotifyIcon doesn't stay in the task bar when the mouse hovers over - the only thing keeping it open is the baloon message. SO, I moved my code up to .onInstSuccess to fix that. I thus want to hide the dialog while it continues to run, keeping my NotfyIcon in the task bar. Then I tear it down after it completes. I thought it was going to be a slick'n'quick solution, arg!<br />
<br />
WHY doesn't this work?<br />
<br />
FindWindow $0 '#32770' '' 0 $0<br />
ShowWindow $0 ${SW_HIDE}<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th December 2007, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">That last piece of code doesn't work because you're trying to hide the internal dialog and not the whole dialog. Just use HideWindow which does all that for you.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's what I thought. I tried it earlier and didn't seem to work (so I thought) so I moved on to others things. However, when I simplified my code down and tried it again as you suggested, it DOES work. But for some reason, the window paints again once I call NotifyIcon and launch my script. I'm guessing NotfiyIcon is causing it. For example:<br />
<br />
<br />
Function .onInstSuccess<br />
  HideWindow<br />
<br />
  ;...build my script from input of my custom dialog<br />
<br />
  ;show our 'job starting' balloon<br />
  NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD &quot;fy&quot; &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\modern-install-colorful.ico&quot;<br />
<br />
  ;now run the script<br />
  ${LogAction} $CommandLine<br />
  nsExec::ExecToStack $CommandLine<br />
<br />
  Pop $0 # return value/error/timeout<br />
  Pop $1 # printed text, up to ${NSIS_MAX_STRLEN}<br />
<br />
  ${If} $0 != 0<br />
    ;show our job failure balloon<br />
    NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD &quot;.fb&quot; &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\modern-install.ico&quot; &quot;TraCS Data Warehouse Installer&quot; &quot;Warehouse job failed!&quot;<br />
    Sleep 4000<br />
  ${Else}<br />
    ;Use login method used by installer and read results from our job table(s)<br />
    ${If} $IsSQLLogon == '1'<br />
      StrCpy $CommandLine 'sqlcmd -Q $\&quot;SELECT BatchType AS Type, BatchTimeLapse AS [Time Taken], BatchAffectedRows AS [Affected Rows] FROM dbo.BatchStatus;$\&quot; \<br />
                               -d $\&quot;$DatabaseName$\&quot; \<br />
                               -b -r 0 -V 11 \<br />
                               -S $\&quot;$ServerName$\&quot; \<br />
                               -U $\&quot;$UserName$\&quot; \<br />
                               -P $\&quot;$Password$\&quot; -Y 13'<br />
    ${Else}<br />
      StrCpy $CommandLine 'sqlcmd -Q $\&quot;SELECT BatchType AS Type, BatchTimeLapse AS [Time Taken], BatchAffectedRows AS [Affected Rows] FROM dbo.BatchStatus;$\&quot; \<br />
                               -d $\&quot;$DatabaseName$\&quot; \<br />
                               -b -r 0 -V 11 \<br />
                               -S $\&quot;$ServerName$\&quot; -Y 13'<br />
    ${EndIf}<br />
<br />
    ${LogAction} $CommandLine<br />
    nsExec::ExecToStack $CommandLine<br />
    Pop $R0 # return value/error/timeout<br />
    Pop $R1 # printed text, up to ${NSIS_MAX_STRLEN}<br />
<br />
    ;display our initial success balloon<br />
    NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD &quot;.fb&quot; &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\modern-install.ico&quot; &quot;TraCS Data Warehouse Installer&quot; &quot;Warehouse job finished successfully!&quot;<br />
    Sleep 8000 ;sleep, for testing only<br />
  <br />
    ;now show our job results as gotten from out table (formatted)<br />
    NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD &quot;.fb&quot; &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\modern-install.ico&quot; &quot;TraCS Data Warehouse Installer&quot; $R1<br />
    Sleep 8000<br />
  ${EndIf}<br />
<br />
  ;now we tell NotifyIcon to destroy our balloon; we're done.<br />
  NotifyIcon::Icon &quot;r&quot;<br />
<br />
  end:<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry about the formatting and length. But I am finding that I should post or show the full logic in order for my scenario to make sense. So here it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th December 2007, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">You can attach script files to avoid formatting issues.<br />
<br />
This problem can be solved just like the other one. Create another installer, make it silent, make it use whatever pop-ups it needs and execute it from the main installer. This way, you'll have no dialogs to handle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inmytime3021</div><div class="date">18th December 2007, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion. I just might give in! I just can't seem to get it to work the way I want here otherwise. The thing is, I KNOW there is a way to do it given all the nifty abilities of NSIS (and contributions). I think it has something to do with the /NOUNLOAD with the NotfiyIcon plugin, or how it interacts with the dialog. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I'm just gonna write a quick bootstrap exe to do what I want: Then I have ultimate control. I'll leave NSIS to do what it does best: install stuff.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reminder, kichik. Your idea of splitting it off is gonna be the best approach.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />
