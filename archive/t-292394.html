<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamthelostboy</div><div class="date">28th May 2008, 03:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We have several software packages we create and market.  Our main software package has been using NSIS for a while, and it is working brilliantly.<br />
<br />
We market another package, which is actually a combination of a base program with some additional DLL's, and a Runtime Library.  These are currently delivered in 3 installers, plus an update installer.<br />
<br />
We first load the Runtime installer, followed by the installer for the DLL's, which automatically kicks of the main app installer off.  When the main app installer is finished, it returns to the dll installer.  All very confusing for our users.  Also, it's not so good for our branding, as none of the installers have our logos, information, or licensing agreements in them.<br />
<br />
I would like to combine them all into one NSIS installer.  The problem is I don't know exactly which files have to go where.  Does anyone know of a good program to watch the multiple installers, and give output (preferably an NSIS script) as to which files where installed, so I can them package it up.<br />
<br />
In the past, I have used Wises to do this, and I believe Microsoft SMS will do it to, though I don't think either of those give an output other than one of their installers.<br />
<br />
We would definitely prefer to use NSIS.  It's got great compression, an awesome interface for our customers, and we can keep our installers the same across all packages.</div></div><hr />
