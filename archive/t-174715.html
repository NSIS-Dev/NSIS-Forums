<br />
As horrible as it sounds, I hope it is something stupid, that makes me look dumb, but is an wasy fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">30th March 2004, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe $INSTDIR requires a certain .exe in the directory. also check if the path is correct, i remember having some problems with old scripts (&quot;C\Program Files&quot; instead of &quot;C:\Program Files&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">30th March 2004, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Or there is not enough space available on the current drive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbgCODE</div><div class="date">30th March 2004, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for all your help, but as an FYI, it has installed fine on about 70 other computers, from 98 to XP, just this one computer it didnt work on, is their a way to specify how much disc space is needed, or I should look into that.<br />
<br />
How would I say how much disc space is required for the install?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">30th March 2004, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The required and available disk space is displayed on the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbgCODE</div><div class="date">30th March 2004, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I understand that I meant, is there a line of code that I could put in the nsi file and that would become the required amount of space needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">30th March 2004, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">It automatically calculates that based on the size of the included files. You can modify it using AddSize.</div></div><hr />

Yes I understand that I meant, is there a line of code that I could put in the nsi file and that would become the required amount of space needed? You can loop over all selected sections and sum up their sizes using SectionGetSize.</div></div><hr />
