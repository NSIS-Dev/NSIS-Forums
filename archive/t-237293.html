<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeman48</div><div class="date">6th February 2006, 03:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have a program that I want to let users download but I don't want them to be able to install the program without a product key. Is there any way I can set up my program so that when the user clicks the download link the must fill out a form that then gives them a code which they input into the installer?<br />
Basically what I want to do is have the program somehow connect to my site and then confirm the key. Is this possible or should I figure out some other way?</div></div><hr />

As for contacting your server if you have a dynamic page (ie an ASP/PHP/Perl script) you can send a POST query with InetLoad plugin and the output will be downloaded to as a plain text file to where ever you want it to. This text file can then be read from with FileOpen, FileRead and FileClose.<br />
