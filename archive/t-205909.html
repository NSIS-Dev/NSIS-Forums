<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">charlies</div><div class="date">25th January 2005, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past, I have used InstallShield and it had a way to specify file overwrite by (VERSION | DATE) where a file would be overwritten if the new file had a greater version than the old file, independent of the date/time stamp. I assumed, wrongly I believe, that the 'SetOverwrite ifnewer' would take file version (if avaible) into account. Is there a simple way to ensure that a file is overwritten if the source file has a newer version than the destination?<br />

You can set &quot;SetOverwrite on&quot; - and it will be always overwritten. If file is blocked (by system, or currently is running) - installer will notify you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">charlies</div><div class="date">25th January 2005, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize that, but I only want to override if the file is newer. I would like the definition of 'newer' to be 1) first version 2) then date if necessary. If this does capability not exist, it seems like a nice feature that shouldn't be too dificult to implement. I am hoping, though, that I missed a simple mode/setting to accomplish my goal</div></div><hr />

You can use the Library  (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixB.html#B) or the older UpgradeDLL macro to do this comparison for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">charlies</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I have used those functions/macros primarily for updating system DLLs. I was just hoping that I missed some capability in the File command that would allow more control over overwriting files. It seems that I did not miss anything and will need to use something other than the File command to update my files.</div></div><hr />
