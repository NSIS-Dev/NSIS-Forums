<br />
awesome program - have been using it for some time now, solving sooo many problems. (And getting a lot of help by reading the forum...)<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
i have recently suffered a harddisc crash, which of course deleted my one and only copy of a big script/installer i had just finished for an assignment... (Amongst a lot of other good stuff)<br />
<br />
now my question is - is there ANY way (and i do mean any way) to somehow re-engineer the exe fil, so i can get the script out ??? - I only need the script which had a lot of customizing in it...<br />
<br />
ANY help would be very appreciated...<br />
<br />
thanx in advance....<br />
<br />
Jean</div></div><hr />
