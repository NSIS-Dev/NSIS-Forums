<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">26th April 2005, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that since SubSection was replaced with SectionGroup, SectionGroupEnd now takes up a section index slot.<br />
<br />
For example, if I have...<br />
SectionGroup &quot;Group&quot;<br />
Section &quot;Section 1&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
SectionGroupEnd<br />
...the last index (while looping through them before the error flag is set) should be 1 (Section 1's index). However, it's always 2...<br />
<br />
If I put some more sections after the SectionGroup, their index's are 1 more than they should be.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug or is it by design (for what reason?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">26th April 2005, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">It always took a section index slot. The section group end is marked using a section with the SF_SECGRPEND flag which used to be called SF_SUBSECEND.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">26th April 2005, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">That's interesting. I've never noticed it :o<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to check if a SectionGroup check-box is checked?<br />
<br />
This problem (with the SectionGroupEnd taking up a slot) came up while I looped through all Sections in a SectionGroup to check if all were unselected, and I'd always find this odd one at the end which wasn't actually a Section (which broke the code).<br />
I ended up putting a dummy section in to mark the end of the Sections group, but that isn't a very nice method.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could add a built-in SectionsCount define or something which refers to the highest section index.<br />
It's not a huge problem, but it might come in useful (I'd find it useful!)<br />

<br />
To check if a section group is selected or not, you can check the flags on the section group itself. If it's partially selected, the SF_PSELECTED flag will be turned on.</div></div><hr />

 SectionGetFlags ${PROG2} $R0<br />
 IntOp $R0 $R0 &amp; ${SF_SELECTED}<br />
