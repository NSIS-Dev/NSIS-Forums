<br />
For some reasons, my installer doesn't work on Windows Vista (french version). When I try to install my app to the default folder (c:\program files\app), I get this error for each file:<br />
<br />
Error opening file for writing: &lt;name of file&gt; <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if I try to install the app in a folder other than &quot;Program files&quot; then the installation works fine. Does anybody know what could be the problem? I assume it's not the UAC since it would display a message and not just silently block the installation, right? Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Laurent</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would probably check 2 things:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 make sure you are using RequestExecutionLevel admin to ensure that if UAC is enabled, the user's security settings are properly elevated.<br />
 You also may want to then check for admin access just in case the user has UAC disabled.  (maybe using something like this (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Check_if_the_current_user_is_an_Administrator)).<br />
[/list=1]</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was it! I had it set to &quot;RequestExecutionLevel user&quot; which apparently makes the UAC blocks the installation without providing any meaningful error message. By setting it to &quot;admin&quot; as you've suggested, the usual UAC mesage shows up asking for confirmation. Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />
