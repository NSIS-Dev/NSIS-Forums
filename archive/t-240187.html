<br />
I used until now InstallShield for developing installers. Now because we have to change our installer we decided to make an evaluation of different installers, including the latest version of Installshield with which I'm familiar (so this would be a + for IS).<br />
So, I am investigating now 4 installers but I have to tell you that every day I am more amazed by NSIS. Seems that once you get familiar with the script language you can really do whatever you want :) And it's free! It's really incredible! Keep up the good work guys! Really nice job!<br />

with the exception of 3d-egoshooters (even there i'm not sure about plugin possibilities): yes, you can :)</div></div><hr />

It evolved from a way of distributing Winamp plugins to one of the most popular scripted installer systems on the planet.  It's the Project of the Month on SF for January 2006.  It allows things such as a fully skinned UI (http://xpui.sourceforge.net) and maintenance system that automatically generates code based on your file list (http://xpui.sourceforge.net/compmgr).<br />
<br />
I'm convinced.  Are you?<br />

<br />
I've become a big NSIS-fan (though i had some little starting-problems - new language and stuff). But the greatest features of NSIS are you guys in this forum. And your philosophy.</div></div><hr />
