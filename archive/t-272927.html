<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">discipulus81</div><div class="date">16th June 2007, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only been using NSIS for a week now so I apologize in advance if this is really simple.  I am trying to create an installer that will set up new hires at our company with all the software they will need.  Basically I need it to create a temp folder, copy other installation programs from a network drive, and execute them.  I think I have everything figured out except being able to copy other executables from a network drive.  I know that I can include all of these executables in the installation but that seems like it would unnecessarily bloat the installation.  Also I saw a reference to a Inetc plugin that handles downloads from the net and ftp sites will this work?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
