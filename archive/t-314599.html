<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paradev</div><div class="date">14th November 2009, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">My NSIS compiled setup program halts during copy files on Windows 7. If I run the setup after change it's compatible mode to WINXPSP3, it continues copying files and successfully installed sometimes but not always.<br />
<br />
The problem is setup script halts all system and Windows also during executing below copy file scrcipt. (In the middle of copying file process, it stops everything. It contains about 200 MB with hundres of files.)<br />
<br />
    File /r &quot;${SOURCE_FOLDER}\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
Until Windows Vista, it was OK, but it failed with Windows 7 Ultimate. I tested with anther PC also and results in the same problem.<br />
<br />
I would like to know how to run my NSIS compiled setup file with/in &quot;WINXPSP3&quot; compatible mode. And if you can avdice me the reason or solution, it would be very helpful to me.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help in advance!<br />

<br />
You should try to find out why it fails... <br />
<br />
Do you have RequestExecutionLevel in your script?</div></div><hr />
