<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RDaneel</div><div class="date">18th September 2004, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">As the infamous 2.01 draws near, I wanted to check whether it included the latest LZMA SDK... I checked the changelog, and it doesn't seem to (there was an additional update of the LZMA SDK -&gt; 4.06 on September 5, which has a &quot;Minor bug in encoder's code was fixed&quot; annotation).<br />
<br />
The [slightly] larger issue that I see is &quot;where does one look in general to see the included version of NSIS's dependencies?&quot;<br />
<br />
I am calling the LZMA SDK a &quot;dependency&quot; for want of a more descriptive term - feel free to suggest one. :)<br />
<br />
For that matter, *what are* all of the external dependencies (those that have their own versioning) used by NSIS?  Off the top of my head, I don't know where to look... which is probably why I started this thread. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th September 2004, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS is not build against external libraries, all source code is modified. So there is also not a certain version of these libraries which is used.<br />
<br />
If there are updates in libaries which are relevant for NSIS, these things will also be updated in the NSIS source.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RDaneel</div><div class="date">19th September 2004, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Joost.<br />
<br />
So, the answer is to be familiar enough with the entire source codebase for NSIS to know what is of &quot;foreign&quot; origin, know where to check the current status/fixes of those projects, and then be able to look at the NSIS source to see if those latest updates have been integrated yet?<br />
<br />
Well, that *is* an answer... just maybe not the one I was hoping for. :)<br />
<br />
Now, about the fact that I *can't* check the current sources, between the snapshots (my preferred source for sources) not being updated, and CVS having problems... :(</div></div><hr />

Sometimes changes in external libraries are relevant for NSIS, sometimes not. Usually you'll find in the CVS changelog whenever source code from external libaries has been integrated.</div></div><hr />
