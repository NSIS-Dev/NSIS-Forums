<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emilsoft</div><div class="date">24th February 2005, 03:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I'm currently working on three different programs, one of which will be included in the instalation package of the other two. What I mean is this:<br />
<br />
A -&gt; One stand-alone Software<br />
B -&gt; Another stand-alone software<br />
C -&gt; Yet another stand-alone software<br />
<br />
Now, Product A's and Product B's installers will both include Product C as part of their installtion. What I want to do is for either setup program to check to see whether Product C has been previously installed, if not then install the software itself. They all use registry keys, so it's possible to detect them, but I don't know how. Is this whole idea possible to implement?<br />
<br />
Please keep it as detailed and step-by-step as possible, since I'm very new to this. :) <br />
<br />
Thanks.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glory_man</div><div class="date">24th February 2005, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Installation of product C you can make using one hidden section (inside section include write in registry &quot;installed-identification&quot; ):<br />
Section &quot;-ProductC&quot;<br />
...<br />
WriteRegStr &quot;..root_key..&quot; &quot;..sub_key..&quot; &quot;..name..&quot;<br />
...<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
In .onInit function you must detect if a product is already installed - read registry using ReadRegStr instruction. If value is present (product installed) -&gt; disable ProductC section (use SetcionSetFlags). If value is absent -&gt; enable this section.<br />
<br />
And include these code for both installers scripts.</div></div><hr />
