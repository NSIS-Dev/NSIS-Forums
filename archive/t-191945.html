<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrYpT</div><div class="date">30th August 2004, 23:50</div></div><div class="posttext">When I try to use the MUI_STARTMENU_GETFOLDER macro in the uninstall script without having displayed a startmenu page in the installer, it doesn't work. The question is not so much why, but rather, is there a MUI-style way to get around this or am I stuck using ReadRegStr?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrYpT</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 04:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Absolutely, I can use ReadRegStr, but what I was trying to do was !include my uninstaller script in both the base installer and an upgrade. The way I got it working used a bunch of redundant !defines in my base installer, some of which were gobbled up by the !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_STARTMENU and some of which were used later in the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
So yes, it works, but (this is just a suggestion so you're welcome to ignore it) it would be nice if there was an elegant way to handle this. For example, something like !insertmacro MUI_DECLARE_STARTMENU which would declare everything the page function does, without actually showing the page.</div></div><hr />
