<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">25th May 2002, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">At the request of Girdhari, I quickly put toghether a new background program in Delphi. It takes two arguments: bgfile and window title. Window title can be an empty string, then the titlebar disappears. The program scales a (preferrably large (so it looks nice on large resolutions too)) bitmap to full screen. A bitmap can be compressed a lot, so no problem there. But my Delphi exe is huge. Maybe someone can take this to C?<br />
<br />
A compiled version is too large to upload to this Forum but can be found on my homepage (including all source files).<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit1: I changed the source a bit to hide the taskbar button of the background window and to hide it from windows taskmanager.<br />
<br />
Edit2: changed again: made the taskbar disappear completely, so full screen installer.<br />
<br />
Edit3: made it ignore mouseclicks.<br />
<br />
Edit4: made extra option: hide taskbar or not.<br />
<br />
Edit5: changed taskbar behavior a bit.<br />
<br />
Edit6: added icon support.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is anyone actually interested in this program/utility. If not, I'll just stop developing it. Please let me know.<br />
<br />
Have fun with it, thanks for the effort, greetz,<br />

KiCHiK developed a nice bgutility in C and we are currently testing and improving it. It supports bitmaps, sound (Wave) and taskbar hiding. Coming improvements are mp3 support and scaling of images.<br />
<br />
The first version is already available at the website of KiCHiK: http://kichik.********<br />
<br />
You can post replies here if you want to make a comment on the utility or have some bug report.<br />
<br />
KiCHiK, thx for the effort!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th May 2002, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it is now almost ready. No more can't find dll (stupid != instead of == :D), but for some reason it can't delete the DLL after it finishes. I can't seem to find why it can't. If someone knows why please tell me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks to Balashanker NSISBGImage will have resizing support tomorrow. Unless someone has an objection to StretchBlt. I have never tried this function so I do not know if its algorithem is a good one, plase comment.<br />

[edit #2]<br />
Documents are now in Windows format.<br />
[/edit #2]<br />
<br />
[edit #3 by Smile2Me]<br />
At a request of KiCHiK, the attachment has been deleted since there where problems with the DLL that doesn't get deleted. You will be informed about any news about this program.<br />
[/edit #3]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">31st May 2002, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">That DLL not being deleted seems to be a more severe than just being a left behind :cool: ... Please consider this program as beta and don't distribute it with your installers. I have put my latest version of it on my site. Please help me identify the problem.<br />
<br />
If you don't see anything wrong with it just try running the installer a few times in a row... Just remember, Ctrl+Alt+Del contains shutdown option :D<br />
<br />
Damn hooks! They are everywhere!!!<br />
<br />
Oh btw, it can load JPEGs and GIFs now... ;)</div></div><hr />
