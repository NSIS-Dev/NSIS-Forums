<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">super-llooyd</div><div class="date">7th December 2005, 06:34</div></div><div class="posttext">- I tryed the Icon directive but that doesn't seems to work.<br />
Is it because I use the modern UI?<br />
<br />
- Also I would like to write a small exe to test for .NET presence (the current script is not good enough and I really don't feel comfortable enough in &quot;NSIS&quot; to improve it).<br />
If I want to call it, I have to unpack it (same for licence.rtf, BTW).<br />
<br />
Where should I unpack them (the licence file &amp; the test .NET exe) while the installation is not even started?<br />
<br />
- Also is there anyway to have a loop?<br />
let say I want to look at all the subkeys of a registry key entry. How do I do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">7th December 2005, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">It is really best to start of by trying the included NSIS examples to get a feeling forhow NSIS installers work. <br />
<br />
Also installing a NSIS script editor like <br />
<br />
http://hmne.sourceforge.net/<br />
<br />
Makes it a lot easier to learn.<br />
<br />
And of course, read through the manual, even if you do not understand it all, it will improve your understanding by already reading it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for considering NSIS. I know out of experience you can achieve all functionallity you requested in this post.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
