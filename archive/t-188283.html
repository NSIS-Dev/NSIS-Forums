<br />
 I've just realized that NSIS 2.0 release is quite old, it's been released in february and the changelog is long indeed.<br />
 I'd like to know if a current build of NSIS is ready for production (a big load bugs seem to be present in the 2.0 release)?<br />
 I have the same question for InstallOptions. An 'alternate' version called InstallOptionsEx appeared recently and I'd like to know if it can be seen as an upgrade to InstallOptions or not?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">InstallOptionsEx is in a beta version. NSIS is stable. I can't mix both of them under one now. I need to make IOEx stable first. Then you request its addition under NSIS. (Now I know how is to have a popular project)</div></div><hr />

 Thanks for your reply regarding InstallOptionsEx. Could you tell me please whicg version of NSIS do you use, the 2.0 release or some recent build?<br />
<br />

If not you have to wait until kichik release 2.01.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">memph</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Meanwhile I figured out that C:\Program Files\NSIS is a CVS enabled directory tree, so I've updated the tree :)<br />

<br />
It says the snapshot is updated many times a day, but yes the snapshot may not get updated until the end of a day perhaps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flizebogen</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You misunderstand. As shown in the CVS log the latest Code Change was 15 July but the makensis.exe is dated 15 May. Kickik don't compiles at every change therefore i have said that he has to wait until 2.01 gets out in case he don't  own a compiler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh. Then things have changed. It used to get updated very often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">But I know that the project moderators try to upload the binary edition at the same time the fix has been made in the source code. But yeah, sometimes they fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Somehow I think the Snapshot has been updated (yesterday infact).<br />
If you look on the Development page, it says:<br />
Download the latest snapshot<br />
<br />
Development snapshot generated Thu, 29 Jul 2004, 07:44:24 GMT<br />
<br />
When they add updates to the Snapshot, they may not have made changes to the compiler, but to plugins, examples, documents etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The snapshot is updated no matter what has changed in CVS. It's automatic. There have been some problems with SourceForge recenetly that caused it to not update but normally it should update at least once a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">memph</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys,<br />
<br />
 Since the makensis I've got created crashing installers even for example1.nsi and example2.nsi, I think I have to get back to 2.0 release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">You should always use stable releases unless you have a good reason not to do so. NSIS 2.01 is due out soon.<br />
<br />
Please give detailed information about the crash problems. Also make sure all source files are up-do-date and see the users manual for information about compilation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">memph</div><div class="date">2nd August 2004, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Joost,<br />
<br />
 The non-working NSIS version was a NSIS 2.0, updated via CVS to current. <br />
Since then I've downloaded the nightly link and it works fine.<br />
<br />
