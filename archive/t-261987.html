<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wacaveman</div><div class="date">18th December 2006, 03:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read several threads in regards to the use of execWait with parameters, I figured it out, but wow -- what a struggle.  What causes something which should be as simple as a system call forget that msiexec is supposed to launch an msi?  The ExecShell is smart enough to know...<br />
<br />
Funny enough, the following works:<br />
ExecWait &quot;$INSTDIR\install\Firefox_Setup_2.0.exe -ms -dd c:\usr\local\bin\Firefox -ira&quot;<br />
<br />
But if I change it to:<br />
ExecWait '&quot;${INSTDIR}\install\Firefox_Setup_2.0.exe&quot; -ms -dd c:\usr\local\bin\Firefox -ira', it stops working.<br />
<br />
Another feature request - make execution of external statements easier to use.  I blew 12 hours trying to make this work, much to my dismay.  At least it is working now.  I am sure the mystery of putting the quotes in the right place, and whether $WINDIR is supposed to be there or not throws a lot of people.</div></div><hr />
