<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">22nd January 2006, 06:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't get the installers compiled with NSIS 2.13 to run on Windows 95/98/NT.<br />
I always get the error:<br />
<br />
Error! Can't initialize plug-ins directory. Please try again later. <br />
<br />
The first problem I faced was trying to install the software using nsis-2.13-setup.exe<br />
I got the same error as above.<br />
OK, so I downloaded nsis-2.13.zip, unzipped and compiled some of the examples to test.<br />
Any installer which uses a plugin does not run on Win 95/98/NT.<br />
<br />
The problem does not seem to exist on Win ME and better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you. <br />
<br />
I got then same problem here, just tested with 98se &amp; ME, 98se got the same problem, ME is ok.<br />
<br />
Now I downgrage to 2.12 to fix this problem.</div></div><hr />

Quite annoying because I've tested this change mostly on Windows 9x and NT... I just never used the plug-ins :( I'll have to add some more automatic tests to the release script to test on Windows 9x as well.</div></div><hr />
