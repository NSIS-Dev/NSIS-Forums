<br />
Does anyone know of a good freeware / open source Windows Registry comparision tool.<br />
<br />
I have several exist installation files I have created using MS Package and Deploment Tool (Yuck!!). Add several driver .INF installations. I want to debug these existing installations and move to using NSIS. <br />
<br />
I want to be able to compare the whole registry before and after I run an installation. To check I understand how the current installation files work, and so I can check that my new NSIS installation works.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

There were a number of filtering options and such that made it fairly straight forward to find out what is going on.</div></div><hr />

I have tried to toa diff after exporting my registry. Unforunately my registry is 156MB when exported. I have tried both windiff and winmerge but both crah while comparing the files (I think they are just too big)<br />
<br />
Thanks CrushBug<br />
<br />
Great utility. But it seem to montior a few files and registry entries often, not the whole registry once. <br />
<br />
I am trying to move an exiting project from a wizard based installer to NSIS, I think I have found most / all of the registry entries the wizard installed generated, but I just what to be sure by comparing the registry before and after on a virgin machine.<br />
<br />
Thanks All.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">16th September 2006, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">156MB isn't so big.. try Total Commander's &quot;Compare Files&quot;.  You could also export different sections of the registry separately. E.g. HKLM separate from HKCU and such.<br />
<br />
That said - look up RegMon by SysInternals.  It'll monitor for any registry access.  Just start it, run the installer, stop it, then right-click and exlude processes/paths that aren't of interest at all, and you should be left with the interesting bits.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't do anything on a virgin machine with pre/post comparisons unless it is truly virgin (image from a fresh install of Windows/etc.) as a lot of uninstallers do -not- uninstall absolutely everything; so you'll never get a clean diff for a 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. install.</div></div><hr />
