I looked in Google for the Ximian icons in windows format and didn't see anything, but someone must have done this by now... right?<br />
<br />
Maybe for install use &quot;revert&quot; and for uninstall use &quot;delete&quot;.<br />
<br />
Revert:<br />

Delete:<br />

<br />
This should be perfectly ok to do since the icons are free.  The hardest part would be coming up with 16 color icons, but I doubt we'd need that these days.<br />
<br />
If I thought others would use it, or at least get it added to the contrib folder I'd do it myself -- eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirus</div><div class="date">25th November 2004, 08:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I'd add that when I came across the Ximian Icon Project (http://primates.ximian.com/~tigert/new_stock_project/) I was mainly looking for an uninstall icon, which would fit with either the &quot;delete&quot; or &quot;undelete&quot; icons.  However I was looking again and was thinking others might be good for install also, such as &quot;jump-to&quot;, &quot;book-open&quot;, and &quot;cdrom&quot;.  Maybe even &quot;import&quot;.  Not sure, but if I do eventually end up making the icons myself I'm not sure which would be best.<br />
<br />
Hmm, anyone know of a good yet free icon editor?</div></div><hr />

First hit when you Google for &quot;free icon editor&quot;..</div></div><hr />

Attached are ICOs of the icons you mentioned. Note that they are all XP format (24-bit with 8-bit alpha) because the original PNGs contained alpha transparency. All of the icons contain two sizes: 16x16 and 24x24. (stock_book_open.ico contains only 24x24 because there wasn't a stock_book_open-16.png)<br />
<br />
Let me know if you want any other icons from this collection. It takes less than a minute to create each icon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirus</div><div class="date">25th November 2004, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, thanks scrose, they look great.  On Windows 2000 it seems to ignore the alpha, but they still look better than the 16 windows color icons.  The Delete will be good for uninstall... hmm, maybe the stock revert would look more like install to disk if it were mirrored?  Thanks again.<br />
<br />
Hi RobGrant, actually I was asking for peoples' opinion on what was a good icon editor, not necessarily just a free one. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">storytrader</div><div class="date">1st December 2004, 05:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, I'd like to add some new (tray) icons to my WAmp 5.04.  Where are the .ico's stored - which folder?  Are there a few that I can download and add easily from somewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />
