http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=193392&amp;highlight=uninstall+AND+delete<br />
<br />
but that is to create a list of files at the time the installer is created.  What I need is a list of files that passed the ifnewer test at the time of installation, then they are logged to a file which is then read by the uninstaller and they are deleted on uninstall.<br />
<br />
I don't think this would be very hard and I could probably do it, I just thought I'd ask if anyone already has a script like this that they could post.<br />
<br />
Also integrating &quot;uninstalling only installed files&quot; into the base uninstaller might be a good feature to add as when searching for it a lot of posts came up, and honestly most poeple think this is how uninstall works by default, plus many other installers have this option.<br />
<br />
Another question, I created the following macro<br />
!macro FileLog dst src name<br />
File &quot;/oname=$SYSDIR\${dst}&quot; &quot;${name}\${src}&quot;<br />
!system 'echo Delete &quot;$SYSDIR\${dst}&quot; &gt;&gt; $INSTDIR\uninstaller.nsh'<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
But when called from the main section such as<br />
Section &quot;MainSection&quot; SEC01<br />
FileLog &quot;dst.exe&quot; &quot;src.exe&quot; &quot;Source Dir&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
I get the following error<br />
Invalid command: FileLog<br />
Error in script &quot;stdin&quot; on line 175 -- aborting creation process</div></div><hr />
