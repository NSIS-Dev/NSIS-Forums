<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmL</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I add a file while compilation with the file command. The File has a Format like PatchXYZ-12345.exe ... is it possible to extract the 12345 string while compiling and use it as a variable inside the script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't use it as a variable, since those operate at runtime. You can use it as a define (which operate at compiletime), but how to get the number I don't know. Perhaps make a bat file that passes both the filename and the scriptfile to the compiler? Not sure how to get a filename in a bat file either, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a look at the !searchparse (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter5.html#5.4.13) command. For your example, you would use it like# ${AFile} = PatchXYZ-12345.exe<br />
!searchparse ${AFile} PatchXYZ- Serial .exe Unused<br />
# ${Serial} = 12345I'm not sure how you are adding the PatchXYZ-12345.exe file to the compile, but if you would create a defined value for it, you can use that define in the !searchparse command without extra work.!define AFile PatchXYZ-12345.exe<br />
  File ${Afile}<br />
  !searchparse ${AFile} PatchXYZ- Serial .exe Unused<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;${Serial} was compiled&quot;<br />
<br />
  File &quot;AnotherRelatedFile${Serial}.txt&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmL</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe i told not clearly. I have File (it is only one) which is located inside a folder and which is added to installer while compiling ... maybe:<br />
<br />
c:\files\Patch12345.exe<br />
<br />
I add the file via this command line ...<br />
File c:\files\*.exe<br />
... to the installer.<br />
<br />
How can i &quot;scan&quot; for the one filename inside c:\files and extract the 12345 from the File and put it inside a variable while compiling the script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll probably need an external program to do this, as there are no NSIS commands that can do this as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The wiki has an example showing how to call an external program when you compile your NSIS script:<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Invoking_NSIS_run-time_commands_on_compile-time<br />
<br />
The external program generates a file which is used when the main NSIS script is compiled.</div></div><hr />
