I'm trying to get it to open up .zip files, but it won't do it.<br />
<br />
ExecShell &quot;$3\$2&quot; SW_SHOWNORMAL<br />
<br />
<br />
The file it is targeting is correct.<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">3rd May 2003, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks it worked.<br />
I'm trying to get the program now to go in a loop, so that when the user clicks Next on the last page, he is directed to the First page of the program.<br />
Is there a way to do this with 2.0b3, or would I need to download the latest cvs version?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">3rd May 2003, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you writing an installer of something else? NSIS just works like a normal wizard, so that's not possible with normal pages.<br />
<br />
A possibility is to use InstallOptions for all pages and call the InstallOptions commands in a loop. Or you can launch your application again when it's finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">3rd May 2003, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Since my program takes ages to load up (it downloads a list of updates, puts them into a drop list, filters them and so on) I resorted to this:<br />
<br />
When the user clicks next on the final page, it will write &quot;1&quot; to an ini string, runs itself again, and then quits.<br />
On the oninit function, I simply check if the figure is &quot;1&quot; in the ini file, and if it is &quot;1&quot; then it skips all of the oninit function and loads up the first page immediatly as if it just went back.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have a command like this:<br />
GotoPage x<br />
<br />
Where x is the Page order in order of Page commands.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">3rd May 2003, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, all pages are IO pages, so that might be a possibility.<br />
I want it split into different pages right now, since each page has lots of things built into them.<br />
<br />
I'll get back onto it tomorrow.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">4th May 2003, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. I now have 1 single page function full of all the different IO pages. Now, however, it compiles it thinking that because I only have 1 page, it has that one last page as the final InstFiles page (It's an IO page, but its treated as if it is an InstFiles page). The cancel button on it is blanked out, and I cannot get off the program. The close button in the corner just makes it move through the IO pages.<br />
<br />
Does that mean this isn't possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Add a feature request for GotoPage if it's not there yet. It'll work with the new flags optimization I am going to implement. For now you'll have to call your installer again when it's finished as been said in another post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I resorted to having it re-open the installer on-click of the Next button.<br />
