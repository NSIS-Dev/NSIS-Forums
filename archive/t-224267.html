<br />
Could someone help me with that? :-) cheers.<br />
<br />
also, u see my installer is like this. I'm trying to delete/uninstall everything that's been installed on logout/reboot.<br />
<br />
I don't noe how to do that yet so i'm asking ppl to uninstall it manually. but it doesn't delete the parent folders.<br />
<br />
i tot of doing it manually by deleting the parent directories regardless of where it was installed but that's pretty scary cuz some of my users install it to the desktop!<br />
<br />
so need help. lol..<br />
<br />
TIA. :D<br />
<br />
not talking about the &quot;problem&quot; with nsis 2.08 though... well, not exactly. :p</div></div><hr />

Back to the problem, more details are still needed. The script would be very helpful. Which Windows version you're testing on would also help. For example, RMDir /REBOOTOK won't delete directories on reboot on Windows 98.<br />
<br />
As for e-mail notifications, you won't get them unless you login. If you can't login because you didn't get the activation e-mail, I'll need your login name to send you another one. If you didn't even register, that's the problem. Guests can't get e-mail notifications.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anywayz, basically, i want to delete everything that i created during the install process. if it wasn't created during the install process, then i don't want to delete it.</div></div><hr />
