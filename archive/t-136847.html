<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolwyn</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't want the Start Menu Program Group to display, I just want to force it, as the uninstaller isn't smart enough to keep tabs on where things are installed (see a previous post for details).<br />
<br />
So, now I'm getting on compile:<br />
Unknown Variabel {MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE} not defined, ignoring... or whatever.<br />
<br />
How can I disable a user from changing a strictly defined Start Menu group? Do I even need to define these things?<br />
<br />
Also... now one of my issues is I'm trying to customize the DirText, and have READ the entire ModernUI readme. It is not clearly enough defined for a new(er) user of NSIS what command/definitions SUPERCEDES the DirText command from the Classic Interface.<br />
<br />
What do I define for MUI to change the DirText without re-defining it later, causing a warning?<br />
<br />
The uninstaller for NSIS really needs some work.<br />
I can't get the uninstaller to be in one place, yet uninstall files in the $INSTDIR folder unless I place the uninst.exe explicitly in the $INSTDIR root.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the start menu program, I don't see where the problem is. If you do not want the user to change anything, then don't display the MUI_PAGE_STARTMENU at all.<br />
<br />
Place all the code related to creating your shortcuts in a section whose name will begin with '-' .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the uninstaller, you can always write a registry key in the installer containing $INSTDIR and then read it from the uninstaller. This behavior is by design, allowing users to move installed products and still have uninstallers work. It's also this way to avoid NSIS automatically writing unwanted registry keys.</div></div><hr />

Changing the topic title as it's a bit inappropriate.<br />
<br />
Oops. Can't edit it now. :) Feel free to edit the topic title.</div></div><hr />
