<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">union</div><div class="date">1st November 2011, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello!<br />
<br />
First of all sorry for my poor English.<br />
<br />
I need some identifier in the installer, which can be changed directly by editing the exe-file (as it will occur on the server).<br />
<br />
I tried to add in installer text file containing a string of &quot;XXXXXXXXXXX&quot; pointing to his &quot;SetCompress off&quot;. When I open the installer in the hex-editor, I find this line in it, but if I change it, the installer will not run.<br />
<br />
Anybody can help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">1st November 2011, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">This didn't work, because generally modifications of the installer EXE occur due to download errors. And NSIS uses a CRC check to detect corrupted (modified) installers. You could work around this &quot;problem&quot; by disabling the CRC check, BUT THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA. Instead you could try to append some additional data to the end of the EXE file, after it has been compiled by MakeNSIS. I would assume this additional data (&quot;overlay&quot;) is not covered by the CRC check. You could then open the EXE file for reading via FileOpen and $EXEFILE. As the size of the EXE file is not known beforehand, you don't know the exact seek position where you'll find your data. Instead you will have to add some &quot;magic number&quot; in front of the data. Then you can scan through the file via FileReadByte until you have found the &quot;magic number&quot; (and thus the desired data). Maybe start the search at some offset in order to speed-up the process...</div></div><hr />

I think my problem is solved. I will use the ReadCustomerData function.</div></div><hr />
