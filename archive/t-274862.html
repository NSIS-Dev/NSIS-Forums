<br />
I was wondering if it was at all possible to package up something for distribution using NSIS, but at runtime somehow &quot;inject&quot; or &quot;add&quot; a variable that could be used by the scripts inside the package.<br />
<br />
What i am trying to achieve is distribution of the software, with a dynamic affiliate advertising ID added to it somehow.  This would save me having to package a NSIS installer for every combination of advertiser etc.<br />
<br />
I have had the idea of adding some bytes to the END of the nsis installer, and i believe the installer could probably fetch the pathname of itself, open itself for reading, skip to the end and extract the advertiser information.  It could then store this in the registry.<br />
<br />
But i am thinking that I can't be the first person in the world that ha had this problem, maybe i am overlooking a more simple solution?<br />
<br />
All i want to do is embed some kind of runtime variable with the NSIS installer.<br />
<br />
help!<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />
Steve</div></div><hr />
