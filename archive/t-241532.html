ZipDLL (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in) and NxS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nxs_plug-in) or Banner (see NSIS Help) might be what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry Japanese will become english day after day. Just point your self in NSIS documentation and NSIS Examples (they are bundled with the installation). Browse The main NSIS site (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) to find script editors and other usefull stuff, the site also has many examples as well as this forum. Coming to the forum be sure you'll grab the answer to every possible question you might have.<br />
Im such a noob! But i love it, and i will eventually figure it out...<br />
Just go ahead and smash the nutshell!</div></div><hr />
