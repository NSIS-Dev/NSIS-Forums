What are the most common (or biggest) problems you had with your product's installer from a development point of view?<br />
<br />
As for myself, I think one of the most frustrating things is that installation issues are &quot;suddenly&quot; discovered too late in the dev cycle. I've been working over a decade in installation development, and as part of my studying of installation design, I am collecting whatever people could share about their experience in this field, working towards practical solutions.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate if you could share you thougts.<br />
thanks,<br />
Andy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">msroboto</div><div class="date">22nd March 2010, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Windows is my biggest installation problem.<br />
<br />
I guess I should be specific.<br />
<br />
My biggest issues arise from Microsoft causing unintended consequences to patches.<br />
All of my issues typically involve installing SQL Server Express.<br />
<br />
I currently have about 4 specific items in my installer to mitigate issues caused by the SQL Express installer being stale and updates causing issues.<br />
<br />
1.  NEVER install SQL Server Express on XP with service pack 2 this can cause the machine to go into a never ending reboot loop.<br />
<br />
2. During some update Microsoft causes an issue that results in the SQL Express installer not being able to install MSXML6.  http://sqlblog.com/blogs/aaron_bertrand/archive/2009/02/20/the-xp-sp3-msxml6-sp2-sql-server-debacle.aspx<br />
This fails the SQL Express installer.<br />
<br />
3.  SQL Express requires a newer version of Windows Installer.  See #1 but since we can no longer install on SP2 I guess this is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
4.  I have encountered machines that do not have the C++ redistributable.  SQL Express requires it.  I must provide it myself or the install will complete but SQL Express service will not come up.<br />
<br />
As we look to SQL 2008 we see other issues that I have not worked on solving yet.  I'm sorry the specific error escapes me right now.  I expect SQL Express to remain the bane of my installation for sometime to come UNTIL we remove it from the product.<br />
<br />
I expect that will be the fix moving forward to go to a lighter database for the clients.</div></div><hr />

I must provide it myselfthat's a general case for anyone when compiling &amp; installing Windows apps as to how/what crt dependancy you're working with and how it is dealt with. though most of the times the issue is coming from the developer for not checking what they're doing (too many times i've seen debug versions of the crt linked to in production setups which then causes load failures on most machines).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">msroboto</div><div class="date">23rd March 2010, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup.  I agree.  I am specifically referring to the fact that SQL Server requires this but will happily install without it.<br />
<br />
This requires me to deal with the deficiencies of that installer.</div></div><hr />
