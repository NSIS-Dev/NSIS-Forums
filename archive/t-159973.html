<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I had 4 defines set up for my script (created when I was still using the 2.04(CVS) version). After upgrading to 2.0b4 and installing the 14 Dec (20:44) snapshot, I could still compile my script using MakeNSISW (on a Win98SE system).<br />
<br />
Today I tried to use MakeNSISW to change one of these 4 defines. When the 'Settings' window appeared, the Symbol List was completely empty (but it had a vertical scroll bar so I could scroll up and down this empty list!) I tried typing in the name of the symbol I wanted to change and its new value but it did not appear in the symbol list. When I tried to compile my script it failed - all I got was the makensis usage message.<br />
<br />
When I looked at HKLM\Software\NSIS\Defines I found that the new MakeNSISW had destroyed the existing settings.<br />
<br />
Instead of finding just 4 defines like this:<br />
<br />
HKLM\Software\NSIS\Defines\<br />
(Default Value) (value not set)<br />
0 &quot;NAME_1=A&quot;<br />
1 &quot;NAME_2=B&quot;<br />
2 &quot;NAME_3=C&quot;<br />
3 &quot;NAME_4=E&quot;<br />
<br />
I found there were 22 empty entries plus one with the new value:<br />
<br />
HKLM\Software\NSIS\Defines\<br />
(Default Value) (value not set)<br />
0 &quot;&quot;<br />
1 &quot;&quot;<br />
2 &quot;&quot;<br />
3 &quot;&quot;<br />
...<br />
...<br />
21 &quot;&quot;<br />
22 &quot;NAME_4=E&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried deleting all other entries and using MakeNSISW to rebuild the list but it keeps generating extra empty entries (the number varies).<br />
<br />
However if I use RegEdit to create the entries, MakeNSISW manages to read them properly and compiles my script.</div></div><hr />

iceman is currently busy so I'd have to do this myself. I hope I'll get to it tomorrow or even today.</div></div><hr />

As far as I am concerned it is a minor problem and easy to work around so I don't mind waiting for a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th December 2003, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Fixed.</div></div><hr />
