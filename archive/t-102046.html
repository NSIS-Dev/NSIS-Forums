Click here for a screenshot! (http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/nsis/NSIS/Examples/Modern%20UI/Screenshot.png?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=image/png)<br />
<br />
To use this new UI, grab the lastest version of NSIS 2 pre-alpha 7 from CVS. You can find more information and an example script in the &quot;Examples\Modern UI&quot; directory.<br />
<br />
If you find any bugs, language errors or whatever, please tell me so I can fix 'em before the release of alpha 7 :)</div></div><hr />

You're right about the brandingtext sizing, i'll see wheather there is anything I can do about it. I cannot find your first problem (with the colors), can you reply to my PM?<br />
<br />
A start menu selection can only be made using InstallOptions, maybe I'll design a dialog for it.</div></div><hr />

As you said earlier the only way to have a start menu folder selection is by using installoptions, maybe you could at least simplify the process (of adding the start menu folder selection). I was unable to properly integrate it with this new modern UI, i ran into problems with the text on top &quot;the words like Choose....&quot; and so on...one such example is if you move to the next section (selecting a start menu folder), then move back (selecting the location / install path), then the text on top would be wrongly displayed...stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

Ok after some checking i made a big mistake - i modified the example.exe from modern_ui.zip itself ! (how stupid of me)...i didn't realise it was an installer and NOT the UI itself (although it did have the UI in it)...i'll make a fixed copy rightaway</div></div><hr />

It you want to modify the UI, it's better to modify Contrib\UIs\modern.exe instead of creating an installer which contains the dialogs.</div></div><hr />

Well the installer does include a modified version of the modern.exe, just that it includes an installer like the one in modern_ui.zip.</div></div><hr />

It seems that the trimming doesn't &quot;trim&quot; that well, it leaves a small amount of gap (can be considered quite big), here's an image :<br />

For some reason, the rectangle along the top of my installer is showing empty, but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  I'm using modern2.exe from the alpha7 download at SF btw.  The screenshot should show the prob I'm having <br />
You need to include some macros in your script to get it to work.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the Examples\Modern UI directory.</div></div><hr />

It's impossible to make a 16-color icon in this style. I'll add the classic 16-color icons for systems with 16-color icons. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This new version has Install Options integration! It's now very easy to use Install Options in your Modern UI scripts by using the new macro's. Have a look at Examples\Modern UI\InstallOptions.nsi. :)<br />
<br />
The macro systems also contains some other changes &amp; fixes (see the changelog in Readme.html), you will need to make some small changes in your scripts to use the new header file.<br />
<br />
You also need the latest NSIS 2 CVS version to use Modern UI 1.20.<br />
<br />
If you have no cvs access you can download a snapshot with installer of all NSIS files at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nsis-snapshot-sep22.exe</div></div><hr />
