today i want to test my installer and the compiler brings up an error:<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
lots of files<br />
...<br />
Internal compiler error #12345: error mmapping file (2141109114, 1009288) is out of range.<br />
<br />
Note: you may have one or two (large) stale temporary file(s)<br />
left in your temporary directory (Generally this only happens on Windows 9x).<br />
<br />
<br />
when the error occurs, he has copied (?) about 5 gigabytes of data and 29.576 files and 897 directories. total amount of data is 7,38 GB.<br />
when i compress the whole thing i hoped to get at the end one 2-3 gigabyte file, cause with winrar and strongest compression level i reach 2,7 gb.<br />
<br />
what can i do now to get this thing work. i can't delete some files. unnecessary are already deleted.<br />
<br />
and one &quot;m&quot; of &quot;...mmaping....&quot; above is too much. but that's triviality.<br />
<br />
i've cleared my temp folder and drive c: has 20 gig's of free space which should be enough. and i'm not running out of space anywhere on my harddisks, if the compiler doesn't save it temporarly on c:\.<br />
<br />
is there a known limit? can im compress my files with winrar and let the installer decompress it i.e. with &quot;UnRAR for DOS&quot; or what else?</div></div><hr />

You can use one of the available solutions like CABSetup (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/CABSetup_plug-in) or an external archive with 7z.exe or some other archiving tool.<br />
<br />
The first &quot;m&quot; of &quot;mmaping&quot; stands for memory and should be there.</div></div><hr />
