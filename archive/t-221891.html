<br />
I am the developper of UltraModernUI, a new user interface with a style like the most recent installers for NSIS, I have just release a new plugin for NSIS named skinned button which allows to skin all the buttons of your installer. It's based on the wansis plgin of saivert.<br />
It was developed with an aim of integrate it in the next version of UltraModernUI (version 1.0 beta 2)<br />
<br />
You will find on this French forum a topic relating to it with some screenshots:<br />

<br />
I have several errors of linkage.<br />
<br />
I also tested with the last version of CoolSB but, it is worse.<br />
<br />
But if not, that would have interested me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gutenberg</div><div class="date">11th August 2005, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks very promising, except that there's an annoying bug preventing from using it for &quot;serious&quot; job.<br />
<br />
Every time we switch from one installer's page to another (by hiting the next button for instance), the entire desktop is refreshed.<br />
<br />
The final user experience is that:<br />
1/ the Desktop always disappear for a good second, and then painfully redraw itself (uh?)<br />
2/ switching from one page to another takes 1 or 2 seconds (basically the time for the desktop to redraw itself) which makes the installer feel like a Java application :eek: <br />
<br />
I guess there are some wrong API call that makes the root of all windows (the desktop) to be repainted whereas only the NSIS current window would really be needed.<br />
<br />
Hope this is fixable :) <br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, how is UltraModernUI b2 dev going? I can't wait to see all the improvements :cry: (can we have a &quot;beta preview&quot;, please, pleaseeee :D )<br />
<br />
Keep on your good work.</div></div><hr />
