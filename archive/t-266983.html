When the installer starts up it goes through these steps to select the interface language:<br />
1. Get user's default Windows language<br />
2. Find a perfect match for the language<br />
3. If there is no perfect match, find a primary language match<br />
4. If there is no match, use the first language defined in the script (make sure your first language is a common one like English)<br />
<br />
I don't see how this could be misinterpreted but maybe I've done it.<br />
<br />
My problem is:<br />
In my script I load English.nlf and Croatian.nlf but although the default language on my system is Croatian, $LANGUAGE always gets English.<br />
<br />
This would pose no problem if I was using LangDLL but due to nature of my 'installer', I don't want the user to select the language, I want it done automatically.<br />
<br />
I achieved this by getting user's lang. ID through system plugin and setting $LANGUAGE manually. Now everything works just fine.<br />
<br />
So why am I posting this?<br />
I want to know what it is that I'm failing to understand. Croatian lang. ID is 1050, ID defined in croatian.nlf is 1050, kernel32::GetSystemDefaultLangID() returns 1050... so after I load croatian.nlf why does the installer decide that Croatian is not a perfect match?<br />
<br />
The script is attached if anyone is interested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use the following in .onInit to get the old behavior.System::Call kernel32::GetSystemDefaultLangID()i.a</div></div><hr />
