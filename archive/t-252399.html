<br />
 rename &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\portwarn\pw.gif&quot; &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\pw.gif&quot;<br />
<br />
I've tried using the whole extension instead of $PLUGINSDIR... I did read somewhere that if the folder is already created it doesnâ€™t work? I'm not sure but I thought it would work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Potz</div><div class="date">1st August 2006, 20:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok as or right now I have both that exist... I was just wondering if I had to have it create a folder also.  For some reason mine isn't working when I try to move the file.  It is really frustrating because I can't seem to find a solution.  I think the way I have it is correct but for some reason it just isn't working.</div></div><hr />

You must first delete or move away the second file.  <br />
<br />
Is there no way to use rename if the second file exists?  I am trying to use rename to rename a file if it is in use so that copyfiles can copy the file to the install directory.<br />
<br />
The logic would be:<br />
<br />
Try to copyfile from temp folder to $instdir<br />
if error then<br />
   rename file in $instdir (e.g. from test.dll to test.bak)<br />
   try the copyfiles command again<br />
end if</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">1st March 2007, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You can check using IfFileExists or LogicLib's ${If} ${FileExists} and act according to the file existence.</div></div><hr />

If a file is in use.. it can't be renamed, moved, etc.<br />
You'd have to kill the process that has it open<br />
LockedList (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/LockedList_plug-in) by AfrowUK works great.<br />
<br />
As for moving vs. copying:<br />
i try to move first, as i find it's faster, but if source dir &amp; destination dir are on different drives, it will fail.. simply add a test. If it's a file.. you can rename across different drives.<br />
<br />
	${GetRoot} `${_SOURCE}` $5<br />
	${GetRoot} `${_DESTINATION}` $6<br />
	${If} $5 == $6<br />
	Rename `${_SOURCE}` `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	${Else}<br />
	CreateDirectory `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	CopyFiles /SILENT `${_SOURCE}\*.*` `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	${EndIf}<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to add another check for errors:<br />
	${GetRoot} `${_SOURCE}` $5<br />
	${GetRoot} `${_DESTINATION}` $6<br />
	${If} $5 == $6<br />
	ClearErrors<br />
	Rename `${_SOURCE}` `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	IfErrors 0 +3<br />
	CreateDirectory `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	CopyFiles /SILENT `${_SOURCE}\*.*` `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	${Else}<br />
	CreateDirectory `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	CopyFiles /SILENT `${_SOURCE}\*.*` `${_DESTINATION}`<br />
	${EndIf}</div></div><hr />

Not true, some files can be renamed even when they are in use.<br />
<br />

<br />
NTFS junctions/mount-points probably breaks this ${GetRoot} trick (Not a problem if you check for errors and fall back to a copy)</div></div><hr />
