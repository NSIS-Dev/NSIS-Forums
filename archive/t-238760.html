<br />
just firing a few question in the hope to move onto this neat installer... :)<br />
<br />
1. Is there a way to create an MSI package or only exe?<br />
<br />
2. where can I find the full syntax/commands etc besides the few exaples?<br />
<br />
3. Is there a way to run an NSIS installer in some sort of local/network admin mode so that we can push small installations via the loginscript without the need to give the user admin rights?<br />
<br />
4. can I add vbscript into the installer or execute them with some sort of execute command?<br />
<br />
I'm supposed to do repackaging of software to silent installations for an app deployment system so I guess this installer would do the job aswell if well scripted?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any returned info!</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. NSIS.chm<br />
<br />
4. Use Exec/ExecWait/nsExec<br />

NSIS creates an Exe, imho an exe is better than a msi, because you don't have to think about different msiexec versions on the target systems<br />
<br />
on 3rd Q:<br />
<br />
 try to use nopey (you find it in the NSIS Wiki) with the runas command<br />
<br />
you can set the user and pwd with a parameter,<br />
so this should do what you want<br />

Many Antivirus and/or so-called &quot;Security&quot; software prevents execution of scripts and batch files.  Not saying it won't work for what you are trying to achieve, but something to be aware of...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">7th March 2006, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You can put the via NSIS created &quot;Install.exe&quot; in an custom action inside an almost empty MSI package. It is a heavy quest to get this working. I've done it but there is NO easy way to explain this procedure. Dive deep into MSI with ORCA first I would say.</div></div><hr />
