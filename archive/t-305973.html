<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IYIaster</div><div class="date">2nd May 2009, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to do a silent install of Java. I'm able to do this with a bat file using jdk-1_5_0_11-windows-i586-p.exe /s /v&quot;/qn&quot; but I really don't like using a bat file and it takes a long time 2-5 min. Is there anyway for me to do a silent install of Java with NSIS not using nsexec? If I use the nsexec is there a way to show the user during that 5 minutes that something is happening and it hasnt froze? If there isnt a way to speed it up is there a way to make the bat file not come up and the nsis installer to show some kind of progress. If the install just sits there for 5 min the person using the install might think it has froze. <br />
<br />
I would prefer the nsis to do the silent install of jave. I've tried doing a execwait with a /s /qn /v and nothing works. I would also like the nsis to show that the installer is working. is there anyway to do this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
ExecWait '&quot;path\to\installer.exe&quot; /s /qn /v'</div></div><hr />

If I could get nsis to install it in silent mode then I would try to find a flag for the progress bar. But, I can't even get nsis to do a silent install of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IYIaster</div><div class="date">3rd May 2009, 01:40</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I finally got java installed going thru the installer by using this command    ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\jdk-1_5_0_11-windows-i586-p.exe&quot; /s /v&quot;/qn&quot;' The last thing would be how to get a progress bar. anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">3rd May 2009, 03:15</div></div><div class="posttext">you would have to ask the java guys for the real answer, but you could also try looking at http://unattended.sourceforge.net/installers.php Looking at that page, the first thing to try would be ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\jdk-1_5_0_11-windows-i586-p.exe&quot; /s /v&quot;/qb&quot;'</div></div><hr />
