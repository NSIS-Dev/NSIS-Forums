Has anyone compiled the sources with Lcc-Win32 yet? Can that person help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">26th July 2001, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't even compile it with the freeware turned shareware C# and C++ editor Bloodshed Dev-C++.

I can't compile the source with it. It produces some *.obj files, but I can't link them to an exe file. The obj file of exehead is not created, because of many errors.<br />
Or can anyone give me an makefile for nsis 1.44, so that I can compile it easier with the Borland C++ compiler?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">28th July 2001, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The Source already has a MakeFile file. if you don't have it, then I will be glad to send it to you.<br />

Minor patching required, though. ;)<br />

But I have a problem. I used the makefile under the msdos box under win95 and bcc32 compiles the sources into the *.obj files. But the *.obj files are not linked together, because the commandline is too long.<br />
Here the complete error message:<br />
ilink32 -v- -jzlib -Gn -q -ap -B:0x400000 c0x32.obj build.obj exedata.obj<br />
makenssi.obj script.obj tokens.obj util.obj adler32.obj deflate.obj trees.obj,<br />
 makensis.exe,, cw32.lib import32.lib,, script1.res<br />
Fatal: Command arguments too long<br />
<br />
Please help me.</div></div><hr />

I think I read a long time ago that the MSDOS command line has a limit to how much it can hold, but batch files don't.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, IANAP (I am not a programmer :p C++ anyway ), and it may be the ilink32 program that has issues.<br />
<br />
This link may be of some help...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">6th August 2001, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Have anyone used the VCtoBPR.exe (or gui version: VCtoBPRu.exe) to convert the Visual C projects file makensis.dsp to Borland C++Builder Project, and tried to compile then? I did but errors happened. In my opinion, borland and microsoft should be language compatible. They use the same run time libraries (except VCL). But still there is errors, hmm... I think Borland should consider be more MS Visual C frindly and think about all those who share code with each other. (I know I'm crazy when talking about MS friendly, but hey.. they got a good programming utility that is 100% compatible with the platform we are forced to use).</div></div><hr />

What compilation options you've used? ZLIB needs to be compiled with -DEXEHEAD -DWINDOWS -D_WIN32 flags ...<br />
<br />
BTW, I've tried my makefiles under win95 and everything worked fine (I'm using freeware BCC 5.51).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Disassembler</div><div class="date">7th August 2001, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I also use free BCC 5.51, but the makefile does not work (even when I installed the two updates), because it says &quot;command arguments too long&quot; (as with the makefile of makensis). I have to link the *.obj files with a batchfile, but with exehead it does not work (I can link the *.obj files of makensis). I think I have used the same params the makefile uses, but I will do another try. If I am not sucessful I will post another message.</div></div><hr />

Now, I have compiled the whole program. Many thanks to all who have helped me.  :-)</div></div><hr />

I went to the link and it changed. It doesn't have that many features to it. I think that is why you are having troble with it. If it were a bigger bundle, then you might have no problem, but this only offers you one item when the other versions have more items for the compiler. I really want to learn C++ as well as create my own Operating System (mmmmm, Linux). I don't think this compiler is for me. Sorry. :)<br />
