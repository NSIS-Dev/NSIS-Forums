<br />
I was just checking this site: http://www.gridnetworks.com/download <br />
And i downloaded and installed their software. I saw a couple of things that was interesting 'bout the UI used in the installer:<br />
1) It had a dialog box for entering admin username and pass if i tried to install as a non-admin. How do you get that dialog box ?<br />
<br />
2) The installation progress was a very modern and pretty UI. How was that made possible? Was it some MUI2 stuff working here? I dunno, any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

I can't run it, because I get an error message immediately. It says not enough free diskspace and then it exits. I never get a chance to choose install directory! And there are 500 MB free on my C: drive (Windows) and there are 6 GB free on my D: drive (Programs). That should be enough, eh? Really bizarre installer. They need to fix it!<br />
<br />
2. What makes you think that installer was made with NSIS? This looks more like an InstallShield Wizard installer to me...<br />
<br />
:confused:<br />

InstallShield:<br />

Well if this isn't nsis (as zeeh3 also points out) then i guess we dont need to discuss this installer's anatomy further. And yeah i didnt realize it didnt ask for install location...that sucks pretty much although it installed on my d: which has program files.<br />
<br />
Heres what i saw stepwise on my machine when i was a guest user:<br />
1)<br />

<br />
2)I try installing as a guest user:<br />

<br />
3)Error to install(obviously):<br />

<br />
4)The installer then restarts and now i add admin information:<br />

<br />
5)The pretty part of the installation:<br />

<br />
How can we give a similar dialog box(in 2 and 4) to the user in nsis? This can be helpful in the way that user wont have to logout/switch user etc to admin account to install the thing. <br />
Thanks LoRd_MuldeR for the info \m/</div></div><hr />

Is not part of the installer, its a part of windows (Windows will try to detect installers by looking at the filename, contains &quot;install&quot; or &quot;setup&quot; etc.)<br />
<br />
So, name your installer with one of the keywords in the name, or use the UAC plugin</div></div><hr />
