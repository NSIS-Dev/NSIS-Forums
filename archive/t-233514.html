<br />
I am using NSIS to package and distribute product selection &quot;Guides&quot; in PDF format. This means we'll revise the &quot;installer&quot; (we are calling it a &quot;downloader&quot;) each time we publish a new Guide.  <br />
<br />
One of the options I'd like to have is to be able to display a Flash video while files are downloading in the background.<br />
<br />
What's the best way to accomplish this?  If the answer is I need a Flash plug-in, is there someone who would be willing to write one for me, for pay, and if so, how much?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks.  But isn't that blocking?  IOW, doesn't it wait until the user is finished viewing before it moves on to anything else, such as downloading content in the background?</div></div><hr />

If you save the PDF with no so advance features you can emedd a third party opensource reader by installing the reader on the fly.<br />
<br />
Consider also to make the PDF to RTF and open with wordpad.</div></div><hr />

I've created once a Flash pluging for NSIS, it is however not opensource and not available for 3rd parties.<br />
<br />
Some tips:<br />
<br />
* Used Delphi to create the plugin<br />
* Since I got the handle of the installerwindow, this helped positioning the plugin window on the same spot and size of the installer<br />
* http://www.flashplayercontrol.com/ will speed your developemnt<br />
<br />
I'm sorry , but since I'm a busy guy, I cannot help more by providing a opensource plugin.</div></div><hr />
