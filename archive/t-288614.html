<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anonymo</div><div class="date">17th March 2008, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a typical installer that, when installing and a version of the application is already installed, tells the user to reboot for all changes to go in effect. <br />
<br />
The user can just acknowledge the message and then reboot whenever they like. Occasionally when I reboot, toward the end of the shutdown portion, I either get a tcsd_win32.exe or Rtvscan.exe error message. <br />
<br />
I double checked these processes (NTRU Cryptosystems related process on many dell computers and Norton respectively). They seem legit and my laptop isn't infected with anything according to several scans using various Antivirus software [much better than Norton].<br />
<br />
A few other people occasionally get similar error messages when rebooting after trying the application and a reboot is required.<br />
<br />
I wanted to make sure it was isolated to the nsis ONREBOOT so I rebooted my computer several times and only got the error messages whenever using a Delete /ONREBOOT or whatnot.<br />
I've never gotten these error messages before now.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this issue before?<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
