<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgillespie</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a requirement to make a install that requires no user interaction (based on a commandline paramater).  I have noticed that MUI is broken slightly in the latest CVS.  I have reproduced this problem by making minimal changes to the MUI Basic.nsi, and it still exhibits the same behaviour.<br />
<br />
The problem is, is that when we bypass the Welcome page (by using page abort), the InstallFiles page has no header or subtext displayed.  I have included the basic.nsi script that exhibits this problem.<br />
<br />
To reproduce, use this script, it will include all the files in CWD, and anything below it, make sure there are some largish files, so you get a large install (and thus enough time to see the problem).<br />
<br />
When you run the compiled setup normally, it's fine, if you run the compiled setup with the noreboot commanline, you will notice the install files page has no header or subtext.<br />
<br />
Is this a NSIS/MUI problem, or have I done something wrong???<br />
<br />
Script is attached.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ramon uploaded a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgillespie</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  Can I suggest a feature enhancement. Perhaps as well as having the silent install, having a semi-silent switch.  i.e it shows the progress dialog, but that's all.  We use this to distribute a large NSIS install from within a larger installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You can check for a command line parameter and skip the other pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgillespie</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I already do, but if NSIS were to be able to do this for any install, by perhaps different levels of silent switch.<br />
<br />
/silent<br />
/nointeract<br />
<br />
or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think this is something many people need and it can be written using the script language.<br />
