<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexin</div><div class="date">28th September 2011, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using EclipseNSIS on my desktop to generate a Windows installer and it worked perfectly. Recently this task has been delegated to a server running Jenkins and there are some problems.<br />
<br />
The installer generated by Jenkins is several MB's smaller than it should, even though the set of files to package is (roughly) the same. After looking at the log of the task, provided by the server, I verified most of the files aren't mentioned, unlike the log from my desktop which displays each and every file of the source directory.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea why some files would be excluded like this?<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help,<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You should use individual File instructions for each file. If there are files missing on the server (which there must be) then you will know about it then.<br />
