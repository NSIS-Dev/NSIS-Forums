<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">24th July 2002, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">is it possible to read every line of a textfile and use every entry in a string?<br />
<br />
what if this requires more than twenty strings? can i reuse the same string name later.<br />
<br />
i want nsis to read lines of a textfile and use the lines for further actions (lets say messagebox for instance)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th July 2002, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Like you said, there are only 20 strings available, and NSIS max string length is 1024 (the default), so no, you can't save the whole text file in memory if it has more than 20 lines.<br />
<br />
Why can't you process line by line and just save the lines you need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">29th July 2002, 06:00</div></div><div class="posttext">well, thats what i asked for. maybe you could post the code to report every line of a text file in a messagebox.<br />
<br />
i think it should be possible with just one string, but i am bad in strings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you, stuck in house while Sandy blows through,<br />
improving a few things in my coding.<br />
and this code helped tremendously.<br />
<br />
you and Afrow UK are the only ones i've seen that actually help.<br />
most waste their time patronizing.<br />
that time they wasted, they could've just created a quick example.<br />
something i don't understand.<br />
<br />
thank you to you and Afrow UK.<br />
You guys are very generous, <br />
Bless you guys.</div></div><hr />
