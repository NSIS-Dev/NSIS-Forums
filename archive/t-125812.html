<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PhracturedBlue</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we still have one minor annoyance with our installer:  After finishing all install steps, the progress bar is only 2/3 across the window.  I am most likely doing something dumb, but I can't find any documentation on how the progress-bar gets updated, so I don't know where to begin.<br />
<br />
Could someone enlighten me about how and when the progress bar changes its %-done?<br />
<br />
btw:  we are using ModernUI with modern2.exe, if that makes a difference.<br />
<br />
If you want to see the .nsi, it is located at:<br />
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/sc2/sc2/build/win32_install/<br />
but it requires a dynamically generated .nsh file too.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
When using Return in a section it won't advance the progress bar to the right position because it won't skip the instructions that come after that return statement. What you need to do is put a done label at the end of the section and jump to it.<br />
<br />
BTW, you should put a !echo &quot;Adding content removal...&quot; message when including content.nsh. I was sure it got stuck somehow because it took so long on my busy computer :)</div></div><hr />

You didn't actually need to download the whole CVS repository, i would have been happy to provide my content.nsh file, had I known you'd need it.  In any case, thanks again, I have fixed the problems, and added the echo as you suggested.  I'd just like to reiterate how pleased I am with NSIS, and the people on these Forums have been extremely helpful.</div></div><hr />
