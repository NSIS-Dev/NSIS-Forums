<br />
    I'm new to NSIS and I'm sorry for asking this stupid question, but I really have no idea about how to discover which files should I pack with the .exe one. <br />
<br />
   I'm a linux user and, on linux there is the ldd command, wich lists the libraries a executable shares, but how do I know this for a windows program, in order to pack the files with the .exe? Say I write a program in Delphi, for instance. Wich dlls does this Delphi program use?<br />
<br />
   Could someone point me some reference or answer me this question?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help, <br />
Jaú</div></div><hr />

Try Resource Tuner (http://www.restuner.com/) or PE explorer (http://www.heaventools.com/).<br />
Although, you don't need to add the main Windows APIs :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Lobo Lunar mentioned it is a really a very bad idea to include the files that windows installs itself.  As they are different for each version of windows and copying the wrong one would seriousely screw up your PC.<br />
<br />
Otherwise good luck and if you want to know which files to include, simply post the dependancy list and one of us will help you out. :D <br />
