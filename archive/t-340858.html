<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erundil</div><div class="date">19th January 2012, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on an update for a language pack. The old team is long gone and my only co-worker is just a translator, so I have no access to source codes.<br />
<br />
The problem is - I have to run an exe during instalation. It modifies a file about 1.7 GB big in an unknown way (since I have no source code and can't view a file this big with Notepad++).<br />
<br />
If I run the exe myself, just double-clicking it, everything goes fine in any directory.<br />
If I move both exe and big file to desktop, it also works perfectly using ExecShell.<br />
If I try ExecShell in the original directory (C:\Program Files\...), the exe file reports, that it couldn't access a file to modify.<br />
<br />
So any ideas what's wrong? If I run that exe from Program Files myself, it works just fine. Something about admin rights?<br />
I tried setting RequestExecutionLevel to both admin &amp; highest, but it didn't help.<br />
<br />
Also - I've noticed the same problems with ExecWait and Exec. All of them fail in Program Files subdirectories.<br />
<br />
Just an amusing fact - I tried InstallShield installer, set the exe to &quot;Run when installer closes&quot; (checkbox on the last page) and it worked ok, overcoming execution restrictions.<br />
But it's not an estetic way to let user uncheck execution of mandatory operations, so I'd rather look for a NSIS-based solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">19th January 2012, 05:37</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all: Program Files is a protected directory. You need administrator access to modify files there.<br />
<br />
Second: requestexecutionlevel does nothing on WinXP and earlier, or when UAC is turned off in Vista/7. You need to use the UserInfo plugin to verify that the installer has admin access.<br />
<br />
Third: Perhaps you need to set the working directory before you execute? Use SetOutPath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erundil</div><div class="date">20th January 2012, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks, it helped. I didn't even have to use the plugin.<br />
<br />
It was just setting the proper outpath...<br />
<br />
The problem was that I installed the exe to $INSTDIR, then SetOutPath to $INSTDIR\videos<br />
<br />
I had no idea, it could mess things up, so thanks again. :)</div></div><hr />
