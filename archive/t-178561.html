<br />
I don't know why people want to give a link to their homepages if they don't last forever, I already saw communities losing important files that were done very well just by this stupid thing. Is why I think that is better unify all files into one Archive than all in several.<br />

<br />
I don't think any homepage will last as long as sourceforge - you get free storage, why not use it and provide a link to your page to check for the latest version?<br />
<br />
Ah well, all's well that ends well. Thank you!!!!!<br />

I could do it someway, updating manually the update info file and creating a program to use this info to update your current plugins, but I don't have that kind of time for it. Maybe someone maintaining the Archive could do it...</div></div><hr />
