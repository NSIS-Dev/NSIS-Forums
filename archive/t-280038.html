<br />
My java application's requirement, is that i can't assume that the user has the proper jre installed, so i have to provide a proven one, in my nsis installation package.<br />
<br />
I know there are script's that can check the existence of the specified jre, but that's not the right solution for me.<br />
 <br />
I want one in my installation folder, and the application would use this one only.<br />
<br />
Can i do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It's up to Sun to decide if they want to allow you to do this. Technologically, it's very possible. So long as you don't include the browser (Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) plug-ins, it's just a matter of including javaw.exe, the DLL files and the JAR files.<br />
<br />
But you should make sure you're licensed to do this first. Besides the legal issues, you should also consider security. If Sun fixes a security issues in Java, you will have to release a new version of your program.</div></div><hr />

All what you need is to make an excutable file (using JSmooth) to launch your application with the java.exe from the bin folder.<br />
<br />
N.B. It is allowed legally to embed the VM in your application. just read the readme file in the main folder.</div></div><hr />
