I need to make my setup with admin execution level on ly if some files aren't already installed.<br />
But I see there's no way to change the RequestExecutionLevel in a section.<br />
I read about UAC plug-in, is that safe to use.<br />
Can it be what I really need?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance<br />
bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">28th May 2008, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">RequestExecutionLevel is embedded in the executanle manifest so there's no way to change it at runtime without a plug-in.<br />
<br />
I haven't used UAC plug-in but it should do the job and is definitely safe. Anders is a good guy. :) <br />
<br />
Edit: I read the UAC plug-in page and it might not work after all. :confused: <br />

I'm trying to integrate the UAC plugin but it's not very clear to me how to use it.<br />
Basically I just need to elevate to admin only if some files are not present, to then be able to copy them in restricted folders.<br />
<br />
Is it possible with UAC plugin? <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe it would be better to just embed a little installer with admin manifest that installs those files and call that from your main installer</div></div><hr />
