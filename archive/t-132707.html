<br />
I have a quick question,  i have developed a Script with NSIS version 2.0 b2<br />
<br />
We have noticed that after a installation, when we are starting different apps the MSI Installer keep kicking off and trying to install past installations which have been installed under a different account?<br />
<br />
As any body this seen before!, i also have attached my Script to make sure i am coding correctly<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
Carl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd April 2003, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it has to do with the fact that you are calling the installations of all of those applications with Exec and not ExecWait. When you call them with Exec the installer won't wait for them to finish and thus a situation where the second installer/application is called before the last installation has finished.<br />
<br />
It is also possible that the different account you have installed on didn't have administrator privileges and so was not able to install the application for all of the users but only to itself.</div></div><hr />
