<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xiceburnx</div><div class="date">3rd February 2004, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted regarding this issue a few weeks back, and though everyones' replies were very helpful, the problem has moved on.<br />
<br />
A developer cites that there was a problem with NSIS 1 not being able to uninstall properly from the Windows &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; menu. He mentions that Winamp 2.9 - which was distributed in a package built by NSIS 1 - exhibits this problem and there is nothing that can be done about it (this is all according to him, btw).<br />
<br />
Even if this case, I don't see why he is using an older version of NSIS. But my opinion remains that this is too stupid of a bug to have slipped through without a workaround.<br />
<br />
Was this really an issue in NSIS 1? Looking at the uninstall regkey for the application in question, it simply seems to be a matter of renaming the uninstaller file. The actual uninstaller is called &quot;uninstall.exe&quot;, but the regkey (created during the installation done by NSIS) points to a file called &quot;uninst.exe&quot;. Would this not be solvable by simply correcting the filename in the installation script?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Add/Remove programs entry it not even related the the NSIS executable itself, it's just a simple registry key.<br />
<br />
So you are right, it's the filename in the script that is wrong.</div></div><hr />
