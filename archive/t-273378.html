<br />
I'm creating the custom form for my installer. The form contains the combo box. The value is checked after it has been selected and another field should become invisible. I tried to perform following call:<br />
<br />
    WriteINIStr &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\myform.ini/&quot; &quot;Field 10&quot; &quot;Flags&quot; &quot;DISABLED&quot; <br />
<br />
But it doesn't work. The element is still active. Then I tried to put the value in the text box. I used this code:<br />
<br />
WriteINIStr &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\myform.ini/&quot; &quot;Field 4&quot; &quot;Text&quot; &quot;111111111111&quot; <br />
<br />
The element was not changed. But when the value is requested with using of ReadINIStr then it is received correctly.<br />
<br />
Is it needed to refresh the form in someway? I tried to find it in the documentation, but I could not. I saw only how to read values, but it is not said how to change form in the run-time.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
Eugene.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also a similar example posted at wiki,<br />
