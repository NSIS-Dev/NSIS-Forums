<br />
Im new with this excellent tool.<br />
At this moment I use InstallShield and its allows me to make many things that I also imagine with NSIS I could do it but actually Im not how.<br />
The question is, there is a way to obtain some REAL installer with all the options available like being multilanguage, licenses and readme depending on the selected language, several options of installation, creation of different directories, adding data in registry, to create .ini or not depending on if it exists, installation of runtimes, registering of OCX, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks In Advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boyito</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I Do<br />
But all this samples are separated, and I need all the things I write above in one single installer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Just give 'em a try and come back to this forum to ask about. Everything that you seek above, NSIS can do it! You'll see why one should leave IS behind and step ahead to the next level! (NSIS)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is enough information in the samples and documentation. You should be able combine the different things in all of the different examples yourself without any trouble. There would be nothing extra to learn from an example showing how to do everything at once.<br />
<br />
<br />
The examples are seperate for clarity on how to use all of the functionality without confusing the user, I would imagine. If there was just one big example that did everything, you would have trouble following which parts of the code are to do with what... with seperate examples you can see how each process works individually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">6th December 2006, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">TIP:<br />
<br />
Look at the wiki where the list is of some realworld applications that use NSIS.<br />
<br />
Then look which ones are opensource apps<br />
<br />
Choose an app that look like yours a little <br />
<br />
Go to this app's site and download the source, this will also include the NSIS installer script source.<br />
<br />
Sneak peak.. and learn from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
...but as stated before by others, combining examples with wiki code and you will get your script ready quite quickly.</div></div><hr />
