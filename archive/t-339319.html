<br />
For creating a sharepoint deployment I need to check if the SharePoint is installed on the user's machine or not. For this I checked the registry as follows :<br />
--&gt; readRegStr $0 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Web Server Extensions\14.0&quot; &quot;Version&quot;<br />
--&gt; MessageBox MB_OK $0<br />
<br />
As on a machine where I am checking this has SharePoint installed but still the $0 returns blank.<br />
<br />
When I tried to check other installations with the same method as above I was getting some value in $0. I searched a lot on the net but couldn't get any other way to do this.<br />
If SharePoint is not installed on the machine then in Shared Tools, Web Server Extensions will not exists.<br />
<br />
 Am I doing it wrong to check SharePoint installtion? Is there any other way to check this?<br />
Please provide me with some solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards,<br />
Mayur Mahajan.</div></div><hr />
