<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">firefrog</div><div class="date">8th September 2009, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Our own Customers report that a binary &quot;xxx.exe&quot; is moved in the virus vault by Norton AV on Windows XP and Vista. I don't no the version of the signaturefile.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The binary does just grant full File Access (Windows ACL) to another File of our own software after installation. It was build with the NSIS-Installationframework (http://nsis.sourceforge.net) with the AccessControll-Plugin. <br />
 <br />
The codelines in the NSIS-Installerscript, where the xxx.exe is build from, are looking like these one:<br />
 <br />
AccessControl::GrantOnFile &quot;$4\${ACCESS_DIR}\${ACCESS_FILE}&quot; &quot;(S-1-5-11)&quot; &quot;FullAccess&quot;<br />
 <br />
The TargetFile is situated in c:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\ and in c:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\<br />
 <br />
My Question: Does Norton AV declare ALL activities granting full Filepermissions as heuristic virus? Is that the reason cause our binary is marked as virus?</div></div><hr />

They usually just have false positive signatures created by their automatic systems. You should report this Norton fix prompt resolution.</div></div><hr />
