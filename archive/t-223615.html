<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skhatri</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 06:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I Am Sunil, and I am new to Null Soft installer. Previously I was working in MSI technology in Installshield. <br />
<br />
I have 2 problems :<br />
<br />
1. I want a to append a new string in English.nlf file <br />
# ^Text1<br />
&quot;SomeTextHere&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I tried using this string Text1:<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;.mov\shell\import&quot; &quot;Desc&quot; &quot;$(Text1)&quot;<br />
<br />
But this doesnt work.<br />
<br />
As I want to use this $Text string in my script. Is it possible ? Basically I want that all strings, which I am adding in my installer script, should not be hard coded in script, they should be in some file (Like *.nlf file), so that it is easy to localise the application.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.<br />
<br />
Say I declare a variable :<br />
Var Path<br />
StrCpy $Path &quot;C\\Program Files\\AAA\\BBB\\CCC\\DDD\\FFF&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I pick files, which are located at the same base path :<br />
<br />
File ${Path}\\ppp.exe<br />
File ${Path}\\GGG\\HHH\\uuu.exe<br />
File ${Path}\\III\\JJJ\\KKK\\gggg.exe<br />
<br />
But this too doesnt work. $(Path) doesnt get resolved to exact path, it has. Why so ?<br />
Basically here, I dont want to hard code Path. Whenever I want, I should be able to change the path with changing it only at one place.<br />
<br />
Please help,<br />
<br />
Sunil.</div></div><hr />

-2 File is a compile time command, use a define (ex: !define Path &quot;C\\Program Files\\AAA\\BBB\\CCC\\DDD\\FFF&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skhatri</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 07:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot Anders !! I understood the second answer. But I dint get the first one. You wrote that I should use LangString. <br />
<br />
For example :<br />
<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;English message&quot;<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_DUTCH} &quot;Dutch message&quot;<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_FRENCH} &quot;French message&quot;<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_GERMAN} &quot;German message&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the problem in this is that, while developing script, I dont know all languagee translations, so I will write some junk text in all locales, other than english. <br />
<br />
And when one has to localise the software, he has to look through script and has to find out, which strings should get localised. <br />
<br />
What I want that all strings, which are being added and should get localised, should be altogether in a file, and that file, we should be able to get localised. Localisation ppl, has only see that text file. And through script I should be able to pick up those translated strings.<br />
<br />
Can you please give me any example ?<br />
<br />
Thanks once again,<br />
Sunil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">you could keep the translations in a seperate script (which you can distribute) and !include it to your main script. that's how i do it, have a look at this (http://download.berlios.de/xpy/lang_english-0.8.13.zip).<br />
<br />
i'm not sure if you can use an external ini-file (readinistr) for your translations, you probably cant define a langstring on runtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MÃ¦ster</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to include localized strings after compilation (during run time) things become more difficult. <br />
<br />
But if you just want to have a single &quot;language file&quot; which could be easely localized and compiled in your installer than you could export all language strings in an extra file, lets say &quot;languages.nsh&quot; which looks like:<br />
<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;English message&quot;<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_DUTCH} &quot;Dutch message&quot;<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_FRENCH} &quot;French message&quot;<br />
LangString Message ${LANG_GERMAN} &quot;German message&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then you easely include 'languages.nsh' in your installer script:<br />
<br />
!include &quot;languages.nsh&quot;<br />
<br />
You could give the languages.nsh to the translators and after it came back you include the new language and recompile the script.</div></div><hr />
