<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KingRufus</div><div class="date">1st May 2001, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Does NSIS support any means of giving an NT/2k user the option of installing for the current user VS installing for all users?  I'm thinking that if there is not built in support, I might be able to make two different &quot;sections&quot; (since my program does not otherwise utilize sections, one for current user, and one for all users, but then again, this would only be applicable on NT machines, and I wouldn't know how to detect that within NSIS?  <br />
<br />
Anybody know a solution? (any knowledge of how the RegKeys differ for current VS all users would be helpful for me too)..<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like my program to open the &quot;Start Menu/Program Files&quot; Group that I create in my installer, right before it exits, then BringToFront the NSIS so they can hit close. (It's nice for a user to have something in front of them to do after they've installed software and as far as I know NSIS does not allow the option for &quot;Launch Program..&quot; on the last step) - I can exec the folder, or even execwait &quot;explorer.exe FODLER&quot;, but the problem is that returns immediately, so to make sure NSIS comes on top again I have to user a bunch of NOP's then (a couple) BringToFront.  <br />
<br />
It's a working solution but I thought there might be something nicer since it seems very common.<br />
<br />
-Thanks!</div></div><hr />
