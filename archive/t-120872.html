<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pozix604</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the following piece of code in a my script file:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;My Section&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
  File AutoIt.exe<br />
  Delete AutoIt.exe<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Intuition tells me that this will copy the file AutoIt.exe into the destination directory, and then delete it again.<br />
<br />
It extracts the file just fine, but never deletes the file.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug?<br />

<br />
If I use &quot;delete $INSTDIR\AutoIt.exe&quot;, then the command executes properly.<br />
<br />
Which sort of begs the question of why the installer doesn't try to go to $OUTDIR or $INSTDIR by default to delete a file which doesn't have a full path specified. <br />
<br />
Does this not make sense?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a Windows API call, so NSIS doesn't really have a lot of control with the delete.  I guess NSIS could attach directories to the files with no path, but then it would just be guessing as to what you really meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Rainwater, I agree with you, but I also agree with pozix604. Just like 'File AutoIt.exe' assumes that you mean the directory set with 'SetOutPath $INSTDIR', so should 'Delete AutoIt.exe' assume that eighter, I think :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually pointed this problem out to KiCHiK on IRC about a week ago but to be honest there is a known workaround and there are more urgent things for him to be doing :) Rest assured he's aware and I'm sure if he gets a chance it will be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the best way will be making SetOutPath set the current directory. I will have to ponder on this one a bit, it can create quite a lot of problems. But, as Sunjammer said, it will be fixed sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th February 2003, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Pondering done:<br />
- SetOutPath now sets the current directory (RegDLL no longer does)<br />
<br />
Find it in the latest CVS version.</div></div><hr />
