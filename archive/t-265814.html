<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinoseer</div><div class="date">14th February 2007, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello there everyone in the Nullsoft Brain Trust...I figure I would come to the source of the problem, which is your install system and it's incompatibility with many users' computers...<br />
<br />
This concerns my VERY recent problem with Nullsoft Scriptable Install System errors with nearly every executable I attempt to download...<br />
<br />
Something is very wrong with y'alls new fangled install system and y'all need to find the solution and quick...<br />
<br />
I will tell you what the solution is NOT...<br />
<br />
blaming your flawed code on a virus, malware, spyware or any other imagined scapegoat...<br />
<br />
I can download and execute anything based on the windows or unwise installers...<br />
<br />
blaming your flawed code on my firewall...I can download ANY other type of data i.e. .zip, .flac, .shn, .jpg, .html, .wav, .rar and I have no problems of any kind...I daily use ftp with no problems whatsoever...<br />
<br />
I am running windows 98 (not SE, but your code is supposed to work on Win 95, which I highly doubt)<br />
<br />
y'all are killing me here with trying to upgrade or try new software written with NSIS...I have researched and tried every 'blame it on something else' scenario... <br />
<br />
Every variable has been eliminated with the exception of an error in your code...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">14th February 2007, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS is free and open source, you may check the code line to line and post here the part of the code that you believe it produces errors or whatever malicious.<br />
<br />
Being free and very popular, there isn't way to control who uses NSIS and how, for instance virus, malware and spyware producers they are able to download NSIS and pack their crap with it.<br />
<br />
Regarding to your firewall, probably you try to download executables and the firewall blocks them, did you ever downloaded an NSIS installer packed in a zip, or did you ever try to download a well known trusted application like Mozilla Firefox which is packed with NSIS?<br />
<br />
Yes NSIS is compatible with Win 95 but there is the possibility a plugin that is used to extend NSIS capabilities to cause incompatibility problems.<br />
<br />
Also it's possible you're referring to NSIS Media which is a potential dangerous software that uses the name NSIS to fool users, see here for more details,<br />

Hello there everyone in the Nullsoft Brain Trust...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Every variable has been eliminated with the exception of an error in your code...  <br />
And yet, after all that you fail to describe the actual problem you have with the NSIS installers. If you want to get your problem solved, some info about the problem is necessary. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I have also tried some NSIS installers on Win95 and they worked OK too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe the dinoseer brain trust doesn't work too well, or maybe you just imagined it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">15th February 2007, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">PLZ provide an URL of an installer you downloaded and does not work.<br />
<br />
I offer you I will test it on unpatched W95A, W98, W98SE clean install on a sloooow 300MHZ machine and see if I can reproduce your findings.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is assuring for you to know I've created installers with NSIS for software used on  a LOT of W98 machines in a LOT of various languages. And by a LOT I really mean a LOT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinoseer</div><div class="date">15th February 2007, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello there again all...<br />
<br />
I am not sure what &quot;trolling&quot; is, but I assure you, I am here to attempt to find a solution...The following has occurred on my PC running Windows 98 (not se)...<br />
<br />
I run MS Office 97, Internet Explorer Version: 6.0.2800.1106IC  Update Versions: SP1; q313829; q832894; q831167; q837009; q833989; q912812; q891781; q918439; q916281<br />
<br />
Also loaded on this system is WSFTP, Outlook Express, and various audio software (Cool Edit Pro, Fruity Loops, Winamp, Flac Frontend, MKW Audio Compression Tool, BitTorrent)<br />
<br />
Verizon DSL is my Internet Provider...my system is on a wireless connection with a 64 bit WEP...<br />
<br />
I don't use Macromedia Shockwave, pop up blockers, add on toolbars, instant messaging, anti-virus, realplayer, musicmatch, yahooplayer...I run a bare bones system that lets me surf Online, update my websites, share Pink Floyd Audio and record/edit music for my band bi-polar neversia...<br />
<br />
I wanted to try a new bit torrent client, so I tried to download azureus from sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=azureus&amp;filename=Azureus_2.4.0.2_Win9x.setup.exe&amp;use_mirror=internap ...<br />
<br />
The following error occurred...<br />
<br />
&quot;NSIS Error<br />
<br />
The installer you are trying to use is corrupted or incomplete.  This could be the result of a damaged disk, a failed download or a virus.<br />
<br />
You may want to contact the author of this installer to obtain a new copy.<br />
<br />
It may be possible to skip this check using the /NCRC command line switch (NOT RECCOMMENDED)&quot;<br />
<br />
Through what research I have completed, I have tried the following solutions...<br />
<br />
deleted win386.swp in DOS, deleted cookies, deleted temp internet files... ran scandisk on all three hard drives on my system &amp; defragmented all three hard drives... updated Windows Installer from Microsoft w/no problems... no virus on system... installed Adaware 6 and scanned for adware, trackers and malware-nothing... downloaded file from computer not on wireless network, burned to CD and tried to execute-same error...tried downloading file from two different mirrors-same error...<br />
<br />
Then I tried to upgrade to a newer version of Adaware, and the same error occurred again...<br />
<br />
Where do I do from here?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time in advance...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backland</div><div class="date">15th February 2007, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets see... how about you delete the installer you downloaded, and download it again?</div></div><hr />

Did you compare the checksum with the file you have on CD and on your computer?

There are several reasons for a downloaded file to get corrupted and NSIS installers have a good sensation on this because of the CRC check.<br />

Did you try to execute the burned on CD file on your friends computers?<br />

Nsis is OK on win98 with or without MS addons (the old windows update) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zootm</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">If you've had this happen with several different files, it could be that your net connection is crapping out on downloading files. All of the other filetypes you list can withstand a certain amount of data damage before serious problems arise; NSIS installers check with a checksum before installing, meaning they'll probably detect any problem, however slight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">My offer to you to get your issue pinpointed:<br />
<br />
I Will download Azureus v3.0.0.6 via a clean *UN-UPDATED* W98_EN OS With IE6 via the link below. I'm downloading from behind a hardware firewall otherwise I would be online for 2 minutes and already be infected by a worm virus...<br />
<br />
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/azureus/Azureus_3.0.0.6_windows.exe?modtime=1171559656&amp;big_mirror=0<br />
<br />
I will post my findings here. But with 137,236,879 downloads via Sourceforge alone already, I seriously think there is something in your specific situation that is not worrking right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I've downloaded Azureus 3.0.0.6 via W98 with IE 5.00.2614.3500 which is the OS and Browser to my availablity with the most know defects and I could download Azureus just fine.<br />
<br />
I do get : <br />
<br />
install4j Wizard could not find a Java(TM) Runtime env... etc.<br />
<br />
Thus Azureus does not use NSIS as an main installer, but install4j, strange indeed... <br />
<br />
See e.g. http://freshmeat.net/projects/install4j/<br />
<br />
BTW after installing Java on the W98 machine I could just install fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Well out of curiosity I've download v2.5.0.4a and this verion is based on NSIS. <br />
<br />
Download goes via SF.net CH, Bern mirror. Download is steady 143 kB/sec.<br />
<br />
Installer uses v2.22 of NSIS and installs just fine!<br />
 Ofcouse giving &quot;No Java JRE could be found on your system&quot; message, but this is normal and has nothing to do with NSIS, it just means you need to install JAVA Virtual Machine Runtime on your machine. (see http://java.com)<br />
<br />
My advise: Clear your IE cache *everything* and try a re-download with your network cable pluged in, not WiFi.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Your machine is quite old. If you haven't done so already, you should check your disk with scandisk. Run the 'Thorough' test with scandisk to check if the disk surface is damaged like it often is with old disks.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh you did do it already :)</div></div><hr />

As someone posted earlier, download some files from Sourceforge and check the checksums that they provide on the site against them; that should help check if your downloads are actually corrupt or if your computer is miscalculating them (it's almost definitely one of these two).</div></div><hr />
