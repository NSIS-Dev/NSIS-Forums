<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YooperNC</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two questions for the forum members:<br />
<br />
1) How can I force a text entry field to allow only Alphabetic characters (no numbers, special characters, etc)?<br />
<br />
2) I have set my text entry fields to be 6 characters in length (max and min both equal 6).  Now, when the user enters six characters, I want the cursor to automatically jump to the next field.  Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YooperNC</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">NOTIFY doesn't seem to do anything until you press a button.  I need to know when the Text Entry field has reached its maximum length of 6 characters, and then I want to set focus to the next text input field.<br />
<br />
Also, still looking for an ALPHA-only setting for the text entry fields as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">NOTIFY indeed doesn't work for that purpose. So without changing the InstallOptions source code, waiting for the feature to be implmented or write a plug-in which will subclass the InstallOptions window; you can't do it.<br />
<br />
As for alpha only, there is no flag for that so you'll have to verify on the leave function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YooperNC</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply. I suppose, then, that I would like these two requests to be considered for future enhancements of the product. In the mean time, I'll go at it from your suggested approaches.<br />
<br />
Have a great weekend!<br />
