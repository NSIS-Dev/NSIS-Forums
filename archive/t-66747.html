<br />
hi,<br />
this may not be a relevant post for this forum. please excuse, but i really couldn't find anywhere else to ask for information.<br />
anyways, the problem that i have is that whenever i try to install any software which has been packaged using NSIS, I get this message box with text &quot;Installer CRC Invalid&quot; and all it presents me with, is an OK button. I know its an NSIS problem because in the title of this message box I have, &quot;Nullsoft Installer v1.44&quot;. Moreover, I tried software from various sites, various vendors, but all software packaged with NSIS give me this error. Even the NSIS installer kit gives me this error when I try to install it. I am really missing out on a lot of good software because of this problem. <br />
Could someone help me out with this, please?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

That would cause the CRC error.  If its just one download causing the problem then it is probaly a bad download, but since you get this a lot, its probaly a problem with your system.<br />

But if you've got a virus, i'll get a good virus-checker.....</div></div><hr />
