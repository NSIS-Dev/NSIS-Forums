<br />
I am using the nsWindows plugin to create a messagebox with a check box. However it is created then the code runs past it and continues  executing the rest of the code. How do I get it to wait until a user has clicked a button?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I am far from being an expert, but I would try the following:<br />
<br />
Put the rest of your function to a new function. Call this function from the button click.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greena23</div><div class="date">30th August 2010, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys for the advice. Really helpful. I have a new problem that I create the window and am using a loop so it does not run on before the user responds. However now the new window becomes unresponsive to the whole installer is stuck.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like the plugin would need a recompile so that it doesn't exit immediately.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the solutions offered here..<br />

..are viable alternatives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">2nd September 2010, 07:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. poked at this some more.. doesn't seem to be behaving itself, so would indeed need a recompile for proper behavior.<br />
<br />
There are at least two other alternatives (next to those in that thread)...<br />
A. create another installer whose only purpose is to display a dialog with the checkbox, with different size/etc., either using nsDialogs or nsWindows, then call that from your original installer using ExecWait.  Passing data back/forth would be the (minor) issue there.<br />
<br />
B. use a MessageBox right after the ${NSW_Show} to halt code execution, hide that messagebox while you need to interact with the nsWindows window (using a timer to find it or something more sane), then close it (SendMessage + WM_CLOSE) once you're done with your nsWindows window so that code execution will then continue.  This most certainly does work, but it's HACKHACKHACK type code.</div></div><hr />
