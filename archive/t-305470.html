<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pidgeot</div><div class="date">18th April 2009, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yes - of course they do. You have surrounded both the executable name and some of the parameters in a single set of double quotes - that will never work, as the quotes tell the shell to treat the contained part as a single element (since it's the first part, it'd be treated as the full executable name). Obviously, you wouldn't expect there to actually be a file with this name (hell, the Win32 subsystem doesn't even ALLOW that name).<br />
<br />
Move the ending &quot; to just after regasm, and it will likely work just fine.<br />
<br />
(I'm assuming you have verified that ${JROOT} and ${DOTNETPATH20} actually contain what they're supposed to, but if they don't, then that's obviously going to be a problem as well.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks, I was doing \&quot; not $\&quot;<br />
<br />
There are spaces in ${JROOT} that is why I needed the second set of quotes.</div></div><hr />
