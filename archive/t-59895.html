This way you could make tweaks to the script over time with out a recompile, and accomidate new versions of your program etc.  I was wondering if this has been proposed.  Is this even possible?  If so would be an effort worth trying? I would be willing to put forth some time trying to make it work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">13th September 2001, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting concept...there is a small app available by one of the regulars here that can do http downloads via the Internet Explorer API, but I don't think that on-the-fly script changes are such a good idea...what if you break something in your users machines?  Downloading the latest version of an application with an installer is a problem, let alone the guts of the installer itself.  What if a user wanted to put a program (maybe not yours) on a machine w/o internet access.  And what if your download site was unavailable for whatever reason?  I'm not saying it doesn't have its merits, I can immediately see them, its just a large number of problems are introduced as well.  If you want to try your hand at it, I'll help with testing, and positive critisism :).<br />
