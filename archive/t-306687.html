<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fishsauce</div><div class="date">24th May 2009, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Much like on Vista, Windows 7 also has a dialog box that pops up asking if an application installed correctly without a manifest.  I was wondering if one is available at this time, or if we can modify things to make it work.<br />
<br />
Also, an exception to the search term length on this forum should probably be made for '7' since I had trouble searching for Windows 7 threads due to that issue.<br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
I tried the modified makensis.exe at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2725883&amp;group_id=22049&amp;atid=373085 but it didn't help.</div></div><hr />

It's by the guy behind PortableApps, but there's no reason it shouldn't work with a standard NSIS installation (since the portable version is just the normal NSIS with a special launcher).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fishsauce</div><div class="date">25th May 2009, 00:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that's what I tried.  Unfortunately it doesn't work (I'm on RC1), and based on the comments from the bug report it seems like it has to be updated for each release since he had to update it for several builds up to 7077.</div></div><hr />
