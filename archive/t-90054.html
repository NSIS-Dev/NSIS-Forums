<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SFP Sonic</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed an irritataing bug when chosing your destination on an NSIS installer.  I explain what I see, to help you understand what is going on.  I'm using an installer to add maps to the game BZ2.  When I start up, it read C:\Program Files\Battlezone II.  I would like to change the directory, so I hit browse.  I browse through the file tree and chose D:\Games\bzii.  When I hit ok, and go back to the Destination screen, my destination now reads: D:\games\bzii\Battlezone II<br />
<br />
My guess is that its attaching the default path onto the user's selection.  Can this be disabled?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but you could try to avoid the dirselection page by reading the proper installdir from registry.<br />
<br />
From the docs:<br />
to disable this, end the directory with a \ (which will require the entire parameter to be enclosed with quotes).<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

To be honest, my first answer was no, since I did not remember this option. To be sure, I looked into the docs again and found the answer. I was just a sec quicker with my edit than Schultz with his reply. Thx Schultz for keeping a close eye to the answers and correcting where necessary!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Schultz</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">This is directly from the NSIS docs<br />
<br />
InstallDir definstdir<br />
<br />
Sets the default installation directory is. See the variables section for variables that can be used to make this string (especially $PROGRAMFILES). Note that the part of this string following the last \ will be used if the user selects 'browse', and may be appended back on to the string at install time (to disable this, end the directory with a \ (which will require the entire parameter to be enclosed with quotes)). If this doesn't make any sense, play around with the browse button a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SFP Sonic</div><div class="date">6th June 2002, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response, problem with the regkey is that many people have multiple installs of bz2, and the regkey on keeps track of one.  Once again, thanks.</div></div><hr />
