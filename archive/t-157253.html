<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sauroneru</div><div class="date">23rd November 2003, 03:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I upgraded from NSIS 2b3 to 2b4.  I understand that the MUI has a new format incompatible with its older versions.  I looked at its documentation, but there is no section for upgrading previous MUI installations - does this exist or does one have to look at the new syntax to try and fix an existing script?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

You will just have to compare syntaxes (and yes this can be tricky with large scripts!)<br />
