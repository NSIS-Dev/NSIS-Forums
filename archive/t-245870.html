<br />
I'm afraid I've hit the wall (I'm not that much of a programmer).<br />
I need to make an API call to LoadUserProfile, (in order to create the profile for a user just created and load its registry hive into HKU). [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/policy/policy/loaduserprofile.asp]<br />
<br />
As I've just created the user (with &quot;net user&quot;), I know its name and the password.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me achieve this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

I am under the impression that you need to:<br />
1) call LogonUserAPI (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/secauthn/security/logonuser.asp) and get a token<br />
2) [maybe you don't need this step] call DuplicateTokenExAPI (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/secauthz/security/duplicatetoken.asp) in order to duplicate the token to a new one with the required  access rights<br />
3) call LoadUserProfile (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/policy/policy/loaduserprofile.asp) using the token from step 2<br />
4) call UnloadUserProfile (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/policy/policy/unloaduserprofile.asp)   after you're done.<br />
<br />
There is a microsoft article (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;196070)  that discusses something similar to the above<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

Unfortunately, I'm not much of a programmer. Don't get me wrong, I've gone a long way in the scripting world, and have several thousands of line of experience with NSIS.<br />
However, talk to me about APIs, pointers, structures and that sort of thing, and I start crying...<br />
So, I was kind of hoping someone with a lot of experience in that sort of things would have tried that before and could therefore give me a hand...<br />
<br />
Short of that, I guess I'll have to dig into my C books again (I avoided for years!)</div></div><hr />
