<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reven</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been fiddling with the code and I can't quite get this to work. Basically, during the &quot;Function .oninit&quot; part I am displaying a few images one after the other, but I want to have one .wav file play continuous throughout these pictures showing.<br />
<br />
I can get it so that the sound plays in over the first bitmap but when the bitmap closes to make way for a new bitmap the sound stops too, mid-play.<br />
<br />
The other parts of the &quot;.oninit&quot; are to do with confirming whether the user definately wants to install and making sure two installations don't open at once. They're not important.<br />
<br />
So put simply, I need a &quot;slideshow&quot; of images to display with one sound track playing throughout just after the install executable is started. Please can someone show me what I am doing wrong.<br />
<br />
I have attached my entire .onInit code which should hopefully appear below. Thanks in advance, and help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reven</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks alot for that, but just one thing:<br />
<br />
  !define APP_NAME &quot;mci.sound&quot;<br />
  !define SND_NAME &quot;tango.mp3&quot;<br />
<br />
Why do I need two sound files, and how do I make a '.sound' file? Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">APP_NAME defines name of exe file, mci.sound.exe<br />
The only sound file in this example is tango.mp3<br />
To test this change tango.mp3 to sound.wav<br />
<br />
  File &quot;${SND_NAME}&quot;<br />
  System::Call 'msvfw32.dll::MCIWndCreate(i 0, i 0,i 0x0070, t &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\${SND_NAME}&quot;) i .r0'<br />
  SendMessage $0 0x0465 0 &quot;STR:play repeat&quot;<br />
  System::Call 'user32.dll::ShowWindow(i r0, i 0)'</div></div><hr />
