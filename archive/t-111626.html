Not sure if this question was already posted here...<br />
<br />
Is there a way to prevent the user from not installing the product,<br />
if they have already installed the product on one machine?<br />
What I mean is, say if a user installed the product on machine &quot;ABC&quot;,<br />
then copy the setup.exe to an other machine &quot;DEF&quot; and start<br />
installing the same product on that other machine.<br />
How do I prevent the user to not install the product on &quot;DEF&quot;?<br />
<br />
One of the ways I thought of resolving the problem is by appending<br />
the SYSTEM_INFO at the end of setup.exe file during the first<br />
install. For subsequent installs, verify the SYSTEM_INFO to see<br />
if the user has moved/copied the binary to other machines, if so<br />
STOP the installation.<br />
But don't know how to implement the above scenerio using NSIS?<br />
Does anyone have a better solution, or can anyone help me with<br />
the NSIS script for implementing the above solutions.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you want to restrict the number of installations? I think that it is a bad idea, the user should be able to reinstall the software.<br />
<br />
Just make a good license, protections never really work anyway.</div></div><hr />

The best solution you can have is write something on the server side. A user called snowchyld has done something similar, he might help you better.</div></div><hr />
