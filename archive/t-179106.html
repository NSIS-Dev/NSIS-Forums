It would be useful, cause the user hasn't to click throught 20 Dialogs when he can make 3 or 4 inputs in only one dynamic Dialog<br />
<br />
is there anyway to do this?</div></div><hr />

nevertheless thanks Vytautas<br />

Well, I hope you didn't start yet to write those 20 dialogs, as there IS a solution to your problem: dselkirk wrote a plugin that can show/hide controls:<br />

<br />
unfortunatly if I click on Oracle or SQL it jumps to the Next page like I've clicked on Next and the I cant make any input into the textbox I defined I'll attach the the Script and the ini, maybe someone has an idea<br />
<br />
 I know that some parts are not complete yet, but they don't use the script evilO gave me... so they shouldnt be responsible for the error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilO</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi :)<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay I had some work to get done.. <br />
<br />
<br />
1) In the function &quot;cp_leave&quot;, just replace<br />
<br />
ReadIniStr $R0 &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\dynamic.ini&quot; &quot;Settings&quot; &quot;State&quot;<br />
<br />
by<br />
<br />
ReadIniStr $R0 &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\ioSDBType.ini&quot; &quot;Settings&quot; &quot;State&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;dynamic.ini&quot; was the name of the ini file I used to test the script. So the installer tries to read the user input in a file that does not exist, therefore causing the error.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Another point: I've just spotted that in the script I forgot to &quot;Pop $R0&quot; before the two instructions &quot;Abort&quot; , causing values to pile up... fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Another issue, about the &quot;NOTIFY&quot; flag : there is a bug if the user changes the selection using the keyboard, the 'leave' function is called around 18 times (put a MessageBox and you'll see that..). <br />

I think that's all.. Let me know if there are still problems.. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your fixes evilO, but it still doesn't work<br />
<br />
if I click on one of the two options, the next dialog is shown - If I use this script only(without my extensions) it works, but as soon as I complete the script it doesn't work anymore<br />
<br />
similar thing with the LangString error - I've another Setup which works, but in this script there's an error...<br />
<br />
its confusing<br />
<br />
some scripts work with parts of code, but other scripts don't even if I adapt the paths and so on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilO</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Err, really strange, it's working fine on my computer.. :eek:<br />
Same remark for the LangString problem, it's working just fine.. <br />
<br />
Which version of NSIS do you use?<br />
<br />
could you attach the whole script with your last modifications?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Now it quite works<br />
<br />
I defined an own langFile, included it - got an error - included german - and it worked<br />
<br />
and the dynamicPage...well it works...but...<br />
<br />
there are two inputboxes<br />
i entered some text and clicked next<br />
<br />
it copied the files and showed the finishscreen - after pressing finish<br />
it started again o_O<br />
<br />
is this what you meant above?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilO</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I defined an own langFile, included it - got an error - included german - and it worked<br />
Well, you shouldn't have to define you own LangFile to get this working...<br />
it copied the files and showed the finishscreen - after pressing finish it started again<br />
What to you mean by &quot;it started again&quot; ?<br />
is this what you meant above?<br />
<br />
Err, which sentence in which post? :confused:<br />
If you still have problems, could you please attach your script?<br />

<br />
<br />
hmm here is the Script<br />
<br />
If I click on FINISH it returns to the welcomepage and I have to click all dialogs a second time, but it works as I want it to... but its nevertheless confusing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilO</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, no it's not related to the bug about the &quot;NOTIFY&quot; flag I told you about. <br />
<br />
If you have to go through all the dialogs a 2nd time, it's because you defined all the pages twice in your script, to get rid of the &quot;LangString problem&quot; I guess. <br />
<br />
I have just removed the MUI macros between the functions &quot;.onInit&quot; and &quot;cp_show&quot;:<br />
- No LangString warning<br />
- No &quot;Double execution&quot;<br />
- The radiobuttons with the &quot;NOTIFY&quot; flags are working<br />
<br />
You can check the examples in &quot;NSIS\Examples\Modern UI&quot; if you are still confused..<br />
