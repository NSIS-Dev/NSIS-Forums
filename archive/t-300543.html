<br />
I am definitely new to NSIS and SkinBuilder. I am trying to make a skin that has a person sticking out of the side, which I have gotten pretty far with.<br />
<br />
My problem is when someone wants to cancel the pop up that comes up looks horrible due to scaling. I am trying to figure out how I can modify the cancel screen. Can I use a different skin for that pop up? If not, where would I modify the size settings for the pop up window?<br />
<br />
I have looked all over for an answer and havent found anything yet. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
if this helps, I am using MUI. <br />
<br />
I really thought this problem would be a lot easier to figure out.<br />
<br />
<br />
--NOTE to ADMIN very sorry I didnt mean to start a new thread. I was tryting to reply to my original post and started a new thread. Can you move this message to the &quot;Abort / Cancel pop up modification&quot; thread?</div></div><hr />
