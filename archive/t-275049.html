But on the start menu it doesn't show, but the icon for the uninstaller does.  And if I open the program group from the start menu into an explorer window the icon shows fine there.  This oddity under Vista, haven't tried it on XP.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?:confused:</div></div><hr />

i've also win vista and my experience with vista are very very bad. the last time i found that huge amount of bugs was on win me.<br />
<br />
ok, back to your problem.<br />
<br />
the magic word could be &quot;Max cached Icons&quot; if my previous speaker has right with his assertion. search for &quot;IconCache.db&quot; make a backup, delete it and restart win vista.<br />
you can do also modify your registry. go on start-button - run and type in regedit. now go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer and add a new string named &quot;Max Cached Icons&quot; then doubleclick on &quot;Max Cached Icons&quot; and set the value e.g. 512, 1024, 4096 or 8192. i think this should be megabytes cache but i'm not sure with that. after that jsut reboot your machine and now it could work as you wanted it.<br />
<br />
the other possibility could be the icons you use for your progam. Notice that vista uses icons in another way as win xp do it. you find in your *.ico pictures as follows:<br />
256x256 - 32 (compressed only on vista)<br />
48x48   - 32<br />
32x32   - 32<br />
16x16   - 32<br />
256x256 - 256 (compressed only on vista)<br />
48x48   - 256<br />
32x32   - 256<br />
16x16   - 256<br />
256x256 - 16 (compressed only on vista)<br />
48x48   - 16<br />
32x32   - 16<br />
16x16   - 16<br />
<br />
a shareware program and tutorial can be found here: http://www.axialis.com/tutorials/tutorial-iw023.html. my thought was that for e.g. one of four pictures is missing, but to be honest i think my first advise was the one your are looking for.<br />
<br />
on my vista this was all i need to get my icons (selfmade):<br />
<br />
!define MUI_ICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\MUI Orange Vista Theme\${OMUI_THEME}\install.ico&quot;<br />
!define MUI_UNICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\MUI Orange Vista Theme\${OMUI_THEME}\uninstall.ico&quot;<br />
<br />
you see its not impossible. i think its just a bug in your vista if its isn't a feature from ms!</div></div><hr />
