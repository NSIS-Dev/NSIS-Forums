<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durando</div><div class="date">6th July 2007, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">This script is doing two things first of all it is searching for a specific registry key to get the install path and also making sure that the program this addon is inteded for is installed, this part of the script works without problems.<br />
<br />
The Second part is using the Processes plugin to see if this program is running, if the program is found to be running $R0 should return 1 and halt on the message i have created for some reason it does not and I cant figure out why.  I'm hoping its a simple error on my part that one of you will beable to find and help me correct.<br />

Function .onInit<br />
ReadRegStr $R1 HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Program Manufacturer\Program To Search For\&quot; &quot;InstallPath&quot;<br />

What is the loop label about?<br />
<br />
You may want to give a try to FCT plugin as well,<br />
