is there any possibility to replace a file within a installer exe?<br />
<br />
The installer was packed with the default zlib algorithm and the file i want to be replaced has the same size as the one included in the installer.<br />
<br />
I recognized, that 7zip is able to read and extract the exe and i am able to locate the file within the installer, opend in 7zip but it seems they haven't implemented functionalities for replacing or adding files in this mode yet.<br />
<br />
thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BFuture_BM</div><div class="date">27th February 2007, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, legitimate question ;)<br />
the installer generation is embedded as one task in our build pipeline. the builds are under a cms and the installer, that needed one file fixed is the product of an older build process. Therefore it would be timeconsuming and error-proned to do a rebuild of this state or trying to reconstruct the build out of existing files for recompiling the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">27th February 2007, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I see, however developers who want to distribute software safely, should never disable the CRCCheck (which is enabled by default) so even if 7zip or another tool would offer abilities to add/replace files within the package, would be useless as they would alter the CRC causing the installer to pop up a warning about potential danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BFuture_BM</div><div class="date">27th February 2007, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed, i have crccheck disabled, because the installer can only be transfered within a client-server-application, which is caring about the issue of devective transmissions.<br />
additionally, the file i want to be replaced has the same size as the original one (to the last bit), because i only changed a string-content.<br />
so, do you think there is any possibility to replace this file?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">27th February 2007, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know the only tool that is able to open a NSIS package is 7zip but you already know that they haven't implement yet the add/replace feature.<br />
I'm afraid you're going to recompile the whole script or create a patch which updates the current installation with the new file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BFuture_BM</div><div class="date">27th February 2007, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">that was the answer i was afraid of, but thank you very much for your aid!</div></div><hr />
