<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mlrye</div><div class="date">2nd November 2007, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Providing an absolute path as the value for the PATCH_FILES_ROOT in the patch script results in a successful build but failed patcher.<br />
<br />
Using the default example if I were to add paths as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
!define PATCH_SOURCE_ROOT &quot;C:\versions\version2&quot;<br />
!define PATCH_FILES_ROOT &quot;C:\patches\patch2&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
when the patch runs, during the file modification step where it creates a directory and extracts the patch file, the path to extract becomes mangled <br />
<br />
<br />
Extract: C:\DOCUME~1\User\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsy74.tmp\C:\patches\patch2\test.txt.pat<br />
Unable to open patch file<br />
<br />
<br />
including the &quot;C:\&quot; in the middle causing this step to fail.<br />
<br />
In addition, if I were to change the PATCH_FILES_ROOT to include &quot;../../../&quot; in it, I run the risk of extracting patch files outside of the temp folder.<br />
<br />
Otherwise very nice utility.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mlrye</div><div class="date">2nd November 2007, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed.  Just thought I would warn the NSIS community in general who might use it because it is a helpful utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just pop in now and again ;-)<br />
<br />
Had a quick look at the problem. It seems the VPatchFile macro  does not like absoulte paths. I think the best way to deal with this would be to improve the VPatchFile macro rather than implement our own. I could apply fixes to the VPatchFile macro regarding handling of spaces in the name suggested in the wiki page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/VPatch_plug-in)at the same time. <br />
I'll see what I can do....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">viperpiper</div><div class="date">10th November 2007, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Updated nsisPatchGen to v1.0.2 which fixes the problems with absolute paths and paths with spaces in them.<br />
<br />
We no longer use the VPatchFile macro, instead we use our own modified version of it.</div></div><hr />
