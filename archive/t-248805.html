<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Potz</div><div class="date">15th June 2006, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if I would be able to run other installs with NSIS.  I have looked into it a little but so far I haven’t seen anything regarding it.  What I would like to do is make a multiple install installer… I guess that’s what you would call it.  For example picking from a list to install certain programs such as Microsoft office, WinZip, Oracle, and some others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CancerFace</div><div class="date">15th June 2006, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">You can easily do that. In general you can start another executable using ExecWait in your NSIS script in order to wait for the new thread to finish. If you do not want to interact with the invoked executable then it would be a good idea to figure out if it has any automatic deployment options. For example, MS Office is an MSI based installation so it is easy to control it. There are several sites which are dedicated to the silent deployment of packages, such as AppDeploy (http://appdeploy.com/) or MSFN (http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showforum=80).<br />
