<br />
I wrote a custom MUI2 page using nsDialogs for some specific settings. On the bottom of the page, there are the three &quot;standard&quot; buttons (Back, Next, Cancel). Now I'd like to enable or disable some of these bottoms depending on the user's selections (e. g. from within the update function of a certain component).<br />
<br />
Which command can I use to enable/disable the Back, Next and Cancel buttons?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">28th May 2010, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">just get a handle to the appropriate button...<br />
<br />
Next Button: GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 1<br />
Cancel Button: GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 2<br />
Back Button: GetDlgItem $0 $HWNDPARENT 3<br />
<br />
...then use EnableWindow...<br />
<br />
disable: EnableWindow $0 0 <br />
enable: EnableWindow $0 1</div></div><hr />

Please search before you post.I did, obviously using improper search terms, or being somewhat blind. ;) However, if this is a FAQ, I'd expect to find the issue either in the nsDialogs manual or the corresponding FAQ. But (unless I am too blind again) it does not seems to appear anywhere on http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html.</div></div><hr />

You can use google and the forum search, and then there's of course the command reference: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.9.14.6</div></div><hr />

Truth be told, I never really got around to understanding how the outer window DOES work, but the inside's what does it for me, I guess. ;)</div></div><hr />
