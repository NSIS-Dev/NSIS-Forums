<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Master</div><div class="date">23rd May 2001, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd do this myself but (1) I'm not a very good C programmer, and (2) I don't have 3 billion dollars for M$es damn C compiler :)<br />
<br />
1) When doing an install in NT/2K, it would be nice to be able to say &quot;install to ALL users&quot; - by default the installer only does the logged in user. Not real sure how to implement this one tho. I'd assume a new $variable, but you'd also need to be able to differentiate the install in the script.<br />
<br />
2) I need to install some font files. I think I can just drop them to the fonts directory, but that isn't necessarily easy, since a user can remap the fonts folder using the shell namespace. I wanted to add a $FONTDIR variable, but here I get stopped by my lack of a compiler. The BETTER solution here was be a pseudo-variable that can reference the shell folders. There's already a helper function in util.c to do the lookup, but you'd need a variable like this to do the callout:<br />
<br />
$SHELLFOLDER(Fonts)<br />
<br />
It would just pass &quot;Fonts&quot; to the queryShellFolders helper function and return that as the result. Naturally, this would suck if it blew up, but that could maybe just dump the value of $TEMP into a failed request.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I think they're both excellent ideas!</div></div><hr />
