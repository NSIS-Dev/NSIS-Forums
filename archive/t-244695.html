<br />
I have a custom page that uses the Modern UI, which has validations at the end of the function.  Right now if I press Cancel, the usual dialog pops up confirming if I want to abort the install, if I say Yes then the validations are performed and possibly popup another message, something I'd obviously like to avoid.<br />
<br />
I want to bypass the validations if the user cancels or presses the back button.  How can I detect those two states?  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

You are meant to validate it in the Leave function. Firstly, the Leave function is only called when the user clicks the Next button, and secondly the Leave function is actually called before the plugin exits.<br />

<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
