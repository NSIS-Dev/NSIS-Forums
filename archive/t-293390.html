<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">20th June 2008, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am curious, do all files that get installed to PLUGINSDIR get automagically set at the top block of the Installer?<br />
<br />
Ie, does doing the &quot;File&quot; command with the output location set to PLUGINSDIR automatically get set as a ReserveFile?<br />
<br />
Looking at MUI2 source code, I see no particular attempt at Reserving the things that go into the Plugindir, which is why I ask...<br />
<br />
Like in Contrib\Modern UI 2\Interface.nsh, we can see:<br />
<br />
        File &quot;/oname=$PLUGINSDIR\modern-header.bmp&quot; &quot;${MUI_HEADERIMAGE_${UNINSTALLER}BITMAP_RTL}&quot;<br />
<br />
I also have some bitmaps in my own code that I copy to PLUGINSDIR, and I want to make sure that indeed, they are at the top of the Installer data code...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">20th June 2008, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, yeah, for the MUI2 files, I can see you don't need to do the Reserve, as its always included first.<br />
<br />
But what our scripts, say we have a &quot;File&quot; command buried down in one of our functions towards the end of our script, perhaps 1+ Gigs deep into the Installer.<br />
<br />
I guess I better just play it safe, and do the ReserveFile, just in case.<br />
<br />
One more question about ReserveFile...<br />
Does NSIS parse the full script first to find all ReserveFile commands, before it parses the script to actually built the Installer?<br />
<br />
If it doesn't, does this mean I need to put the ReserveFile command as close to the top of the &quot;main&quot; script as possible?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">21st June 2008, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I think MakeNSIS will run through the script and it will add a file to the data block as soon as that file appears in a &quot;File&quot; or &quot;ReserveFile&quot; instruction. So yes, if I'm not mistaken you should put the &quot;ReserveFile&quot; instructions at the top of your script. But there is no need to reserve any files, unless they are extracted out of order. For example files extracted in your &quot;.onInit&quot; function should be reserved. Files extracted only in normal &quot;Section&quot; blocks shouldn't be reserved...</div></div><hr />
