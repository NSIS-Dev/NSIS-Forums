<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fabiochelly</div><div class="date">22nd November 2006, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry if this post does not belong here but I don't know if my problem is related or not to NSIS.<br />
<br />
I use NSIS to install my application. The installation works fine but my program refuses to start.<br />
<br />
The problem comes from the COM Interface integrated to my application. the com server tries to register itself at the initialization of my exe.<br />
<br />
When I execute the exe in Vista, I get an exception: EOleSysError, Erreur d'accÃ¨s du Registre OLE.<br />
<br />
Does anyone knows if I have to change something in the setup to change the rights of my exe and authorize the registration of my COM interface?<br />
<br />
Or do I have to change something in the application itself?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Fabio Chelly</div></div><hr />

It doesn't seem like you're the only having this problem. Maybe one of these results will be helpful.</div></div><hr />

As in right click and select &quot;run as administrator&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Do not use Local Machine registry keys - unless they can be set at install time and are applicable to all users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">24th November 2006, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">And make sure you test on Windows Vista RTM version NOT Beta1/2 or RC1/2. MS changed a lot just before the RTM release. <br />
<br />
Things that did not work as expected even adhering fully to an API suddenly started working in the RTM version.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista RTM is available via MSDN.</div></div><hr />
