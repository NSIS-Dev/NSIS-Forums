<br />
Ive seen a few people asking about building NSIS installers with Visual Studio (MSBuild), so i whipped up a custom MSBuild task that should let you accomplish this.<br />
<br />
Full source and an example is included in the attachment below, as well as a template for adding this to your own solution. just open template.vbproj, and edit as needed<br />
<br />
NOTE: This took me about an hour to do. It hasnt been tested very thoroughly. It probably meets most definitions of the term &quot;Dirty Hack&quot;. YMMV.<br />
<br />
i will be happy to answer any questions/problems/feature requests/feedback etc<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Your idea looks great but I got a lot of errors when I tried to compile your project.<br />
<br />
I am using Visual Studio 2008 and your project is for VS 2010, so I downgraded .sln and related stuff.<br />
Then I got lot of error for Microsoft.Build.Utilities.v4.0 which you are using, because I use Microsoft.Build.Utilities.v3.5.<br />
Error	1	'GeneratedCodeAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.CodeDom.Compiler'.	<br />
Error	2	'EditorBrowsableAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.ComponentModel'.	<br />
Error	3	'EditorBrowsableAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.ComponentModel'.	<br />
Error	4	'GeneratedCodeAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.CodeDom.Compiler'.	<br />
Error	5	'EditorBrowsableAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.ComponentModel'.	<br />
Error	6	'ApplicationSettingsBase' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Configuration'.	<br />
Error	7	'ApplicationSettingsBase' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Configuration'.	<br />
Error	8	'HelpKeywordAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.ComponentModel.Design'.<br />
Error	9	Name 'NSISEngine' is not declared.<br />
Error	10	Name 'NSISEngine' is not declared.	<br />
Error	11	'Process' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Diagnostics'.	<br />
Error	12	Property without a 'ReadOnly' or 'WriteOnly' specifier must provide both a 'Get' and a 'Set'.	<br />
Error	13	Statement cannot appear within a property body. End of property assumed.<br />
Error	14	Property missing 'End Property'.	<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All this errors are related to .net Framewrok - in your version [4.0] everything is present, but not in 3.5 which I use.<br />
So is there possibility for you to create a lower version? I mean target framework should be 3.5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attached is a zip containing both visual studio 2010 and visual studio 2008 version (.net 4 and .net 3.5 respectively). they should behave exactly the same. The visual studio 2008 version may give you a security warning about custom tasks (because it contains custom tasks), but this can be safely ignored</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AC_Sherway</div><div class="date">18th September 2012, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">hey, i don't know if you still follow this, but i am interested in making this work, but i am kind of noob when it comes to these extra features of visual studio.<br />
<br />
how do i make my existing project into an NSIS installer package using this?<br />
<br />
i have NSIS installed and i downloaded the VS2010 zip file you attached, but i don't know where to fit the pieces :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">insertjokehere</div><div class="date">18th September 2012, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Grab the zip in my second post, and extract it somewhere<br />
2. Pick the appropriate folder for the visual studio version you are using<br />
3. move the NSISCTask folder into the folder for your visual studio solution<br />
4. add the project for that folder as a project in your solution inside visual studio<br />
5. edit template/template.vbproj with a text editor<br />
6. set the &lt;Compile Include=&quot;...&quot; /&gt; line to have the name of your .nsi file<br />
7. if you have any .nsh files, add them as &lt;Header&gt; entries, otherwiser remove that whole ItemGroup<br />
8. set NSISEngine to point to your makensis.exe (either in C:\Program Files\.... or C:\Program Files (x86)\...)<br />
9. add template.vbproj as a project in your solution<br />
<br />
you should now be able to build a .nsi from within visual studio by right clicking on this project and selecting build, or if you use some kind of continuous integration by invoking msbuild</div></div><hr />

<br />
I appreciate insertjokehere's tool but it is a really &quot;hardcore solution&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is a long time since this tool was published: it was great in those times but there were some problems and lack of functionality so I decided to develop my own solution called &quot;Visual &amp; Installer&quot;.<br />
It is an extension for developing NSIS project directly in Visual Studio and it is really easy to use it. <br />
Check my signature if you are interested in it, you can download it for free (Trial).<br />
<br />
Sorry for self promotion :cool:</div></div><hr />
