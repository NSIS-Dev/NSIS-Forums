<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">intelworker</div><div class="date">2nd July 2006, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it seems symantec updated it's virus definitions again and all uninstallation files recognize like Trojan.Zlob. And now i even can't download and run nsis installation package.<br />
Checked using:<br />
Norton Antivirus 2006.<br />
Symantec Antivirus 10.0 Corporate Edition.<br />
Developers, please do something with that idiots in symantec ;)<br />
Nsis is a Great job, btw :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
rough words - forum, ban these (...) Symantec consumers.<br />
<br />
Symatec products always suck - and they suck ev'time a bit more.<br />
<br />
I never had a postive false with NOD, but i see lots with Symantec, McAfee, KAV, and some more.<br />
<br />
and one more - symantec has a deal with microsoft that some nice tweaking and modifier tools where treaten as virus/trojans/aso.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kookh</div><div class="date">2nd July 2006, 04:10</div></div><div class="posttext">well I am sure it is a false positive... but people using my installer are reporting Trojan.Zlob found with Norton Antivirus. I can't have that, can anyone do anything about this? or tell me what needs to be done to avoid it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd July 2006, 05:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure they're using the latest definitions, because this has, as far as I know, already been fixed. If it hasn't been fixed, report this to Symantec and give them my e-mail for more details (kichik@users.sf.net). Rebuild your installer with another version, such as the newly released 2.18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kookh</div><div class="date">2nd July 2006, 05:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, I'll follow steps 1 and 3 for now.</div></div><hr />

And again i miss the News for that...</div></div><hr />

I can second intelworker's issue.  SAV 10 corporate with 7/1/06 v8 defs, which are latest as of right now (10:00 AM EST). I'll email Symantec, and give them your info, as I've got over multiple packages deployed to 70,000 users that can't be updated on the fly. ;-)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kookh</div><div class="date">3rd July 2006, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Does 2.18 cause the same problem ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">4th July 2006, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I had quite a few of my installs wiped out by this latest problem with Symantec.  <br />
<br />
So far, however, rebuilding them in NSIS version 2.18 seems to have worked.  (Using a different compression algorithm may also work, although I've found nothing concrete to support this claim.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just installed 2.18 to get around this problem.  Didn't work.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeh3</div><div class="date">4th July 2006, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I have installed 2.18 and no problems at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhalsim2</div><div class="date">4th July 2006, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I had 2.17 installed.  Got the error.  Found this message thread.  Read that 2.18 doesn't have the problem, then downloaded and installed 2.18 (and selected the option to remove the old version).  Right after installation, my Symantec deleted lmza_solid as shown in my attached screen shot.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled 2.18 and reinstalled it.  It didn't happen the second time.  Weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">4th July 2006, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...instead unistalling NSIS, you can uninstall symantec and try another AV product? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">4th July 2006, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I would suggest as well :p</div></div><hr />

And what about people using my installer? What kind of trust would I be showing if I tell them to uninstall Norton/Symantec?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">4th July 2006, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI:<br />
After installing updates to Symantec (Corporate edition), the problems went away not only in my installations, but also 3rd party installations (such as the one for FileZilla and InkScape).<br />
<br />
Just in case it's useful for anyone, here are the details on the version I was using:<br />
Program version: 10.0.2.2000<br />
Scan Engine:  61.1.0.11<br />
Virus Definition File:  7/3/2006 rev.22</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't use Symantec at home, but it's the standard at my company.  But even if it were up to me, I can't make my ~1,000,000 users switch and wouldn't want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they seem to use NSIS! :)<br />
<br />
False Positive was corrected in recent definition updates, but i added it to the Wiki :)</div></div><hr />
