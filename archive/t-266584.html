<br />
just starting with NSIS and it looks really cool! :)<br />
<br />
I *have* searched the forum for my questions but couldn't find a reference to them. If there are posts for them please just point me to the given thread.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to create an installer for a pure web-application (which is written in php) and the installer should allow to <br />
a) install locally in case a webserver is installed already<br />
b) install remote through ftp / sftp and not leaving any trace locally.<br />
<br />
I think I can manage to create these two install options but I couldn't find a setting to avoid installing the files locally.<br />
Is there a way to? <br />
<br />
The remote-upload is shown in <br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Recursive_Upload<br />
and should work fine so far but does it support sftp / scp too? Or is there a plugin with support for sftp / scp?<br />
<br />
Again, if any of these were discussed already please point me to the appropriate threads :).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Thomas<br />
Or is there any</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ts77</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm as far as doing the remote install by ftp without problems and simply deleting the local installation after the upload.<br />
unfortunately some directories (from the last section before the upload) can't be deleted here. dunno yet why.<br />
I even managed to collect the db-settings and write the config file ;). <br />
I have to admit, its a great install system :).<br />
<br />
Some uploader with sftp/scp support would still be highly interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
