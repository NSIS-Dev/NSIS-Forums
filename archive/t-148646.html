<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SprinklerHead</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having some problems running my application on some NT based machines. I think it has something to do with file permissions, but I am honestly not sure. I was going to use the AccessControl plugin to see if that helped, but I am not an NT guru, so hopefully someone here can help.<br />
<br />
My application must be installed on the root of a drive, lets say c:\doodat. The application reads and writes to many files within c:\doodat. What would the syntax be for the AccessControl plugin in this case? I think what I want to do is allow &quot;Users&quot; full access, but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
I also install bpl files (Delphi dlls) into the \winnt\system32 folder. Do special permissions have to be set there as well?<br />
<br />
In one case, a user could not see any of the text in my application. I tracked it down to him not having access permission for a font I install in the \winnt\fonts folder. What permission must be set there?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
