<br />
  I need to let the user choose a font out of a list of fonts that come with the installer and then have the installer install that font on the user machine. To make his choice the user should be able to view each font (i.e. view some text written in each font like &quot;Hello World&quot; or whatever) and then check the font they want to use.<br />
<br />
  I looked for a plugin that can process fonts (display, install) and that supports Windows XP/Vista/7 but I can not find any. <br />
<br />
  Anyone knows if there is any such plugin? If not, any change that you know of any open source utility that can do that and I can embed into the installer?<br />
<br />
  Hopefully this was done before :-)<br />
<br />
  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zivha</div><div class="date">19th February 2011, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">you mean prepare images in advance for each font? I guess that can work if there is no other way around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zivha</div><div class="date">19th February 2011, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah - AddFontResource, just read on MSDN seems like what I needed thanks!<br />
<br />
I also found this utility fontreg.exe small silent command line utility to install fonts might just use it.</div></div><hr />
