<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LMC</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there<br />
<br />
I am creating an installer for a project with _many_ files marked with the system attribute (1421 files to be exact). The installer just ignores the system attributes when I include files with  File /r &quot;C:\project\*.*&quot;.<br />
<br />
Since I have this many files I really like to have some way to make makensis preserve file attributes instead of using SetFileAttribute 1421 times. What is the best way to accomplish this? Does any one have a patch to do this or have I missed an option?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LMC</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately this is no good enough to solve my problem easely. My files with the system attribute set are located in a lot of different directories and not all files in these directories should have the system attribute set.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thx for the tip.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LMC</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I allready have a script that adds a lot of SetFileAttribute to the .nsi file. IMHO this is a hacky way of solving the problem.<br />
<br />
Is there any reason why attributes are not preserved? To me it seems like a bug. For example, consider the command 'tar'. If this did not preserve file attributes you would be lost.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 01:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps another parameter like /a could be used with the File command to preserve the file attributes.  This would be a pretty convenient feature.  All it would really do is to a SetFileAttributes with the actual attributes after the file command.  Perhaps I will try to add this fix and post my results later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LMC</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding a /a to File would be a very nice way of introducing this feature. I am looking forward to see a patch.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
