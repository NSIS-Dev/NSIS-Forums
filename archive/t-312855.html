<br />
Before my software gets installed, I like a messagebox to be displayed, with a warning.  I want the end user to select a checkmark that says [ ] Yes, I agree to the terms.<br />
<br />
The [ ok ] button should not be enabled until the yes is checked.  Other wise the user chooses cancel to quit.<br />
<br />
How can this be accomplished?  EULA field is not appropriate here, I think.  Because it is not a licence, its a warning.<br />
<br />
Though if EULA has to be used, I want it so that the entire message is scrolled to the bottom before yes/no is enabled.<br />
<br />
The message box text is not that long, however, i just need the enduser to read and accept this message.  a warning box in the oninit field would be where I want this to occur.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!</div></div><hr />

But I don't think you can (temporarily) disable a button.<br />
<br />
I think you better go with a license page.<br />
To force scroll down:<br />

Forcing a scrolldown will NOT force anyone to actually read it. You'll probably only end up annoying your users.<br />
<br />
If you want people to read your license, it's a much much better idea to make the license EXTREMELY short. Say, ten lines tops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i really hope that nsDialogs will one day allow the customization of all parts of a standard nsis installer: including messageboxes, components and instfiles page.<br />

<br />
i agree with your opinion about license scrolldown, but don't forget there are legal reasons for the length of some licenses</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our licence is very long due to the legal departments requirements.  In fact we have two EULAs for hardware and software needs.<br />
<br />
I thought a third EULA would be out of the question.<br />
<br />
This is a warning message, more a legal disclaimer that pretty much doesnt hold us responsible if an enduser uses a new feature irresponsibly and it causes harm to humans and/or property kind of thing.<br />
<br />
The department wanted a warning message that the user had to read, but the check mark he wanted that stated, &quot;I have read the above and agree to its terms...&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there a way to say build this kind of dialogue in C++, compile it as a dll?<br />
<br />
The warning note is fairly wordy (163 words total) but I am thinking of genericising it so i can pass the text as a string and have the rest of hte behaviour.<br />
<br />
Something like this:<br />
