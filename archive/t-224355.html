There've been a lot of false positives...<br />
no doubt this can be another one.</div></div><hr />

i for one know nsis isnt malware or a virus, but the people im providing an installer to are all too cautious about things like this, the smallest little thing will set them into a flame war on the forums we post on<br />
im wondering if there is an alternative to do the same thing without being detected by the scanners</div></div><hr />

So the only really working thing you can do is report these false positives to those AV companies.<br />

Hopefully AV companies can learn to detect the difference, since the worm is mainly detected via registry key presence. AV companies don't detect NSIS installers as virus just because of some malware/trojan is using NSIS in it's name. That would be stupid. They detect NSIS, because some malware/trojans are made with NSIS.</div></div><hr />
