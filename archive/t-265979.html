<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">17th February 2007, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to code some logic in NSIS that is currently being done with vbscript. (I think the NSIS interface is much more professional looking than popup message boxes from vbscript.) <br />
<br />
The vbs uses a lot of WMI calls to query WIN32_SerialPort, (I think there are some other classes, but I left the code at the office). Can I do it with the SYSTEM:: plugin? Or do I just have to find the registry locations for each piece of data I'm interested in?<br />
<br />
I also thought about calling the vbscript from NSIS, but I need to figure out how to handle the WMI responses (collections, etc) and get that back into the NSIS to be processed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th February 2007, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">WMI has a COM API (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa389276.aspx) which you can use with the System plug-in. However, using COM with System isn't that comfortable and best suited for small-sized scripts. You have to look for the ordinal of every method in the header files before you can call it.</div></div><hr />
