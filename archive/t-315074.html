<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madsvlad</div><div class="date">3rd December 2009, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to determine a set of components when the uninstaller is run based on information stored in the registry (by the installer). Sections are compile time, is there a way to accomplish this at runtime?<br />
<br />
I was thinking about was creating a custom dialog that looks like a components page, but would be filled in using callbacks. I don't see a tree control available in nsDialogs, though?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
