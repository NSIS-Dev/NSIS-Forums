<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I was scanning my computer recently with Kaspersky using the extended databases : Pronware, spyware, and malware.<br />
<br />
It scanned thru NSIS20.exe and came up with Not-A-Virus:Totalvelocity.o.  I was puzzled until it then scanned thru the latest snapshot development zip and scanned NSISUPDATE.exe and found the same file.  I was curious, is this my scanner confusing things?  I looked up totalvelocity on symantec and it said it was a annonymous data sender to totalvelocity.com so that couldn't be it.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming this is either a mistake made by Kaspersky and it noticed similar code.  Or spyware resides in NSIS?  I'm highly doubting theres spyware so I thought I would ask your professional opinion on what this is.<br />
<br />
This exe was from the sourceforge site.  Seems as if that detection came from nsis updater.<br />
<br />
I never ever goto any suspicious sites so I know the exe wasn't &quot;Infected&quot; by anything.  I love your installer system alot and it kind of bothered me to see that odd detection in your software. I know this has to be a simple mistake.  Keep up the good work on NSIS.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

There are quite a few recent threads about this subject, scroll down a bit and you should be able to find all the information you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh sorry.  I did a search before just to make sure and only saw the nsisdl.dll one.  Are you refering to this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yes, but it's the same idea. All are false positives. There is also an old one with McAfee and NSISUpdate.exe. That one can be found in the bug tracker I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, you're right.  Just another screwup at Kaspersky.  Falsely detecting my favorite program in the world.  ^_^.   If only programming languages were this easy... but i love challenges. mwhahahahah.  <br />
<br />
Well thanks for the fast replys and keep up the good work on NSIS.  Its a work of art.  I would get ahold of Kaspersky.com and let them know about their mistake.  Could scare off people people from learning this godly installer system.</div></div><hr />
