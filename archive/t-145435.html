<br />
On the makensisw.exe app - could you add under the &quot;File menu item&quot; the last 5 scripts you loaded into the compiler! <br />
<br />
I work on a number of scripts and would cool to just select the last one I was working with ;-)<br />
<br />
Thanks, and hope you have a good holiday!<br />

did you add it in the Nsis dev (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/) list?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't work for me.  I have a menu item like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
/X&quot;SetCompressor bzip2&quot; &quot;C:\test files\file.nsi<br />
<br />
<br />
And it obviously fails when trying to run it.  Also, it should only show the filename, not the path.  If it's going to show the path, there should be some truncation to the beginning so my menu item isn't longer than the makensisw window itself.<br />
<br />
Also, there should be a way to clear the MRU list.  And files that no longer exist should be removed if you try to run it (and the file doesn't exist).</div></div><hr />

Good point.<br />

I agree.<br />

This is not really standard Windows GUI behavior (check out MS Word, MS Excel, Visual Studio, etc.<br />
But it would be useful, no doubt.</div></div><hr />

That's fine.  I can live without this feature.  I have seen it in several apps, but as long is there is a clear option, it will be fine not to have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">13th August 2003, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, get the latest CVS version and give it another try.<br />
Let me know if you find any more bugs. PM'ing me is probably the best way to do this.<br />
<br />
The Clear option is under the Tools menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">14th August 2003, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Works much better now.  My only issue now is that it doesn't remember my compressor settings (or any /X parameters passed really).  For certain installers, I have to use bzip2, so the MRU doesn't work since NSIS defaults to zlib.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">14th August 2003, 02:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Remembering compressor settings was a feature request that has been shelved for now.<br />
The basic support for this feature is already there in the GUI, but it is waiting on a compressor command line option in makensis.<br />
Using /X&quot;SetCompressor foo&quot; will work most of the time, but if you explicitly set the compressor in your script, it will override the command line option.<br />
If you know which installers need bzip2, why not add the SetCompressor bzip2 command directly to the scripts?</div></div><hr />

Because right now it crashes when using bzip2 :)  Kichik is fixing the problem now though.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to say thanks for doing this! - has saved sooo much clicking around ;-)</div></div><hr />

That's what we're here for.<br />
Please let me know if you run into any bugs with this feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The new MRU feature does not work on my Win98SE system. I am using MAKENSISW.EXE v1.102 from a snapshot downloaded yesterday (21 August). After editing several files, the MRU list remains empty (see screenshot). I have exited and rerun the program but it never shows any MRU entries.<br />
<br />
When I looked at the registry, I found some MRU data in HKLM\Software\NSIS\MRU (entries 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 had the expected data).</div></div><hr />

However, I will review all the API I use to check for OS compatability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">23rd August 2003, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally had to setup VirtualPC with a Windows 98 SE VM to be able to test this. It turns out that MS Windows 9x handles the WM_MENUSELECT message differently from MS Windows NT/2000/XP.<br />
(Why am I not surprised? Its Micro$oft after all).<br />
So I had to overhaul quite a bit of code to get it working. <br />
Anyway, the latest CVS version should now work with Windows 9x as well as Windows NT/2000/XP.<br />
As always, please let me know if you find bugs in the implementation.</div></div><hr />
