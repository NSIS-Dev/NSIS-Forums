If I ever used the file I/O commands I'd be able to help you.<br />
<br />
Looks like a bug to me... Justin?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps you should check the error flag (IFErrors) to see if the file exists first.  The code worked fine for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petersa</div><div class="date">12th January 2002, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose I should have tried it with a file larger than zero bytes. :D<br />
<br />
I just assumed that my CONFIG.SYS file would have something in it. There's Windows XP for you.</div></div><hr />
