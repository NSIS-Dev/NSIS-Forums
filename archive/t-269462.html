<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fishsauce</div><div class="date">13th April 2007, 04:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I came across this site and it talks about changing 'modern' wizards into 'aero' wizards for the Vista look.  Sounds pretty simple: all it takes is one line, but then I'm not sure how the MUI is built so it could potentially be more troublesome.<br />
<br />
Now replace PSH_WIZARD97 in the SampleWizard constructor with PSH_AEROWIZARD and you finally have the new Aero wizard interface:<br />
<br />
Anyways, just wondering if it's possible for someone who doesn't know much about programming like me to build NSIS with this change (or maybe a programming genius can help us out?).  I'm pretty sure this will be a welcome update for the rest of the community as well.<br />

This would require a complete rewrite of the GUI</div></div><hr />

If look and feel is that important to you, you should stick with whatever tools MS provides instead of something that is playing catchup every time a new windows version is released</div></div><hr />
