<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpodtbc</div><div class="date">13th December 2006, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm having a problem over-writing certain files that are in use upon updating my software. the script ensures that all running applications and services are stopped, but certain dlls are not always unloaded in a timely fashion. <br />
<br />
i solved this in the uninstall by writing a custom delete file macro that attempted to delete the file for a specified duration before giving up. it essentially checks for errors and keeps trying again until the timeout has been reached or the file has been successfully deleted.<br />
<br />
i want to do the same thing for file copying because the problem is essentially the same: dll files are still in use and cannot be over-written. but i cannot write a custom File copying function because of the dual nature of the File instruction. i want to pass it a run-time variable but a compile-time constant.<br />
<br />
does anyone know how i could do this without having ugly cluttered code around each File instruction?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpodtbc</div><div class="date">14th December 2006, 08:54</div></div><div class="posttext">meh. i just put a timeout loop around the whole copy files section so it keeps retrying if there are errors until it times out.<br />
<br />
when i have time i'll try your suggestion for individual files.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />
