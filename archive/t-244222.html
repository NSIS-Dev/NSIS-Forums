If you want to create a Self-Extractor, there's a few like NSIS Self-Extractor (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Self-Extractor_kit) and CKV Self-Extractor (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/CKV_Self-Extractor).<br />

<br />
If you want to have the ability to extract files without actually running the install, my suggestions would be to setup some type of command-line function to extract files.  Such as &quot;/e&quot;.  There's plenty of documentation in the manuals for hints on how to deal with reading command line values.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but i have search answer quite long time but have not found it... maby pecause my worst english skils, and wrong search arguments. I have tested that &quot;/e&quot; as argument for compiled plugin installer, but still it want do install progres and not only extract files.<br />
<br />
I think that you try say that i should give that argument for installer compiler, not created Plugin installer? I try search Nullsoft installer compiler and it's manual...<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for you both about answer.</div></div><hr />
