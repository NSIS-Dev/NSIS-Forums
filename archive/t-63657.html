Slate Blue v0.0.30 will soon be released, probably later tonite or tomorrow.  This is the last in the line of old Slate Blue layouts, and is fully functional.<br />
<br />
Slate Blue v1.0 will for sure be released before December 15, 2001, as I am using it as a Science Fair project in my high school Fair.(read below for more info on science fair.)  It will run much smoother, have a more streamlined layout, and contain many more features than the original slate blue, or its competitors :)  It will also contain *NO* 3rd party OCX files.<br />
<br />
I am setting up a forum where you can go and post your ideas/bugs/bitchs-and-moans about slate blue.  To encourage posting, I have removed the need to register; registration is encouraged :)  the url: http://www.morphedmedia.com/sb<br />
<br />
As for Science Fair, I could definitely use some help as to how I can apply this program to the computer science category.  I was thinking the problem could be something like &quot;To use NSIS, the user must learn a new scripting language.&quot;  slate blue fixes this problem :)<br />
<br />
thanks for all your support, dan green</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;NSIS, The premier installer created by Nullsoft Inc., has a hard language to learn. Slate Blue, By Developer Dan Green, can help clear up unknown coding and help others learn the language faster and much easier than learning it 'Cold Turkey'&quot;<br />

P.s. December works for me. I will be working hard though. Once I am finished with the PHP coding, I will be taking VB and C++ classes after school (once I register)!! So, If you need any help whatsoever, just ask. I would believe C++ would be easy, concidering PHP is based off of it. I will also have Toddler of On-Demand Audio finished, so this will be a very eventful week.<br />
<br />
P.s.s. I have Thanksgiving week off<br />
<br />
P.s.s.s. No COMDEX :mad: <br />
