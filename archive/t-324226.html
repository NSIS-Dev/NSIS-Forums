<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">23rd November 2010, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">To do this, simply create your own custom page using nsDialogs. There's an excellent tutorial in the nsDialogs readme (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jiake</div><div class="date">23rd November 2010, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">The second page is one large image on the top, including the title, header image, right image, page text (the four items), so you need only create a custom page with a big image and a label, a link and a combobox. See examples (Examples\nsDialogs) and documents (Examples\Docs) of nsDialogs in NSIS directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jiake</div><div class="date">24th November 2010, 03:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I make a mistake, the documents is in Docs\nsDialogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">24th November 2010, 04:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure that you will be able to change the language on the Welcome page. I am pretty sure that once The GUI is shown, the language is locked. If you wanted that, you would probably need to do a custom page with one installer that then calls a second installer with the selected language.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, it would be cool to have a new NSIS command of ChangeLanguage or something that you could call in this kind of situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jiake</div><div class="date">24th November 2010, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I download the installer of Xobni, I found that the top image and page title image are two separated images. The language selection combobox is only to determine the language of using this software but not the installer, all the steps of setup wizard are Engish. However, I think that you can use header file to define language string and SendMessage to change the default string of the installer in the &quot;SHOW&quot; function of each page, even this is too troublesome.<br />
<br />
Here is an example shows how to create a custom like your image and set the language of the installer to what you select on the fisrt page. Of cource, this is an example, I set three strings of directory page only, you must write and set for each page.</div></div><hr />

This can be done using nsDialogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shazia.parveen</div><div class="date">30th November 2010, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi that is fine but how can we get check box with click and how can we start the application after clicking the finish button any example.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">30th November 2010, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I already told you. There's an excellent tutorial in the nsDialogs readme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jiake</div><div class="date">30th November 2010, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use ${NSD_CreateCheckBox}, ${NSD_Check}, ${NSD_CreateHLine} (Docs\nsDialogs\Readme.html), CreateFont, SetFont (NSIS.chm), define a LEAVE function (see Docs\Modern UI 2\Readme.html for more) for finish page to get the state using ${NSD_GetState}, and then do your stuff depending on the values. Actually these are all in the help files, it would be very easy if you read them carefully and test the examples of nsDialogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shazia.parveen</div><div class="date">1st December 2010, 04:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi jiake , thanks for replying i am going through the documents how can we start an application(e.g outlook)by using the 1st check box and any website by using the 2nd check box on click of finish button ,i have created the check box but unable to open an application and website and  actually jiake  its really urgent i have to complete it by tomorrow end of days any how and you can help me so please help me , waiting for your reply..</div></div><hr />
