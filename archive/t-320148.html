I saw that multiple installation directories have been discussed regularily, but I didn't find this question answered:<br />
When using MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY twice (or more time), is there a way to adapt the amount of storage space required which is diplayed at the bottom left? E.g. the application itself could be installed to C:\Programs while the application configuration is installed to D:\somePath. Currently I'm told that I need several MBs on D: too although the configuration data is just a few kB. <br />
Alternatively is there a way to disable that display because the calculation of the required space may be quite complicated? ;-)<br />
Thx<br />

If you want different space texts on each directory page, you will need to split the components installed to each directory into separate sections and ensure section 1 is deselected before directory page 1 and the section 2 is deselected before directory page 2.<br />

The latter solution works great for me as I have several installation directories so the first one would be an overkill for me ;-)</div></div><hr />
