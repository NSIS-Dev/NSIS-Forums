<br />
The silent installation with MSI is pain for me from days.<br />
I was having MSI 1605 error which I managed to sort it out, but now I am facing MSI 1603 (Fatal Error) Exception on my testing PCs. All of them are non-development machines and so do not have .Net Framework installed.<br />
<br />
There could be several reasons for the above mentined error as under...<br />
<br />
1. This error is known to occur on computers that do not have enough disk space for the installation. <br />
I have almost more then 1 GB place clean.<br />
<br />
2. The Windows Temp directory is not clean. <br />
I have cleaned many of them manually but still the same error<br />
<br />
3. A certain file on the machine is locked. To fix this, close all applications running in the background. Reboot computer and run the installation again. <br />
I have rebooted the PC and tried too.<br />
<br />
4. If you are using Windows 95,98,ME, 2000 or NT, the Windows Installer Service may not be properly installed on the machine. Update the system with the latest Windows Installer service. <br />
I have downloaded the InstMsiA.exe, InstMsiW.exe and even the latest MSI Installer WindowsInstaller-KB884016-v2-x86.exe from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
5. On Windows NT, 2000, or XP, make sure you have administrative privileges. To confirm you have administrative privileges, select Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management. In the Computer Management dialog, click on System Tools &gt; Local Users and Groups &gt; Users. Right-click on the username and select Properties. In the properties dialog, select the Member Of tab and ensure it states ''Administrator''. <br />
That I am checking for sure<br />
I am using NSIS forum function only and that works fine, moreover I am the admin for the test PCs.<br />
<br />
6. Use Microsoft Windows Installer Cleanup utility.<br />
Did tried both with <br />
msicuu.exe and MsiZap.exe<br />
<br />
(I have done almost everything other then going directly to MS headoffice.)<br />
<br />
Hey guys can you help me out on this?<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
