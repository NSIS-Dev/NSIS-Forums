<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kimoy</div><div class="date">2nd February 2004, 04:18</div></div><div class="posttext">hi. is it possible with NSIS to change the modern UI dialogs so we can display bitmap dialogs? i mean, covering the entire dialog with bitmap, is this possible with NSIS?<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

Not sure exacly what you mean but it should be possible although it might involve a lot of work.<br />
<br />
As an example of a modified version of MUI you can have a look at the mod I made which displays bitmaps while installing files.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd February 2004, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">So you want to skin the entire interface? There is currently no plug-in available that does something like that, writing one would require quite a lot of work.<br />
<br />
Actually I don't understand why you would want to skin something a user will only see once (the whole point of skinning is that a user changes the interface to his/her preference). For an installer, it's imo better to use the standard Windows skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shea</div><div class="date">2nd February 2004, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">He's talking about at the top where you put the little 150x57 bitmap. He wants to make it fill up the whole header so it would be like 500x57 or whatever the demensions are of the header of the installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kimoy</div><div class="date">3rd February 2004, 06:30</div></div><div class="posttext">you have seen how commercial installer programs work right? for example, the Wise installer. You can change the background into different bitmap images dynamically. That's what i intend to do with NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">3rd February 2004, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">If you mean the background as in the rest of the screen then check out the bgImage plugin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">3rd February 2004, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">BgImage can't cover the dialog. Your best bet is a good plug-in. You can also create two bitmap controls (edit the UI with Resource Hacker and define MUI_UI to change the UI) and set them like in Vytautas' script, but it won't cover button as InstallSheild does. To cover button you must write a plug-in.</div></div><hr />
