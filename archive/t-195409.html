<br />
I want to install this program for about 30 people who use dial up and it would be nice if after installing the software. A dial up link would be created on their desktop using the &quot;Make a dial up connection&quot; wizard included on windows that would connect to my server.<br />
<br />
It would basically have the windows 98se-XP computer create a dial up connection using a selected modem on their system (which will vary, or I can specify since they all have the same computers with the same modem name) and create a desktop shortcut and when the click on it, it will already have the dial up number I provide and password.<br />
<br />
Thanks and I know this may require using C++ or another program but thought maybe NSIS can influence windows to use it's included features.  This way I don't have to have 30 people getting manuel instructions on setting up a dial up connection.</div></div><hr />
