<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">galil</div><div class="date">18th February 2003, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Situation is, I want to include a console progie to my installer (nsis is the best :)), however it has one anoying (in my case) feature - to quit it you have to press enter-key (i guess it was implemented to let a user see output or something). This proggie works several times during install, and each time user would have to click enter - and that's pointless and irritating.<br />
Is there some way around this, like emulating a key-press? Terminating a dosbox is not an option, I tried it and it messed up the proggie's work.<br />
<br />
PS: I realise that my question is not quite related to NSIS, but I didn't know where else I could ask, and I see lots of experienced people here, programmers and such... :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">19th February 2003, 09:05</div></div><div class="posttext">You could try using FindWindow $0 &quot;Your Window Title&quot;<br />
SendMessage $0 ${WM_KEYDOWN} 13 0(note you have to include WinMessages.nsh to define the WM_KEYDOWN variable). This should send a return key press to the window (13 is the ASCII value of carriage return). (this (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=86) might help give you an idea of how SendMessage can be used)<br />
<br />
Alternatively something like AutoIt (http://www.hiddensoft.com/AutoIt/) can be used to control applications using key presses and mouse actions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th February 2003, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I think nsExec can also help you. As it runs the console application &quot;inside&quot; NSIS it can't get any output so it won't do nothing when the user presses enter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">galil</div><div class="date">19th February 2003, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input Sunjammer!<br />
<br />
Tried that AutoIt thingie, it's cool, never thought such tool existed :up:. It managed to emulate pressing return. But I wasn't totally pleased with the result, to do it the perfect way I'd have to spend time learning it's commands, and frankly I'd prefer to spend that time learning nsis :). Plus it adds another exe to my install.<br />
<br />
So if you said that it's possible to do it with nsis, that would be so much better. And I'll use AutoIt only as a last resort. :) Anyway, I tried to use the code you gave, and it didn't work out.<br />
<br />
<br />
FindWindow $0 tty // FindWindow $0 &quot;&quot; &quot;nop_up&quot; also worked<br />
SendMessage $0 ${WM_KEYDOWN} 13 0<br />
 <br />
code above produces some weird sound from pc-speaker (!?), then writes one random symbol to dos-box - so it kinda gets to work: it finds the right window, and writes to it, but not enterkey.<br />
And out of sudden, sometimes it does nothing at all, sometimes it screws-up the dos-box and one time it even screwed-up keyboard and mouse - they started to work incorrectly. :confused: <br />
<br />
btw, from silliness at first I tried looping it, something like:<br />
<br />
loop:<br />
    FindWindow $0 tty<br />
    IntCmp $0 0 done<br />
    IsWindow $0 0 done<br />
    SendMessage $0 0x100 13 0<br />
    Sleep 100<br />
    Goto loop<br />
done:<br />
<br />
and it worked the same, continuously making eeck-sounds from speaker, writing crap to dos-box and eventually freezing my pc. :mad: <br />
Kids, don't try this at home! :D <br />
<br />
WTH? Any ideas? Note that I have no experience in programming of any sort, and started to use nsis recently. But I'd really like to get it going. :cool:<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
