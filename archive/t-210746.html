<br />
I want to install &quot;Oracle Related Tables&quot; on a System that contains Oracle. (These &quot;Oracle Related Tables&quot; will be used in my Web Application later).<br />
<br />
So, to install &quot;Oracle Related Tables&quot; I have several .SQL Files which I can call through &quot;sqlplus @sample.sql&quot;.  Its easy going when SQLPLUS.EXE is located in my System. I can just write<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;sqlplus scott/tiger  <br />
 @MyDirectory/MySQLFile.sql&quot;   <br />
<br />
MyDirectory is the name of the directory that is present in the same directory where my EXE is present. i.e.$EXEDIR. and this directory contains all my .SQL Files.<br />
<br />
<br />
But, what if, Oracle is not in my System and it is on some other system (say 192.168.20.20) and I want to install my &quot;Oracle Related Tables&quot; on that System? <br />
<br />
<br />
The above code will say &quot;SQLPLUS.EXE not Found&quot; obviously. I need to make this work on Remote Computer.  Something like<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;\\192.168.20.20 sqlplus scott/tiger @MyDirectory/MySQLFile.sql&quot;  (This wont work ofcourse and I need something similar to this that executes my .SQL File using SQLPLUS of 192.168.20.20. i.e. I want to install Tables on Remote Oracle).<br />
<br />
<br />
Please help me......<br />
<br />
<br />
I also tried this:<br />
<br />
          ExecWait &quot;telnet 192.168.20.20&quot; <br />
            <br />
This opens telnet window and upon entering UserName and password, it will remote login and shows DOS Window &quot;C:\&quot;. From here I want to install Tables. How? Even I want to make entering userName and password automatic i.e. from ExecWait. Is my using of Telnet COMPULSARY to install Tables on Remote Oracle? Or is there any other alternative?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th March 2005, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">You could write a batch file on run time (or just extract one to $PLUGINSDIR) and execute it with nsExec::Exec<br />
nsExec::Exec will hide the window.<br />
<br />
So, something along the lines of...<br />
telnet 192.168.20.20<br />
sqlplus scott/tiger &quot;@MyDirectory/MySQLFile.sql&quot;<br />
