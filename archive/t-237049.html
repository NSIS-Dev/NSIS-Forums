<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ross Bradbury</div><div class="date">3rd February 2006, 04:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Using NSIS v2.14 I've noticed this behavior when you make an installer that has a page after the instfiles page in either the Classic and the Modern theme.  Once the files are installed and you are still at the instfiles page that now says &quot;Completed&quot; the Windows close button (the X in the corner of the window) and the &quot;x Close   Alt+F4&quot; option on the system menu (the Alt+Space menu) are enabled but they do not perform any action when clicked.  This has made some users of the installer think that it is hung because it doesn't close when they actually have to click the Next button.<br />
<br />
I bet someone has already addressed or answered this question, but I didn't find this discussed anywhere.<br />
<br />
There are two obvious work-arounds: <br />
1) I leave it like it is. Some users will click the X a few times and then try clicking Next and all will be fine.<br />
2) I AutoClose the instfiles page so they never have a page where the installer is idle and the X button doesn't respond (but the nice log window disappears).<br />
<br />
Is there a way to disable Close in this state?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is some discussion. It's mainly about the cancel button in the finish page. I don't remember if the close button was actually discussed, but they're both related so they will be fixed together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ross Bradbury</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 03:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you both for your reply.  My question was actually about the displayed state of the the close button.  After some confusion and a bit of thought I think I understand how /ENABLECANCEL might relate.  The behavior of the close button must be tied to the Cancel button.  However we should be able to disable the Close item on the system menu to disable the close button whenever the cancel button is disabled.<br />
<br />
I may attempt to execute some API calls myself and see if I can disable the close button before instfiles page using code similar to the code found at http://addressof.com/blog/articles/232.aspx, however I am betting that minimizing and restoring the window will re-enable the close button.  If I actually try this I'll post my code and its results.</div></div><hr />
