How do I rebuild the uninstaller?<br />
<br />
I've looked in the doc page, looked on the NSIS Wiki, read the FAQ and tried searching this forum but have found nothing even close to why I can't build the uninstall. In my code I do have a Section &quot;Uninstall&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you need a separate uninstall.exe at compiletime, you'll have to use !system to call makensis youruninstaller.nsi and then call the created installer which will render you an uninstall.exe which you can use in your actual installer. But in most cases you won't need this at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not 100% true, it is a sort of hybrid between the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T.Slappy</div><div class="date">30th April 2012, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose UNinstaller is built automatically from &quot;Uninstall&quot; section in main script file.<br />
But it is not written to disk - it is created in memory and stored inside installer .exe file.<br />
<br />
During installation a &quot;real&quot; uninstall.exe is written to disk - but it perform exactly the same as mention in section &quot;Uninstall&quot;.</div></div><hr />
