<br />
I'm including a large branding image for both the installer and uninstaller, since it's loaded by both the installer and uninstaller NSIS puts it in the binary twice, making the file much larger.  Any chance we could get some sort of common data block where we can put functions and files that are used with both the installer and uninstaller?  This would help a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">20th November 2002, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe something like the datablock optimizer for both installer and uninstaller.<br />
<br />
Datablock optimizations have the compiler check to see if any data being added to the data block is already in the data block, and if so, it is simply referenced as opposed to added (can save a little bit of size). It is highly recommended to leave this option on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amanda_like_it</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 03:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Any news on this?  My installer is 100k bigger than it needs to be because the branding image is in there twice.  Is this something I can expect to see fixed in the future or should I stop waiting and try to work around this problem? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I would remove the branding images from the uninstaller. If a user uninstalls a product, why should it look fancy? Just my opinion ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amanda_like_it</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, well the problem is with the modern ui AddBrandingImage doesn't work properly.  You have to add it to the modern.exe by editing dialog 105:1033, however this dialog is also used for the uninstaller.  So with no branding image, there is a huge blank gap!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dselkirk</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">just as another option, you can do a silent uninstall. simply display a yes\no msgbox asking them if they want to uninstall. then uninstall the files and display a completion msgbox. no dialogs are shown then, so no worries about including the graphic to the uninstall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amanda_like_it</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose that could work, but it does seem like a work around.  Anyway I like that window that shows the log of what was removed. ;)</div></div><hr />
