I managed to change the Run app text color on the finish page but the box itself always remains white with a black check mark. I changed the bgcolor and colored all texts on the page so this one really pokes my eye. I know there's got to be a solution but I failed to find it.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply and sorry for mine being so late. If it isn't natively supported in nsis, then I guess I'll just leave the damn thing white. I'm afraid your suggestion about subclassing is out of my league; I have very rusty and outdated experience in programming, my last piece of C code I wrote in DOS. But now that I'm playing with nsis, I remembered how much fun it was so who knows, maybe someday my checkbox will be yellow. :)</div></div><hr />
