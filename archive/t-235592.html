<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">16th January 2006, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">there has been talk about converting this to a unicode nature however it involves a substantial amount of work to do this from what i remember being said which would need to be done carefully without breaking it's support/handling of things. alas it's not as easy as a straight recompile with _UNICODE defined. and with only a few people working on the core source code when they have the time to do so, any changes to support unicode would take some time to be implemented. so basically... maybe one day<br />
