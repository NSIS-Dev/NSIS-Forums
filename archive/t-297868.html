I've searched the forum but can't find the answer to my question: How can I disable an InstType from being chosen in the install type drop list on the components page. The scenario is when a user is installing on top of a previous installation, say for an upgrade to a new version. The installation types are 1) full install, 2) minimum install, and 3) custom. The user should not be able to install a minimum installation on top of an earlier full installation. So I'd like to disable, or dynamically remove, the minimum install choice. *But* I don't want to disable the drop list itself, because I still want the Custom choice available. Thanks in advance for any and all help.<br />

However, I'm confused how this would really help you because by keeping the &quot;custom&quot; option, you are still allowing the user to select the same set of options as the &quot;minimum&quot; install.  (I guess to prevent that, you could set some other sections flags to allow the user to pick something less than a &quot;full&quot; install, but more than a &quot;minimum&quot; install.)</div></div><hr />
