<br />
I am little bit new to NSIS scripting, i tried to find a solution to know whether java swing application is running or not before uninstalling it.<br />
<br />
As this is java swing application so there will be no process for this.<br />
Also i cannot set/reset any information in registry while start/stop of application, because may be application crash in between and registry value will be not be consistent.<br />
<br />
Can any one help me to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards!<br />
Asif</div></div><hr />
