<br />
I have an application for which i have $SMPROGRAMS shortcuts to launch the application.<br />
<br />
i.e.<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\My Program\Website.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCT_NAME}.url&quot; <br />
This works well. <br />
<br />
I have been trying to add the Version number of the application to make it show in the $SMPROGRAMS shortcuts.<br />
I have been able to add the Version number to the directory but can not have it appear on the shortcuts, I am trying to add it just the same way as I add it to the directory.<br />
<br />
Like this for the Directory which works fine:<br />
CreateDirectory &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\My Program ${version}&quot;<br />
<br />
and like this for the shortcut which fails to add the version info on to My Program<br />
 CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\My Program ${version}\Uninstall.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\uninst.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this possable to do this with shortcuts, I would have thought it was as it is  a string being added to a string,I would be thankful for any help or if any one can show me what I am doing wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">f1nn</div><div class="date">13th November 2007, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply Afrow, I am still having a problem as it will write the version number to the $SMPROGRAMS <br />
However it wont write it to the shortcuts in $SMPROGRAMS for example I can get My Program  1.0.0.0,<br />
then in the drop down menu displaying the shortcuts My Program, Uninstall, it doesent add the version number, still will have another look at it must be missing something that I should see, will let you know again many thanks.</div></div><hr />
