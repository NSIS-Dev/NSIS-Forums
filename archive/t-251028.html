<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jfix</div><div class="date">13th July 2006, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I've used the EclipseNSIS plugin to create an initial functioning NSI script.  This created among other things the lines<br />
<br />
Name MyApp<br />
# [...]<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULT_FOLDER $(^Name)<br />
<br />
Well, now I wanted to change this value to something else, like this:<br />
<br />
!define COMPANY &quot;Company Name&quot;<br />
# [...]<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULT_FOLDER &quot;${COMPANY}&quot;<br />
<br />
But I can try whatever I do ... when testing the setup.exe the default folder is always MyApp.<br />
<br />
Could anybody please tell me what I am doing wrong (should something else be changed as well, is this an immutable value???).  I spent a couple of hours on this and found no solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I checked that, and it is as it should be.<br />
<br />
However, I tried to understand the following and failed :igor: <br />
<br />
<br />
Var StartMenuGroup<br />
#[...]<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_STARTMENU Application $StartMenuGroup<br />
<br />
Is &quot;Application&quot; some hard-coded symbol, can I change it, why is it called &quot;Application&quot;?  When does the StartMenuGroup variable gets its initial default value and from where ...?<br />
<br />
I wonder whether it's possible to define a Start menu group that's not just one directory deep, but three.  While I know it's possible in theory, I don't know how to do it in NSIS.  <br />
<br />
Help, please?!<br />
<br />
I can provide the nsi file if it helps ...</div></div><hr />

Please do.  <br />
<br />
Here it goes.  I had to remove the corresponding page (one cannot choose the start menu group at the moment) because it was really urgent.  However, I am still really interested in your comments, as this is the first nsis setup I did.</div></div><hr />
