<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th March 2005, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a new Wiki for NSIS. It is meant to replace the Archive. The Archive is great and has served us well, but it has a few problems and no one to fix them. The Wiki also provides many new features such as revision control, public editing and page watch.<br />
<br />
As the main page says, there is still some work ahead, especially moving all of the content from the Archive. I'd also want to create some kind of redirection from the Archive to the Wiki, so it's not just a matter of copying all of the content.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the first step is getting the Wiki up and running, and that's done :)<br />

<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

May I ask please how they got it to change the standard query from ? to / ?<br />
Ie. index.php/Main_Page<br />

<br />
This page (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_Rules) explains how to remove index.php too, but I didn't get to it yet.</div></div><hr />

theres a module available for php, called mod_rewrite, i think  this is behind the / syntax.<br />
<br />
btw: could you port the user-database from the archive to the wiki, so we don't have to re-register? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I passed pages from the Archive to the Wiki successfully using the bot ConversionBot, and of course, with changes (entering Wiki spirit heheh). You can register there and update your pages, but you'll see that there are still things to be done and fixed, like graphics, file upload issues and help pages. Features like pages list for every user will be implemented later.<br />
<br />
Any problems with pages (i.e. pages deletion), and/or you want changes to be hidden (and some other things that I don't remember now) contact administrators that have sysop rights, other problems you should contact kichik. Any feature requests, bug reports... should be posted here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">It is with great pleasure that I announce the Wiki is ready for prime time. Archive content was copied, Archive redirection is in place, uploads work, new skin was created and index.php was removed from the URL.<br />
<br />
We have lots of backups of the Archvie content, so don't worry if something was not copied correctly. Just let us know about it.<br />
<br />
I would like the thank deguix for helping me setting up the new Wiki. He did pretty much everything.</div></div><hr />

If you want, you can create a list of pages created by you in your user page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/User:Afrow_UK). It's very common in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). In addition to that list, you can put some information about yourself in that page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Instructor</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">( wiki main page have IMHO bad navigation. Special pages-&gt; and too long list from which it is need to find. For what those links: What links here, Related changes, Random page, Help, Current events, Community portal? Many archive pages are outdated. Where is my &quot;http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/&quot;???<br />
<br />
PS<br />
But it looks good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The categories (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/Category:Browse) are there for browsing, and are linked from the main page. These categories are a copy of the directories that were on the Archive.<br />
<br />
What links here, related changes and random page are simply useful Wiki links. MediaWiki supplies them by default. Current events and community portal might get content some day.<br />
<br />
Outdated pages can be easily resynced. Lets wait for deguix's comment on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated all pages to their most recent versions before the change &quot;Archive-&gt;Wiki&quot;. All pages were changed by me in someway. Is it for format, scripts or etc.. If you think one of my changes weren't good, you can change them back to your way without problems, that is what a wiki is for. :)<br />
<br />
Or maybe your comment was linked with the Archive not to exist anymore, which means, you're talking about that Archive had  more outdated pages comparing to the current wiki.<br />
<br />
You just need to explain in which meaning you focused your comment.<br />
<br />
Where is my &quot;http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/&quot;???<br />
<br />
The Archive doesn't exist anymore. All links now redirect to their respective pages on wiki, so old links will still work correctly on older threads. The wiki has advantages like accepting the editions from anyone (which can be restricted depending on case), and also having a simpler page sintax. Another reason: contrary to Archive, it is updated as the MediaWiki software is updated, so bugs will be lesser harmful and features can be implemented more easily.</div></div><hr />

There is a contribution page for every user (example). However, you won't find your Archive contribution there because deguix's ConversionBot has created them on the Wiki and not your user. If you want, you can create a list of pages created by you in your user page. It's very common in Wikipedia. In addition to that list, you can put some information about yourself in that page.I could use my bot to produce this type of list from time to time. This was the thing I was thinking since the wiki started but I didn't have enough time to create the code for it. Maybe now with my vacation things can change.<br />
<br />
Also, I was trying to create a more advanced way to categorize pages, instead of just by type. See this page: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/Template_talk:InfoBox_Article<br />
In the example, I was trying to put, for example, the programming language to appear at the &quot;C&quot; category (&quot;C++&quot; cannot be used because of the &quot;+&quot; symbols, they are accepted in place of spaces :(). As the category pages don't exist yet, this has not much of effect (I need to put text in the category page in order to load the category normally). With this, for example, you could categorize all pages that are supported for one OS.<br />
<br />
You can see the TODO list for the bot in this page:<br />

This is very easy in Perl, but I'm not so sure how to do it in PHP. Actually, I thought PHP handles this for you?<br />
<br />
Edit: Nearly forgot to say. Very nice work deguix!<br />
Edit #2: Just one thing, is there links to the sections (e.g. Browse, Download etc. I can't seem to find any (apart from going to a Random Page first). Or am I just blind!<br />

<br />
Just one thing, is there links to the sections (e.g. Browse, Download etc. I can't seem to find any (apart from going to a Random Page first). Or am I just blind! There is no download section, but there is a Special Pages -&gt; File List section where you can choose a file you want to download. Also, I want to focus that the wiki also saves the old versions of the files, just like what happen on pages. (except if you want me to delete them...)<br />

In the old Archive, it was difficult to know which things were changed. I'll re-update them.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Done.<br />
<br />
Probably there are more of those pages because of the timing between the offline and online databases when I finished developing the bot. If your page was not updated properly, post here or on my discussion page:<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/User_talk:Deguix<br />
<br />
I know this because a lot Instructor's pages were updated at a point in time, and this point was when the latest changes page was packed with updated pages in a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The old archive did not save any changes, so the only way to keep it correct was to limit editing to the page author.</div></div><hr />

Please remove my article named 'CharToAscii' from the wiki. Now there is a better way to do the same, explained in the wiki article 'Asc', so there is no need for CharToAscii anymore.<br />

BTW:<br />
It would be usefull to have a direct link to the wiki administrator right in the wiki. This way organisation would become easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th August 2005, 08:09</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no need to delete pages because there might be a better solution. Simply put a link to the better solution. Your solution might be useful to someone after all...<br />
<br />
Why would you need a link to an administrator? Aside from banning and deleting you can do pretty much whatever you want.<br />
<br />
Aaron, SourceForge's servers are built in a cluster. Even though we used their recommended session files location, it's still acting up, as you've noticed. Each sever sees a different version of the session and they're not synchronized. I've tried moving the sessions to the database in the past, but couldn't find any information about it. Today I've got a better lead (http://il.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php), so it just might finally work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th August 2005, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I take that back. The sessions are working perfectly fine. All of this data is already saved in the database. Moving the sessions did solve the previous problems of having to login multiple time, getting blank pages and having to save multiple times until it really saves. Uploaded files are also located in there, and they're working fine as well. It must be some kind of caching, although I must admit a cache that holds up for a couple of months is very strange...<br />
<br />
The correct data is written to the database when setting the preferences. It's even taken into affect once in a while. All I can suggest is to keep reloading.</div></div><hr />
