The title may be a little misleading. The situation is that the application that is being installed updates when it runs, on update, all files and folders within $INSTDIR are deleted and downloaded to replace, that means my uninst.exe is deleted, BUT, is not replaced on update, so I thought, OK,<br />
<br />
 I'll put the uninst.exe in another program files folder,(which can be made especially for the uninst.exe) which will never be touched by the update. So I changed the 2 lines in my script which referenced the uninst.exe location in my registry and the actual creating/placing of the uninst.exe. <br />
<br />
However, the folder is not created simply with these two lines it seems, so was thinking, do I need to create another install directory? and if so, how do i do that?<br />
<br />
Thanks for considering! :o :eek:</div></div><hr />
