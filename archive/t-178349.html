<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thetw</div><div class="date">29th April 2004, 05:00</div></div><div class="posttext">My uninstall always leaves behind the bin directory for some reason. I have tried various things including reordering. I have made sure the directory is empty. Other directories are deleted and all files are deleted.<br />
The command I use is as per the other directories which work:<br />
<br />
  RMDIR &quot;$INSTDIR\Bin&quot;<br />
<br />
Can anybody advise why this might be? <br />
<br />

Try to put a MessageBox command before the command RMDir and check if the folder is really empty, put another one after the command to see if it was deleted. Sometimes it can have an hidden file you can't see too.<br />
<br />
If it isn't solving your problem, try RMDir /r instead of just RMDir, it will remove all files and folders inside the folder you want. But this won't work if there is a running program.</div></div><hr />

I am surprised if the reboot is needed as well...</div></div><hr />
