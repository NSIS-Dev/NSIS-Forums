<br />
I'm new to NSIS, so I hope my question is easy to answer. I'm trying to build an installer with NSIS 2.46. The installer will be run by an administrator and will install the application for all users. The installer extracts many files to the program files directory, a few of which he also edits. Editing is done by means of AdvReplaceInFile (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/More_advanced_replace_text_in_file).<br />
Now I realize that those files that were edited by NSIS lack read permission for standard users. This in contrast to the other files extracted by the installer, which are readable for standard users.<br />
The test was performed under Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Can somebody explain this behavior? Or is it a bug? In case it is not a bug: how can I add read permissions for standard users again?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Remo</div></div><hr />

You can use the AccessControl plugin to add permissions to a file/directory.  By the way, you can examine the current file permissions by first disabling Simplified Sharing in explorer's folder options, and then opening the file's properties (rightclick, properties). It's under the Security tab.</div></div><hr />
