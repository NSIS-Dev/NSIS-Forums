<br />
I am new to all this NSIS stuff but thought that I could use it to extract the MilkDrop presets automatically to the correct installed winamp plug-in path and then the milkdrop directory.<br />
<br />
Instead of giving people a zip from my website.<br />
<br />
I am using the zip converter thing.<br />
<br />
I tried what I though would work.<br />
<br />
(WINAMP PLUG-INS DIRECTORY)\milkdrop\<br />
<br />
But it does not?<br />
<br />
Any ideas people?<br />
<br />
Thank,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rovastar</div><div class="date">4th March 2002, 00:59</div></div><div class="posttext">No response. :(. Oh well.<br />
I have another couple of questions mind.<br />
<br />
- In the Zip2exe converter again.<br />
<br />
In the Default extracter path. What the heck does (WINAMP VIS PLUG-INS DIRECTORY) mean? That to me does not make any sense? Maybe I misunderstand NSIS?<br />
<br />
- ANd how do you get NSIS to extract to the defuault WA3 dirctory?<br />
<br />
- Is it really right that NSIS is better at zipping than winzip?<br />
<br />
I NSIS'ed a lot (684) of small text files (.milks) and the overall size was smaller in NSIS than the zip file - 560K to 494K - is this correct? If so it is amazing stuff! <br />
<br />
I really hope you people can help?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
