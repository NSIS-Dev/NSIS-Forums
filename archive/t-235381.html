My application needs JDK 1.4.2 to run properly. I have bundled a jdk 1.4.2 with my installer. But if at the destination machine a jdk1.4.2 is already installed then i don't want to extract the jdk with the installer. I am able to check if a jdk is already installed or not in the target system but i can not stop copying the bundled jdk when a jdk is already installed on the target system. I have searched this forum and was unable to find any solutions. Any help will be great for me. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I guess i should have tried it before. but i thought that if i use a logical structure before a File command, then may be that file won't get packed with the installer. But i was wrong. I guess that was just stupid of me. Anyway, thanks again.</div></div><hr />
