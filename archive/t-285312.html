<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">20th January 2008, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">nobody knows a way to do  that ?<br />
maybe i nto explained so fine.<br />
<br />
i want to use a image file into the installer executable, but i dont want to extract it to a file. How can i do that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">20th January 2008, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">you can probably add the resource using !packhdr and resource hacker. Reading it from the resource is another matter. IE and some other MS things support the res:// protocol, that might help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">20th January 2008, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">when i tell &quot;resources&quot; i mean into the installer exe made by makensis. I only want to transfer the file from the memory to the plugin to show it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">20th January 2008, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">yes i know what you mean, resource hacker can be called from the command line.<br />
<br />
But why can't you just extract it like a normal file to $pluginsdir?<br />
<br />
Even if it is a resource, people can still make a copy of your image by using resource hacker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">20th January 2008, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">so ewasy to understand why i want that.<br />
Imagine want to use certain images only to show during the install function. Then why we need to extract these images ?<br />
The best would be to load them on the memory and give this memory to the splash plugin, or others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">20th January 2008, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">$pluginsdir is deleted when installer quits, no reason not to put it there. The image is even compressed, if it was a resource, it would not be compressed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">21st January 2008, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">well<br />
<br />
at finally nobody know how to do that ?<br />
i thought can be possible to made on nsis...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">21st January 2008, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">As said use Resource Hacker to add a resource using !packhdr and then use the LoadBitmap API to load it at run time then set it at run time using SendMessage with STM_SETIMAGE.<br />
<br />
To be honest though, what on Earth is the point? There really is no benefits by storing the bitmap in the exe header when you can compress it in the data block.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">21st January 2008, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe you not understand what i want to do. ok i go to repeat.<br />
<br />
I want to use a bmp or gif or jpg. This image is into the installer generated by makensis. But to use this image, i dont want to extract it to a file. I WANT TO USE IT DIRECTLY FORM THE MEMORY. Is that possible with nsis ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">21st January 2008, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is possible. Afrow UK just gave you the solution: add a resource using a command line tool like Resource Hacker (using the compile-time !packhdr command) and load it from your executable using the LoadBitmap API (check the System plug-in for info about calling Windows API).<br />
<br />
Note that your images will be uncompressed when stored inside the installer resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">21st January 2008, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">and we cant add the resource with makensis ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">21st January 2008, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">If makensis could do that we would tell you :)<br />
