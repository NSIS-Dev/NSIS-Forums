<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeeWeTee</div><div class="date">27th February 2013, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
just to verify that I understood it correctly:<br />
<br />
Since i use 32Bit NSIS, i got an 32BIT installer, which by default works in 32Bit &quot;area&quot;.<br />
<br />
#Windows 32Bit:<br />
ReadRegStr HKLM Software\JavaSoft  (e.g. for Java 32 Bit)<br />
<br />
#Windows 64Bit:<br />
ReadRegStr HKLM Software\JavaSoft  (e.g. for Java 32 Bit)<br />
#Got redirected -&gt; thus the key is actually taken from:<br />
#HKLM SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\JavaSoft  (e.g. for Java 32 Bit)<br />
<br />
Is the following the same as above? (Should be :)<br />
#Windows 32Bit:<br />
SetRegView 32<br />
ReadRegStr HKLM Software\JavaSoft  (e.g. for Java 32 Bit)<br />
<br />
#Windows 64Bit:<br />
SetRegView 32<br />
ReadRegStr HKLM Software\JavaSoft  (e.g. for Java 32 Bit)<br />
<br />
If i now want to check the 64 bit &quot;area&quot;:<br />
#Windows 64Bit:<br />
SetRegView 64<br />
ReadRegStr HKLM SOFTWARE\JavaSoft  (e.g. for Java 64Bit)<br />
#No rederection -&gt; thus the key is taken from:<br />
#HKLM SOFTWARE\JavaSoft  (e.g. for Java 64 Bit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">27th February 2013, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, all of the above is correct.<br />
<br />
(Remember to reset regview to 32 after you're done with x64 registry.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeeWeTee</div><div class="date">27th February 2013, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Highly appreciated your confirmation.<br />
<br />
One last thing, I have read that:<br />
<br />
SetRegView 64 <br />
<br />
on a 32Bit system sometimes causes problems. Thus it has to be wrapped with<br />
<br />
${If} ${RunningX64}<br />
SetRegView 64 <br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
But there shouldn't be a problem calling plain<br />
SetRegView 32<br />
on a 32Bit system, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">28th February 2013, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, but I find it highly unlikely that setregview 64 would cause problems on an x86 system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">28th February 2013, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Who said it would cause problems? It just sets an extra flag on the registry API call which older operating systems (i.e. non 64-bit) will just ignore (because they are not aware the flag exists). There is no need to wrap it in an ${If}.<br />

But yeah, I doubt that very much.It was in response to TeeWeTee rather than your post (I should have quoted) - I'm curious as to where he read that it can cause problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeeWeTee</div><div class="date">1st March 2013, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I was referring to the following post:<br />
<br />
SetRegView and DeleteRegKey  (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=284608)<br />
<br />
You should only use SetRegView 64 on XP x64. Not all 32-bit versions of Windows support this flag and some might cause registry operations to fail, just like in your case. <br />
<br />
But maybe I over interpreted it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">1st March 2013, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">That's interesting and news to me. I've used SetRegView 64 on 32-bit XP for years with no issues so perhaps Microsoft fixed the issue with a service pack at some point.<br />
<br />
Edit: Further research suggests that having the flag set will cause registry operations to fail on Windows 2000 - so now I would suggest wrapping it in an ${If} for the sake of compatibility with XP and 2000.<br />
