<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 03:46</div></div><div class="posttext">since i am working on my latest project i need an array for seperate languages which differs from NSIS-system for language<br />
<br />
i do it like this:<br />
<br />
  !define g_active &quot;bla&quot;<br />
  !define e_active &quot;blubb&quot;<br />
  !define f_active &quot;nonsense&quot;<br />
<br />
g e f are standing for the 3 languages and handle in this var $LANGSHORT<br />
<br />
so the message goes like this:<br />
messagebox mb_ok &quot;${$LANGSHORT_active}&quot;<br />
<br />
but i only get &quot;${g_active}&quot; :cry: <br />
<br />
is it possible or not ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure I understand exactly what you are asking. To my knowlege, NSIS does not support arrays.<br />
<br />
But, the way I'm reading your question, it sounds like you simply want to concatenate all g, e, and f variables.  If that the case, then use this:<br />
<br />
strCpy $LANGSHORT_active &quot;${g_active}${e_active}${f_active}&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS dont support arrays - that i found out a longer time ago<br />
some1 has written another solution for that...<br />
search for &quot;array&quot; here...<br />
<br />
but that was not my purpose...<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; strCpy $LANGSHORT_active &quot;${g_active}${e_active}${f_active}&quot;<br />
<br />
$LANGSHORT is a standalone variable<br />
it is possible to combine it with fixed values eg.<br />
$LANGSHORTmenu01.ini (for IO)<br />
but i didnt match it for 2 variables in a box<br />
<br />
${$LANGSHORT_active}<br />
<br />
red is the inner name and green the outer name<br />
${g_active}<br />
<br />
This is the result -&gt; ${g_active}<br />
but it is not handled as a variable any longer, just plain text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">28th January 2005, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, hopefully I've got this all sorted out.  Let's see how I did...<br />
<br />
You have a variable called $LANGSHORT, which can be either 'g', 'e', or 'f'.  You want to take this value and append '_active' to come up with a variable name and then from that return the value of that variable?  <br />
<br />
Based on your example above, it sounds like $LANGSHORT has a value of 'g'.  Therefore, you want to return the value of the variable $g_active, (which is 'bla').  But instead of getting 'bla', you are geting the text '${g_active}'.  (Right so far?)<br />
<br />
While I haven't been able to work out a formula quite on your line of thinking, I did manage to find an alternative that should acomplish the task.  It uses a 5th variable and a string of StrCmp functions to return the proper variable by using a function.  It's goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Function GetValue<br />
    StrCmp $LANGSHORT &quot;g&quot; returnG findE<br />
  returnG:<br />
    StrCpy $0 ${g_active}<br />
    Return<br />
  findE:<br />
    StrCmp $LANGSHORT &quot;e&quot; returnE findF<br />
  returnE:<br />
    StrCpy $0 ${e_active}<br />
    Return<br />
  findF:<br />
    StrCmp $LANGSHORT &quot;f&quot; returnF findNothing<br />
  returnF:<br />
    StrCpy $0 ${f_active}<br />
	Return<br />
  findNothing:<br />
    strCopy $0 &quot;&quot;<br />
FunctionEnd	<br />
<br />
<br />
(This is just a quick example--in practice, you might need to clean this code up a bit.)<br />
<br />
If this doesn't give you want you want, perhaps there's a brighter bulb out there that might be able to offer some other advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what i already had and i want away from.<br />
It blows up my code and theses fragments are thrown all over my code.<br />
<br />
I have to think about an (ini-) array :/</div></div><hr />
