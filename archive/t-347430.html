<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">z01</div><div class="date">27th August 2012, 06:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using the UMUI rather successfully, and have my installer almost complete.  The one thing I've been unable to do is to get UMUI_PAGE_ALTERNATIVESTARTMENU to work.  Specifically, my installer won't even compile when I have that macro in it.  I've also tried MUI_PAGE_STARTMENU with essentially identical results.  My guess is that I'm missing something basic; for one thing, I'm not quite sure what &quot;page_id&quot; is, and there isn't much documentation on it.<br />
<br />
I first tried just putting the following page macro into my list of pages:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro UMUI_PAGE_ALTERNATIVESTARTMENU &quot;RTMT&quot; $StartMenuFolder<br />
<br />
Here, &quot;RTMT&quot; is the name of my application, and StartMenuFolder is an uninitialized variable.  When I try to compile my script, I get the following error messages:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro: UMUI_PAGE_ALTERNATIVESTARTMENU<br />
Usage: StrCpy $(user_var: output) str [maxlen] [startoffset]<br />
Error in macro UMUI_FUNCTION_ALTERNATIVESTARTMENUPAGE on macroline 64<br />
Error in macro UMUI_PAGE_ALTERNATIVESTARTMENU on macroline 80<br />
Error in script &quot;C:\Users\Steve\Documents\SimCity 4\RTMT\Install Main\RTMT_Installer.nsi&quot; on line 91 -- aborting creation process<br />
<br />
Looking at the source, the line numbers all make sense, but I don't know what the underlying problem is.  Then I read that the Registry defines need to be in place for this to work.  OK, so I added them, and now my code looks like this:<br />
<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_REGISTRY_ROOT HKCU<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_REGISTRY_KEY &quot;Software\RTMT&quot;<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_REGISTRY_VALUENAME &quot;Start Menu Name&quot;<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER &quot;RTMT&quot;<br />
!insertmacro UMUI_PAGE_ALTERNATIVESTARTMENU &quot;RTMT&quot; $StartMenuFolder<br />
<br />
And the error messages I get are identical, although line number 64 is now 29.  So then I thought, Well, maybe I need to add the shortcut code.  So down in my section, I put the following:<br />
<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_BEGIN Application<br />
    <br />
    ;Create shortcuts<br />
    CreateDirectory &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\$STARTMENU_FOLDER&quot;<br />
    CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\$STARTMENU_FOLDER\Uninstall.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\Uninstall.exe&quot;<br />
  <br />
  !insertmacro MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_END<br />
<br />
This has no effect at all, and it's obvious  why when watching the compilation:  The compilation aborts before it ever gets to that code.<br />
<br />
So what am I doing wrong?  And what is &quot;page_id&quot; supposed to be?  I've tried putting everything in there, from constants to variables.  The documentation says, &quot;The page ID should be the ID of the page on which the user has selected the folder for the shortcuts you want to write.&quot;  But I don't know what the means, or how to get said ID.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
