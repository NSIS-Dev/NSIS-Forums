<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redxii</div><div class="date">12th May 2009, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the following (assuming you're using MUI):<br />
<br />
!define MUI_LICENSEPAGE_CHECKBOX<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE &quot;agree.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;agree.txt&quot; contains whatever they have to agree to (you change the name of the .txt file)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">12th May 2009, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, but he wants it on his custom page.  For example, he might have a page that checks system resources and determines that the user has only 1GB of RAM which might severely hamper the application's performance.  So he could include a checkbox that states &quot;I accept that because of limited system resources, the installed program may not perform optimally&quot; or somesuch before allowing an installation, to prevent the user from e-mailing about the poor performance.<br />
<br />
anyway.<br />
<br />
IYIaster... the reason you're not seeing it is probably because you made it waaaaaaay too tall; 100% of the page's height, 90 pixels from the top.. probably falls off-screen.<br />
<br />
try '180 90 10u 10u' or '180 90 16 16'.  Note that the size of the checkbox widget itself depends on the width parameter.  The height just ends up creating more space for the text next to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpderuiter</div><div class="date">12th May 2009, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you able to create other controls?<br />
<br />
How about the cÃ¶ordinates of the control?<br />
Isn't the checkbox just placed outside the dialog (thus invisible)?<br />
<br />
I think you should use 'dialog units' instead of pixels anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpderuiter</div><div class="date">12th May 2009, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, you where quicker then me Animaether...<br />
<br />
Anyway, the 100% given was for the width, so that should not be a problem.<br />
And using 5 as height results in a rather small checkbox, but that isn't the problem as well.</div></div><hr />

I had another item on the page was was set to 100% and I think its covering it up. I will look at it tomorrow. Thanks for your help guys <br />
by the way ${NSD_CreateCheckbox} 230 95 10u 10u &quot;&quot; after changing it to that I was able to see 1/2 of the box so I will figure out where I need it tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IYIaster</div><div class="date">13th May 2009, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">ok guys I was able to get the check box to place where I need it. Anyone know how I would config so that they have to check this box before they continue? Also this box will only show up if the resources on the server don't meet our requirements.</div></div><hr />
