Hi,<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out how to get my NSIS setup script to create a directory which will be a junction point to another folder/directory<br />
<br />
I have my application which I am building an installer for which already contains junction-points in its file-system, I am now trying to package up into my NSIS installer by creating each directory and file as represented in my application folder (junctions included).<br />
<br />
I would like to find out if there is a proper way to achieve this purely from within NSIS setup script itself and without having to call a separate batch script on exec().<br />
<br />
For simplicity sake here is a brief example of what I wish to achieve:<br />
<br />
...<br />
section<br />
<br />
CreateDirectory &quot;$INSTDIR\App\Logs&quot;    # &lt;-- This is the actual dir.<br />
CreateDirectory &quot;$INSTDIR\Logs&quot;    # &lt;-- This should be junction of ..\App\Logs<br />
<br />
sectionend<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm an NSIS installer newbie and as yet have not fully understand what NSIS is fully capable of achieving with regards to file/folder manipulation. <br />
<br />
NSIS does look to be very flexible and powerful enough for my needs thus far.<br />
<br />
 -- I would just like to see the basic principle on how to create a Junction-Link from within NSIS. Any old example will do I should be able to figure it out from there ;)<br />
<br />
Anders kindly pointed out in another one of my posts: junction and a symlink is not the same thing! Junctions are Win2000+ and symlinks are Vista+<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
