<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frodrum</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi i am a newbie to programing and I am currently a student who has been posted to a company for attachment. My task in this company is to create an installation disk for one of its applications. First I have to create an installer to install a small batch file. It is a HelloWorld class which i created using java. But i have no idea how to package it into an installer. I have read the NSIS manual and have gone through the forum but don't understand most of the stuff there as the only programming knowledge I have is of Java. I hope you could give me some examples on how to make an installer for a batch file. Thanks!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The simplest installer you can create is this below:<br />
<br />
OutFile a.exe<br />
<br />
Section<br />
SectionEnd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">michaelmross</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">See what each of the scripts in the NSIS\Examples folder does. It's very easy to adapt an existing script. Also try the great wizard that comes with http://hmne.sourceforge.net/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frodrum</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 05:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey it's me again. I have a question regarding one of the examples given in the NSIS examples folder. This is from example2. Here's the code:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Example2 (required)&quot;<br />
<br />
  SectionIn RO<br />
  <br />
  ; Set output path to the installation directory.<br />
  SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
  <br />
  ; Put file there<br />
  File &quot;..\makensisw.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
For the last line (File &quot;..\makensisw.exe&quot;), is the makensisw.exe a file that already exists, one that will be created by the installer or is it the file that i would like to include in my installer.<br />
<br />
And also to change the directory of $INSTDIR i think i need to use StrCpy but i am not sure how to use it. Could someone give me an example on how to do this.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

  SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
  <br />
  ; Put file there<br />
  File &quot;..\makensisw.exe&quot;<br />
It will include the file makensisw.exe in the installer and extract it to $INSTDIR.And also to change the directory of $INSTDIR i think i need to use StrCpy but i am not sure how to use it. Could someone give me an example on how to do this.StrCpy $INSTDIR &quot;C:\YourDir&quot;</div></div><hr />
