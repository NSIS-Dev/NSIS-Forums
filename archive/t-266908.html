<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lmoulder</div><div class="date">2nd March 2007, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I've recently been handed a project that uses NSIS and Ant to create an installer and have run into a few issues I'm hoping someone can help me out with.  <br />
<br />
We're currently using an &lt;exec&gt; task to create the installer and that's working fine.  However, as soon as I use a &lt;sshexec&gt; or &lt;scp&gt; task to try to move the files to another server, Ant hangs at the connection phase.  I've tried to separate the building and publishing into different targets that call each other, and that doesn't do any good.  I've tried calling them both from a single ant call... no good.<br />
<br />
It seems like the only way to get around it is to have two completely separate Ant calls, one to do just the building and another for just the uploading.  And while I normally wouldn't have a problem with this, the build system that this has to go into does so I really need to get it all to happen during a single call.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen or heard of anything like this before?<br />
<br />
I'm running Java 1.6, Ant 1.7, NSIS 2.24, jsch 0.1.3.1.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Leigh</div></div><hr />

The only thing I can suggest is that you take a look at projects using Ant for NSIS, like NSIS Ant Task (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsisant/).</div></div><hr />
