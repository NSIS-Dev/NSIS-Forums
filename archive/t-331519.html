<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hank Scorpio</div><div class="date">13th June 2011, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, I'm a fairly novice user, so bear with me :)<br />
<br />
My current installer uses 2 separate header images; one on the first page, then another for the remainder of the installer. Using MUI, it works as intended. However, when switching to UMUI, I can only see one or the other. I use this line to display what I currently want, but I can only have 1 displayed at any time.<br />
<br />
!define UMUI_HEADERBGIMAGE_BMP &quot;my_header.bmp&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand it uses a different syntax, but I cannot seem to get my installer using UMUI to display both headers. I have everything working as I like it, except for this issue. Is there another way to make 1 header appear on the first page, then make another appear on the rest of the pages? I obviously can't define it more than once, and I'm using &quot;SetBrandingImage&quot; like my MUI script was, but it's not working with UMUI.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Attaching script using UMUI that I am having the issue with. If needed, I can attach the MUI script that works for me.</div></div><hr />

Quick view on your script: are includes correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hank Scorpio</div><div class="date">14th June 2011, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">UMUI version is Version 1.00 beta 2. I installed it from here:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UltraModernUI <br />
<br />
The version of NSIS I am using is 2.46, and as far as I know, my includes are correct. My MUI script is just fine, and my UMUI one is fine as well, save for the header issue.</div></div><hr />
