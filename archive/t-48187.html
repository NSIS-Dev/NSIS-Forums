That way, if there was something you liked about the installation, you could extract the script and have a look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Some (many) authors may not wish you to know their &quot;secrets&quot;, but it's a very simple step to include the .nsi file into the compiled .exe.  I've been doing it for months with a project I've been working on.  It allows me to make subtle changes to the locations and version numbers w/o having to redo everything all the time.  If break something, I just use the last version's installer, and I'm back to where I was before I messed up.<br />
<br />
So what I'm saying is, instead of Justin having to code a way to get the script back from a binary .exe, you (or anyone) can just include it in whatever you are working with (it was my plan from the start to get rid of the .nsi when I left beta, but maybe I'll keep it around {just for you :} ).<br />

<br />
Before I discovered NSIS I had been using Inno Setup (http://www.innosetup.com/), and I had been installing the script as a hidden file, just in case I needed to modify something...but I saw a program that could extract the script from Inno Setup installers, so I thought, hey, why not. :)</div></div><hr />
