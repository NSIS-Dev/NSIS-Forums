<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">8th March 2009, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that such function doesn't exist (yet) in NSIS.<br />
<br />
But I am looking for this kind of functionality, similar to SetShellVarContext.<br />
<br />
That is, be able to modify (with admin privileges of course) either admin's current HKCU, or all existing users' HKCUs.<br />
<br />
I know that HKLM should fit most of such needs.<br />
<br />
However, I have a special need for being able to modify all users HKCUs (in addition to HKLM).<br />
<br />
Is there an existing plugin that does that? or must I enumerate all users' HKCUs in order to accomplish this goal?<br />
<br />
BTW, in my search prior to this posting, I found the following thread, which describes exactly what I was looking for:<br />
<br />

<br />
But while the OP seemed to be satisfied with the HKLM solution, I would still like to pursue this SetRegistryVarContext idea.<br />
<br />
Any tips or thoughts you can share?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Edit: I just discovered the following thread - it seems to provide an idea as to how to go about this:<br />

You really should rewrite your app to just check HKLM first. If you still want to to id, try http://nsis.sourceforge.net/EnumUsersReg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpderuiter</div><div class="date">8th March 2009, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the UserMgr Plugin for this as well <br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UserMgr_plug-in<br />
<br />
UserMgr::RegLoadUserHive will load the HKCU registry hive in  HKEY_USERS/{username}.</div></div><hr />

However, I have one special case in which I have no control over the application (already installed, not by my installer) which requires writing to both HKLM and HKCU to activate a certain feature. That feature needs to be activated for all existing user accounts. :eek: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">9th March 2009, 03:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you explain why it will not work with domains?The solutions mentioned so far read the registry to determine a list of users.  <br />
<br />
On a stand-alone computer that's fine because the local machine is where the user accounts are defined.<br />
<br />
But, in a domain environment, user accounts are setup on a server and don't have to exist on the local computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">9th March 2009, 03:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not even complete on a local machine, my registry is missing ASPNET,HelpAssistant,SUPPORT_xxxxx etc<br />
<br />
The ProfileList key is also undocumented AFAIK<br />
<br />
There are proper API's one could use, but they are a big pain</div></div><hr />
