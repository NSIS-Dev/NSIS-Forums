<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olaf van der Spek</div><div class="date">26th March 2004, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be possible to modify the GetDLLVersionLocal to use the PATH environment variable if the DLL can't be found directly, just like the OS does?<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking is that I don't want to hard-code paths in my NSIS scripts and I want those scripts to work on all systems without modifications.<br />
<br />
I don't want to copy the DLL to the current directory either and I think lots of users that include DLLs would love this feature.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">26th March 2004, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">GetDLLVersionLocal is usually used in conjunction with File. Both don't look in the PATH so you won't include wrong files by mistake.<br />
<br />
If you want your script to work on all systems, you can read environment variables such as WINDIR using $%WINDIR%. For example:<br />
<br />
GetDLLVersionLocal &quot;$%WINDIR%\explorer.exe&quot; $0 $1</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the chance the wrong DLL is being included, especially considering the OS would then probably load the wrong DLL too?</div></div><hr />
