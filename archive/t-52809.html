<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spaetz</div><div class="date">17th June 2001, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">The $0-$9 variables are great, but only valid within a section. I'd really like to just change my version number only once and have it automatically changed in all filenames, descriptions, etc...<br />
<br />
So what I want is a kind of global #define x y, which replaces all occurances of x with y when compiling the installer.<br />
<br />
Like putting: <br />
!const version &quot;0.9&quot;<br />
into my scripts which is simply being replacing occurances of $version$ with 0.9 (or similar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbareis</div><div class="date">18th June 2001, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You could use an external preprocessor such as my free PPWIZARD (this is what I do).<br />
<br />
I have actually created a NSIS add-on (on PPWIZARD download page) for this tool which simplifies the creation of install packages (for example it does ALL uninstall stuff for you - by default). It also by default chooses a version number for you based on the date but it could be picked up (extracted from doco etc) from anywhere.<br />
<br />
There have been quite a few downloads of the header but no feedback. Please email me if you have tried it and liked or not liked it.  It's biggest fault is no doco but the sample is good for starting with.<br />
