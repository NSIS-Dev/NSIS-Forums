<br />
I have a script that uses FindProc to detect if my application is running before attempting to replace the exe, and it worked fine when I was not using MUI.  Now I have switched to use MUI and now the FindProc call always returns 0 even if the exe is running.<br />
<br />
  FindProcDLL::FindProc &quot;MyApp.exe&quot;<br />
  StrCmp $R0 1 0 +3<br />
    MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Close MyApp and retry this install.&quot;<br />
    Quit<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
FindWindow $R0 &quot;&quot; &quot;MyApp Window Title&quot;<br />
IsWindow $R0 0 +3<br />
MessageBox MB_RETRYCANCEL|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION &quot;Close MyApp!&quot; IDRETRY -2<br />
Abort<br />

<br />
That works fine for now, but in the future the title of the window may change dynamically.  Is there a known issue with FindProc that prevents it from being used with MUI?  Is there another way I can determine if a process is running by the name of the exe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">14th July 2005, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">The MUI is just an interface and should have no effects on standard script code. Please attach a minimal example that reproduces the problem.<br />
<br />
It looks like what you are trying to do can be done in an easy and more reliable way using a mutex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muggz77</div><div class="date">14th July 2005, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">That is what I assumed, but I can't get FindProc to work correctly when using MUI.  Maybe I'm missing something stupid, it wouldn't be the first time.<br />
<br />
In this script, I check for iTunes because I am running it, and it skips right thru, as if it doesn't detect it running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">14th July 2005, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the title for FindWindow has to be the complete title, just some of it. Also, you can pass it a window handle too (not sure which param it is) but for Internet Explorer it's ieframe (somthing like that).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Homer1969</div><div class="date">15th July 2005, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Muggz, I ran your script checking for notepad.exe (since I don't have itunes) and it ran as expected.  Stopped when notepad was running and went on through when notepad wasn't running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muggz77</div><div class="date">15th July 2005, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">That is odd, it doesn't work for me.  Maybe I have an old version of the dll?  The last mod date for my dll is 12-25-03</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Homer1969</div><div class="date">15th July 2005, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">That could be it.  Mine is 6/2/2004.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muggz77</div><div class="date">15th July 2005, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">That was it.  I figured it was something stupid like that.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!</div></div><hr />
