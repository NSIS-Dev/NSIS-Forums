<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SeanB</div><div class="date">19th December 2005, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen this question asked a few times on various threads, however I'm not entirely sure I've found a definitive answer.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to do is move the dialogs to the bottom right of the screen, for which I've found a handy piece of script on these forums, and display billboards in the background while files are copying - again I've found the BGImage plugin to achieve this.<br />
<br />
What I also need to do is make the 'copying files' dialog smaller, or be able to make a custom dialog that is smaller, with just one line of text and a progress bar on it. Otherwise the installer dialogs cover up the billboards.<br />
<br />
I've played around with resource hacker and found out how to change the size of ALL the dialogs inthe MUI for example, but I'm not sure still if it's possible to change just one of them.<br />
<br />
Is this possible or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You can hide the main dialog and use the MSIBanner plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/MSIBanner_-_Plugin_to_display_a_dialog_with_a_progress_bar) or the NxS MSI LoaderDlg plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NxS_MSI_LoaderDlg) to show the progress of the installation. I think there might have been an example of that somewhere, but I can't recall where.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />
