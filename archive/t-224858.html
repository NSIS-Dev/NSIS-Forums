<br />
Can anyone tell me if it is possible to do the following<br />
<br />
Create an installer that will install an applications core components then , based upon part of a user entered serial no. display 1 of 2 possible licences and install only those extra components that the user is entitled to under the terms of the  licence agreement.<br />
<br />
I've been asked by my boss to look into this as having this type of multi-installer would save him/the company from having to maintain 2 separate forks of the same application.<br />
<br />
I've no problem getting a 'normal' install working, reading serial numbers from the user, or displaying licence files - but the 'conditional' parts of the installer i can see being problematic (licence files are compiled in ...i think...how can they be displayed selectively if the info the selection is based on is only provided at run time?<br />
<br />
Any (helpful) suggestions welcome<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />

You could also use the &quot;Abort&quot; NSIS instruction selectively in the &quot;prefunction&quot; for all pages except for the serial one. This would make the script more difficult to read, though.</div></div><hr />
