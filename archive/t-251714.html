<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spunklair</div><div class="date">22nd July 2006, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">When I try to download Winamp, I get an NCIS error message:<br />
<br />
The installer you are trying to use is  corrupted or incomplete.<br />
<br />
Thing is, I have a new pc with XP Home, and I just downloaded the latest NSIS version, and I have checked it and there is nothing wrong with it. I also tried to turn off my virus software (and all the others) and that didn't work.<br />
<br />
Is there anything esle I can do?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you say you've installed NSIS and it's a new PC, you probably just need to download it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">11th June 2007, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Has there been any more progress on this subject?  That link to the NSIS page detailing &quot;the answer&quot; is not exactly what we would want to refer our customers to.  I have read other discussion in the Winamp arena and am wondering if the occasional customer who bumps into this error while downloading our product (71 megs) is using Firefox.  Is it a bug in fact; is it an imcompatibility?  Is there something more reassuring and straightforward that we can say to our frustrated customers?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">11th June 2007, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You should tell them that the installer was not downloaded fully and that they should download it again. If the problem persists, ask them to try downloading using another web browser.<br />

I will make it a point to get accurate information from affected customers. If I get something worth recording, I will make the appropriate edits.</div></div><hr />
