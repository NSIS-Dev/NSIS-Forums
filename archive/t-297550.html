<br />
I Am building a installer that downloads the files need for a Game MOD for Battlefield 2.  It's called SandBox.  Some of you may have seen it about.<br />
<br />
Anyway we want to try a new way of letting user install the MOD.  So we have come up with the way of a small app/installer that in turn downloads the rest of the game files needed using the BitTorrent protocol.<br />
<br />
I Have got most of it done.  In fact the installer is in a working state right now.  But I am having issues in regards to 2 pop up (I think they are called Message Boxes &quot;MB_OK&quot;) windows that appear when the user has a problem with his/hers internet or when he/she presses cancel haft way into the download of the files.<br />
<br />
I Just can't seem to work out where in the .nsi scripts this info is.  so I can't change it.  It maybe to do with the fact that is might be somewhere in the extra plugins that I am using that use Python.  I Am just unsure.<br />
<br />
So I am looking for a some bit of help at this last stage.<br />
<br />
The list of plugins I am using are below<br />
<br />
nsPython<br />
BattleTorrent-0.0<br />
<br />
All I want to do really is change the output of the 2 message box windows to say something like &quot;Please rerun the installer to finish the download&quot; and the 2nd one to say &quot;There is a problem with your internet connection please check your settings&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can download the release candidate here so you can see what I mean about the 2 MB_OK windows.<br />
