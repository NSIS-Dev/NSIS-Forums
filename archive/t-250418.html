<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reebes</div><div class="date">5th July 2006, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly advise that NSIS should enhance web install feature.<br />
<br />
Like Wise, if user turn on option of web install, wise will split files automatically. In that, we could write one code for web install and full install with changing the switch. I think it is much easier for development. But in NSIS, it seems we have to write code to implement it.<br />
<br />
I hope to use NSIS, but because of this feature, I have to give up it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is part of what makes NSIS so flexible. <br />

Anyone has the ability to post their creations to the wiki for others to use. Why not show your support and add your own creations?</div></div><hr />

As a programmer, I also like to create anything by myself. But I even more like I could resolve problem quickly and I couldn't spend much time on making a better install tool or other tools. It is major function of a special tool. Of course, if we could expand many basing on a professional tool by ourselves, it is better.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am trying to add something into NSIS to expand its functions.:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, reebes, I've been working on a technology that not only adds web install features to NSIS, but it does so in dramatic fashion using a custom scripting language and 7-zip compression. No kidding. It's called CMPS, which stands for Component Manager Packaging system. It's currently in alpha stage and it isn't very well documented yet, but search the ExperienceUI forums and you'll find some information on how to use the packaging system. You'll want to install both the CM alpha and MkCMP, which will generate a CMP file based on the contents of a directory. I'd also highly recommend that you install 7-zip, www.7-zip.org. It's not required but it can make working with package files a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Download it from http://xpui.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=193#193. Read the post first. You may also want to read this thread (http://xpui.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12).<br />
<br />
Edit: as far as I know, the version of Component Manager that supports CMPS is only compatible with ExperienceUI 1.11pre. You can get the ExperienceUI from here (http://xpui.sourceforge.net/).<br />
