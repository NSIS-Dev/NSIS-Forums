<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">3rd June 2004, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for the fast replies on my last Questions<br />
but I have another stupid one:<br />
<br />
I want to show the user a overview about his input<br />
until now I have used a label to realize that, but I found out that long input is automatically shown with Linebreaks<br />
<br />
and because of this the place isn't enough<br />
<br />
(I'll attach a pic of this)<br />
<br />
So I wanted to ask if there is a way to show a <br />
<br />
NON changeable textbox or anything like that with scrollbars<br />
<br />
any idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use a &quot;Text&quot; control, set the flags HSCROLL|VSCROLL|READONLY.<br />
<br />
Thx for the fast replies on my last Questions<br />
but I have another stupid one<br />
 <br />
<br />
It's not a stupid question, but again the answer is in the doc. <br />

<br />
Ok, I must admit that I would find more solutions myself If I could get more sleep through the night<br />
<br />
thanks for your indulgence (don't know if this the right word - in germany we say &quot;nachsicht&quot;) and of course your help</div></div><hr />

From the IO2 Readme:<br />
<br />
Flags 	(optional) This specifies additional flags for the display of different controls. Each value should be separated by a | character, and you should be careful not to put any spaces around the | character.<br />
<br />
Value: MULTILINE<br />
Meaning: Used by &quot;Text&quot; controls. Causes the control to accept multiple-lines.<br />
<br />
Value: NOWORDWRAP<br />
Meaning: Used by &quot;Text&quot; controls with multiple-line. Disables the word-wrap that occurs when long lines are entered. Long lines instead scroll off to the side. Specifying the HSCROLL flag also has this effect.<br />
<br />
Value: HSCROLL<br />
Meaning: Show a horizontal scrollbar. When used by &quot;Text&quot; controls with multiple-lines this also disables word-wrap.<br />
<br />
Value: VSCROLL<br />
Meaning: Show a vertical scrollbar.<br />
<br />
Value: READONLY<br />
Meaning: Used by &quot;Text&quot; controls. Prevents the user from entering or editing text in the edit control, but allow the user to select and copy the text.</div></div><hr />
