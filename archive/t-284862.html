<br />
Perhaps this is an easy and/or replied question, but I have searched in the forum and I can't find the answer.<br />
<br />
I am building an application that uses the &quot;multilanguage.nsi&quot; script from NSIS MUI Readme for language to be selected by the installer's user.<br />
<br />
The question is I wanted to translate manually some &quot;messages&quot; of the installer according to the selected language, but I don't know how to get which is the one the NSIS has selected by the related procedure.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me where I can find that?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zinkyu</div><div class="date">26th February 2008, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a similar problem in the same vein.  I've already got my LangStrings working just fine.  However, I want to detect the user's selection for a different reason.  Based on the user's selected language, I want to be able to copy the appropriate translation for my application.  So is there a way to find out which language the user chose from MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zinkyu</div><div class="date">26th February 2008, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevermind.  I found a way.<br />
<br />
After displaying the dialog, I write the selected language to the registry using the MUI_LANGDLL_SAVELANGUAGE macro.  Then I read the value from the registry and compare that to the value for the language.  I find that I'm going to have to run the example a couple of times to get the value for any language I plan on using from now on.  But at least it's a start.</div></div><hr />
