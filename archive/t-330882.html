<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnChen</div><div class="date">24th May 2011, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to delete two folders and all of their contents by calling rmdir /REBOOTOK /r,<br />
<br />
rmdir /REBOOTOK /r folderA<br />
rmdir /REBOOTOK /r folderB<br />
<br />
The problem is that sometimes it failed to delete folderB. I need to call Sleep between them then it is fine to delete both of them,<br />
<br />
rmdir /REBOOTOK /r folderA<br />
Sleep 1000<br />
rmdir /REBOOTOK /r folderB<br />
<br />
I wonder if it is just a coincidence. Or calling Sleep in this situation makes a lot of sense? Thanks.</div></div><hr />
