<br />
I got a little problem with the finishpage-link. I think it's not a NSIS-failure, but maybe you can help.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
The target of the link is a pdf-file on the user's hdd. If there's no pdf-reader installed on the user's system, nothing happens. In the decription of the link isn't mentioned, that a pdf should open, so the user thinks that the link is dead or something.<br />
<br />
Sure it isn't your problem (we should unpack a txt-file or stuff), but maybe you can help me to show an error-message or something like that? Or how to modify the onclick-event?<br />
<br />
mfg,<br />
<br />
Huette.<br />
<br />
P.S.: Thanks for your great support the past months!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">23rd November 2005, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">To sort this out you'd need to add the NOTIFY flag to the link field in $PLUGINSDIR\ioSpecial.ini with WriteINIStr. Then in your MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_LEAVE FinishLeave function, you check the Settings &gt; State of the ioSpecial.ini file to see if the user has clicked on the link and in there you can check if Adobe Reader is installed (somehow).<br />
<br />
Or you could find out if Adobe Reader is installed and then delete the link field before displaying the finish page.<br />

If it's there, some program is likely associated with the extension, and that's likely to be a reader/editor/thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That means that i can show a message after closing the installer like &quot;You tried to open..., but no pdf-Reader is installed...&quot;, doesn't it? That would be better than showing nothing, but it would be great if i could show it directly after the click on the link. I wonder why the standard-windows-&quot;Choose a program to open the (unknown) file&quot;-message (don't know the English text exactly) doesn't appear. Isn't that possible?<br />
<br />
My alternative would be: check if pdf-reader is installed (like Animaether described),unpack a txt-file if it is not and direct the link to the text-file.<br />
<br />
But txt-files aren't that nice. A &quot;please install acrobat reader&quot;-message would be nicer.<br />
<br />
thanks so far,<br />

<br />
<br />
Hmm...sounds complicated...don't know where i should start. Maybe i should invest more time, but i think i ain't got enough of it here on work. Or isn't it that difficult? A few further informations would be great. Or where can i read about it?<br />
<br />
The ExperienceUI? Never heard about it. Sounds good, but i've done Setups/Updates for several products and i don't want to convert(?) them all to ExperienceUI.<br />
<br />
Maybe my wishes overtop my commitment. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
