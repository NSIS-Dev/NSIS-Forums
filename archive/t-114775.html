<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mottel</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 05:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The syntax Pop &quot;&quot; produces a compile error; but is there an alternative that lets you pop into thin air?  i.e. without saving the value into a user-variable?  <br />
With only 20 user-variables, and all global, variables are a precious commodity in NSIS. ;) and I'd like to avoid using one where I don't need the popped value, e.g. where I'm only popping the stack to restore it to its previous state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use a variable to pop and reuse it (overwrite) when you need to give it an important value.<br />
<br />
If you really use all 20 variables and you still want to pop, then first push one variable onto the stack, switch the upper 2 stack items and pop twice. Like:Push $0<br />
Exch<br />
Pop $0<br />
Pop $0<br />
and $0 will still have its own value, but now you deleted the top entry of the stack (so without loosing variables). You see, NSIS is so flexible, there is always a workaround for these things!<br />
<br />
Have fun, good luck,<br />

<br />
Exch $0<br />
Pop $0<br />
<br />
should work too, and it's a bit shorter ;)</div></div><hr />

I like efficient coding :)<br />

<br />
Yeah, ... it's true that there are alternatives, but I still think that you should consider allowing the syntax: pop &quot;&quot; .  It would be the natural 'mirror' instruction to: Push &quot;some string constant&quot;. (Must admit though, Kichik's method *almost* makes it redundant. :up: )<br />
<br />
(BTW, Kichik:  I realised afterwards that &quot;bitza&quot; should have been &quot;batzea.&quot;  Although my (Alcalay) dictionary does give &quot;bitza,&quot; it seems that it's not used in that form in the vernacular.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th November 2002, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's the same in ktiv haser ;)<br />
When I read it first I thought it was already batzea so I just assumed you somehow crossed a few letters in the English writing.</div></div><hr />
