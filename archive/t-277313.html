<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ncsengodi</div><div class="date">14th September 2007, 07:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
I wrote a small test installer to simulate my problem.<br />
<br />
The installation works fine, but the removal part has a bad result.<br />
<br />
I started the &quot;Add or Remove Programs&quot; in Control Panel and I selected the remove button at my program.<br />
During the removal action it executed the notepad.exe.<br />
<br />
After finishing the the uninstallation I didn't was able to use the &quot;Add or Remove Programs&quot; until I killed the notepad.exe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly is it that you want to do? open a url? I came up with a hacky solution to that in http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=272793<br />
<br />
You might want to look into using DDE or something like that so you don't start a new process (Using DDE will only work with explorer.exe since you &quot;know&quot; its probably running)<br />
<br />
There is another possible solution I have not explored, windows uses a job object to keep track of all your uninstall processes, but it IS possible to get out of a job group unless the ARP app restricts that (I see no reason why they would do that, the job object in this case is for older uninstallers, and not security)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ncsengodi</div><div class="date">14th September 2007, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">My original installer has a Modify/Repair/Remove featur like in several InstallShield installer.<br />
<br />
In Modify mode some components can be add or remove and it restarts a small system tray application.</div></div><hr />

edit: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Escape_ARP_Job_With_New_Process (Not sure if I would call this production ready or anything like that, I did not do alot of testing, you have been warned)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ncsengodi</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The Escape ARP Job With New Process soulution works fine on Win2000/WinXP/Win2003 systems, but on Vista it fails.<br />
<br />
The gui part of the add/remove can be closed, but you can't do any other modifications before kill the new process or restart .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Vista might be using a different name for the job, or has secured the job so you can't access it. Or are you saying it sort of works on vista? I don't really understand what you mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ncsengodi</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I modified the sample script with your &quot;Escape ARP Job With New Process&quot; solution.<br />
<br />
On Vista the add/remove doesn't blocked after uninstallation, but I cannot remove any other program before closing the notepad.exe.<br />
<br />
I didn't find any job object in the related processes with process explorer (run as adminstrator).</div></div><hr />
