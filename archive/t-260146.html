<br />
Like many others, I have tried to use the following solution so that my uninstaller will only install the files that it actually installed in the first place:  <br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Uninstall_only_installed_files<br />
<br />
However, I'm having problem with directories that are under my main install directory.  For example, I have folder called QOCForms that resides under the main install dir, and it contains some pdf files.  I cannot get the above solution to get files from that directory. <br />
<br />
I have attached my nsi file that I'm trying to use.  I always have trouble starting at line number 143.  Here's the relevant messages from my compiler:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro: File<br />
IfFileExists: &quot;$OUTDIR\*.*&quot; ? +2 : <br />
FileWrite: $OUTDIR\*.*<br />
<br />
-&gt;$UninstLog<br />
File: &quot;$INSTDIR\Support Files\*.*&quot; -&gt; no files found.<br />
Usage: File [/nonfatal] [/a] ([/r] [/x filespec [...]] filespec [...] |<br />
   /oname=outfile one_file_only)<br />
Error in macro File on macroline 3<br />
Error in script &quot;C:\SuperCD75\FarrSuperCD8.nsi&quot; on line 145 -- aborting creation process<br />
<br />
I don't understand the part about no files found.  There are definitely files in that directory.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />

It doesn't only tell you it cannot find the files, it tells you which files. It tells you it cannot find $INSTDIR\Support Files\*.*. The problem is $INSTDIR isn't defined until the installer is actually run. It's a runtime variable which are you using in build time. You shouldn't use $ISNTDIR for ${File}, just like in the example.</div></div><hr />
