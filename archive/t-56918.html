<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">12th August 2001, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Slate Blue, my GUI for NSIS, has reached a phenomenal point: it will now parse &amp; load settings from scripts.  the only setback is that it only loads the nsis options that it supports.<br />
<br />
http://www.morphedmedia.com/slateblue/SlateBlue0025.exe<br />
<br />
it now comes with its own NSIS installer, with the script created by Slate Blue.<br />
<br />
I have also put up the info page on it, at:<br />

<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 00:30</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not exactly sure what you mean.  can you expand on &quot;add something that adds attributes from a pull down menu&quot;?<br />
<br />
also, what do you mean, &quot;it was a good idea&quot;?  the parsing, or the whole program.  isn't it a good idea anymore? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 00:45</div></div><div class="posttext">It is still a good idea, but it needs more work. I know this sounds demanding, but that is what you have to expect. When I said, &quot;add something that adds attributes,&quot; I ment that (if it is possible) have something that would add items and other flags or compiler attributes ($INSTDIR, $WINDIR, IfFileExists, etc.). Plus, have something that would add expandablity to the program (like a Text document that allows a user to add the attributes or some text document that can be updated/upgraded when &quot;patched&quot;). These are my ideas, I hope you like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">so a dropdown menu containing different compiler/script options, rather than textboxes doing the same thing?  like a dropdown that, when an item is selected, an inputbox pops up and the user is asked to enter say $INSTDIR?<br />
<br />
and the text document idea, you mean like macros, or just being able to edit the script while inside my program?<br />
<br />
thanks, i appreciate the criticism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The pull down is an GOOD IDEA. But the text document I was talking about was something like a webserver's .conf or a .ini would work. That way, you could edit a text document and not have to do much updates, just a text document. I would not know how this work properly, but if you need help, just reply. Also, add a plug-in (.dll or something like that) that could add expandablity to the PiMP install system (http://www.winamp.com/nsdn/pimp/). Just a thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 01:21</div></div><div class="posttext">an .ini file that has basic settings, then the user just changes the specific settings?<br />
<br />
plugins would be nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, but have a default .ini file included just in case that the user messes up. I thought you might like the idea of plug-ins, that way, (if you added the source to do this) other developers that created their own Enhanced NSIS language could add expandability. Like this (http://64.12.38.241/showthread.php?threadid=55510). <br />
<br />
Plus, I'm working on an NSIS Project House on SourceForge.net . If I could get your permission and the program, I would like to add it to the website. :D :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">i am releasing the source to it, and i will let you post it on your Sourceforge site.<br />
<br />
can you just link to the file on my server, so i can accurately track downloads, or does it have to be on sourceforge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">It can act like a mirror, but if you don't want it on the NSIS site, then I will link it to your site, just let me know when a new release is coming before you release it, that way I could update the site.<br />
<br />

P.s. If you do host it, then that will free up space for me. :p :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking, if you signed up at SourceForge, then I could make you an Admin.<br />

<br />
for now, the source is on planetsourcecode.com/vb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th August 2001, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I will try and get it up there for right now, but I am having trouble uploading the site. So, I will create a site in PHP and I will add it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">14th August 2001, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I made an actual GUI for NSIS a while ago, I just updated it with the latest downloadable NSIS source code and exe header. I.e. you dont need the seperate makensis.exe console program.<br />
<br />
Included is source code to the project and makefile.<br />
<br />
http://www.windridge.junglelink.co.uk/nsis.exe<br />
<br />
- note this was more of a slap dash effort to get a gui on NSIS at the time. It probably contains a few bugs, but works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">14th August 2001, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Can I see the actual program???<br />
<br />
-DJ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">14th August 2001, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">My version of makensis.exe is included in the afore posted URL. My website is down at the moment, but when the kind people restart my RAQ3, I will put a link there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">15th August 2001, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I decided that I would be terrible at writing a GUI so I decided to contribue makensis.dll to the cause of an NSIS GUI.<br />
<br />
Using the DLL would probably be a little quicker than running the console version and it has an easy callback function to allow logging in a window or something.<br />
<br />
it can be downloaded at http://www.windridge.junglelink.co.uk/nsisdll.zip (headers and .lib file included, but I dont know about using it in a VB project).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 01:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohh, I can put an NSIS GUI project on the NSIS Project House Website. That way, we could have submissions of things like DLLs and Sources. Now, If I could only upload to the SourceForge Website.<br />
