<br />
Just looking from some information on the differences between LZMA Solid vs. not Solid.  I have an installer that I'm sending out containing ~250 files.  Non Solid gives me an EXE of 2416 KB, where Solid gives me 1588 KB.  Whats the draw back on Solid?  Thanks all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">21st October 2005, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">With solid compression, files are uncompressed to temporary file before they are copied to their final destination. With large installers, this might be a problem when it comes to required hard disk space. But for 3MB, like yours, there's no reason not to use solid compression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jnuw</div><div class="date">21st October 2005, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks kichik.  I tried wrapping up a very large installer a while back, where with solid compression one of my co-workers noticed the installer or their computer locked up.  When I gave them the larger non-solid exe, it worked fine for them.  The source files for that update included over 1200 files and was over 320 MB in size.  <br />
<br />
Basically, my question is this, is there a certain size at which going from solid to non-solid is advisable to avoid any HD space or PC lock-up problems?  I know its a tough question, but any insight you could provide would be wonderful, thanks much.<br />

If it's a local network, use fast zlib non-solid compression. If it's for heavy users who like to get the latest on everything, use lzma solid compression, even for very large installers. If it's distributed on a CD-ROM and fits without solid compression, don't use solid compression. etc.</div></div><hr />
