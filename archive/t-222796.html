Hi, my name is Olajide Olaolorun and i am the Project Manager for a open source project on SourceForge.NET called Uniform Server.<br />
<br />
Currently we have been trying to go ahead and start new things, but we need a good NSIS Programmer that can help with the installers and so on.<br />
<br />
We are looking for a expert NSIS Installer Creator. Someone who is good at doing this and will like to help out the open source community. Knowledge of HTML, PHP, Perl, VBScript, C++, and so on are not needed, but will also be good....<br />
<br />
If you are intrested, please send an email to: dev@uniformserver.com<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
