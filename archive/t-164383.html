<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John P.</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry about the bumping of the thread, but I have the same question, and it seems nothing I do with SetDetailsPrint and DetailPrint changes the text just above the progress bar.<br />
<br />
I have tried putting SetDetailsPrint none, I have tried SetDetailsPrint listonly and SetDetailsPrint textonly, each time putting this in every section(multiple component sections).<br />
<br />
I have at the same time had DetailPrint &quot;Extracting and installing files... Please wait.&quot; in every section.<br />
<br />
None of this changes the text directly above the progress bar, in fact it doesn't seem to have any impact at all, except perhaps on the details window, which I BTW want to disable by using ShowInstDetails nevershow(that last part works btw, so I don't have a problem with that. But I have tried to change the progressbar text both with and without showing install details).<br />
<br />
<br />
So could some kind person please give a bonehead an example of how to change the progress bar text from Extract: MyFile.txt to Extracting and installing files... Please wait. ?<br />
<br />
I'm using the modern user interface, if that's of any importance.<br />
<br />
Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />

However, it may be that the thread you linked to gave me an idea of what I'm doing wrong anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks(so far).<br />
<br />
 Yup - thank you, it turned out there was one small thing I was missing in my script, but the thread you linked to gave me an example, and now it works. :) Strange thing is that I have actually looked at that thread before when I was searching, but then I didn't think it had anything to do with my &quot;problem&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John P.</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">-Actually, it turns out I do have the same problem as you described in that thread.<br />
<br />
I'm not using NSISdl though.<br />
<br />
When I choose to install all the components in my installer(all checkboxes checked), the text above the progress bar is now showing the text I wanted it to as it progresses; something like &quot;Extracting and installing [file].... Please wait&quot;.<br />
<br />
BUT - - when it reaches a certain component, the progressbar text stops refreshing, and is showing the text that pertained to the former section.<br />
<br />
I know this is what happens, 'cause at this point my installer does what I want it to(works).<br />
<br />
I have ten components; ten separate sections you can choose to install(and also uninstall when it comes to that). <br />
<br />
Each component is a little different, because they manipulate a different number of files. <br />
<br />
So I noticed that when one component which is only supposed to manipulate two files was executed(this is when I choose to install all the components), it &quot;looked like&quot; it was manipulating a lot of files. But what was really happening was that the progress bar text hadn't jumped to this section, but was &quot;hanging&quot; on the former section(which manipulates a lot of files), which was what confused me.<br />
<br />
-If I choose to ONLY install the component that seemed to manipulate several files(and is only supposed to manipulate two files), it really does only manipulate the two files. So I know it's not something else wrong.<br />
<br />
-So, if it would work for me perhaps - what command do I use to &quot;send a paint message to the window&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't tried it yet, but the following may resolve it.<br />
<br />
Try creating an empty non-readable section as the last section and in it use setdetailprint with a, &quot; &quot;, (space) as the parameter. This may at least empty the field. Otherwise it's a call into the system.dll to refresh the window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dRaakje</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">What you do is the following:<br />
first: SetDetailsPrint none<br />
<br />
Then whenever you want to set the text to something do the following:<br />
<br />
SetDetailsPrint textonly<br />
DetailPrint &quot;I'm now doing somehting&quot;<br />
SetDetailsPrint none<br />
<br />
That's how I'm doing it.<br />
