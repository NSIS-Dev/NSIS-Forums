<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veerugadde</div><div class="date">8th May 2007, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to develop a installer which allows to install the .msi packages on the user system. Our main requirement is to protect the copyrighted softwares , as we are going on community development project.<br />

<br />
            Can you give me an idea about an approach of protecting copyright of package installed through .msi?  For  example ,if the user have .exe file, they can copy over to other systems for illegal use. I hope made my query clear enough and really sorry as i am new to this field.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
The installer is just responsible for placing files and configuring the user system, unless you implement a security system between the software and NSIS installer.</div></div><hr />
