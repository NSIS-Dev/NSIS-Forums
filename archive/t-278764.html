<br />
During an installation process I need to create a link in the start menu and in case we are on Windows Vista I need this link to have &quot;Run as administrator&quot; option checked.<br />
<br />
The link is to Windows component (rundll.exe), so I can't achieve this by adding a manifest to an exe.<br />
<br />
Is this possible with NSIS?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">12th October 2007, 00:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Createshortcut does not support this. You could create a small wrapper program with a manifest that exec's rundll32 (you could create the app in nsis even)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzech</div><div class="date">12th October 2007, 02:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I use rundll.exe to execute the function in my dll. So theoretically I could provide a standalone exe for that. However I put that inside a dll long time ago (before Vista) because I wanted to make things simpler.<br />
<br />
Anyway I noticed that on Windows Vista it's the 21st byte of the .lnk file that marks whether the shortcut is launched with elevated rights or not. I could simply modify that byte after .lnk is created (in case we are installing on Vista), but that would be an ugly hack.</div></div><hr />

It was beyond me to write it in NSIS script so I put it into the dll, and called via rundll32 upon sucessful install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hichhiker</div><div class="date">17th June 2008, 04:27</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I am not sure if there is something is wrong with this method, but I came across this and have not seen a reference to it anywhere on NSIS forum. I think it is way easier than anything else proposed here and seems to work great.<br />
<br />
Basically the &quot;Run As Administrator&quot; is simply a registry value stored in &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\layers&quot; , so you can use:<br />
<br />
<br />
 WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\layers&quot; \<br />
&quot;$MY_SHORCUT_OR_EXE&quot; &quot;RUNASADMIN&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
Obviously replace $MY_SHORCUT_OR_EXE with your executable or shortcut. You can replace HKLM with HKCU for user specific setting instead of all users.<br />
<br />
<br />
I figured I'd share.<br />

None taken. I am curious myself how come this never came up here. I am no expert on Vista, (having ran it for the first time yesterday)I am updating my &quot;roll-your-own&quot; OpenVPN package to support Vista and ran into this need. It works for me, auto-prompting to up privileges every time I run whatever I put into the reg. The only issue I still have is the running  apps with &quot;run-as-admin&quot; automatically at login. For some reason instead of prompting the user, it just blocks it forcing the user to run it manually :-(<br />

<br />
How would this effect the shortcuts/exe's functionality in xp?<br />
<br />
<br />
you mention $MY_SHORCUT_OR_EXE .. does this mean if you have an exe in programfiles and a shortcut to that on the desktop and start menu you only have to do it once for the exe and all shortcuts to that would be fixed or do i have to do it once for all shortcuts and for the exe .. exact details are crucial to not having to fart arse around guessing how it works<br />

<br />
&quot;The only issue I still have is the running apps with &quot;run-as-admin&quot; automatically at login.&quot;<br />
<br />
Are you refering to apps launched via a shortcut added to $SMSTARTUP ?? when windows bootsup? <br />
<br />
This is looking promising so far..<br />

I experimented with this and it seems like if exe is set to run as admin, shortcuts automatically inherit it. I started off working on shortcuts, but it seems like doing exe is enough<br />

My NSIS script does this:<br />
<br />
 <br />
!insertmacro WriteRegStringIfUndef HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run&quot; \<br />
 &quot;openvpn-gui&quot;  &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\openvpn-gui.exe&quot;<br />
    WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\layers&quot; \<br />
 &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\openvpn-gui.exe&quot; &quot;RUNASADMIN&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Which under XP start openvpn-gui when user logs in. Under Vista after reboot I get a message in system tray - &quot;Windows has blocked some startup programs&quot;. I tried putting the shortcut in the startup folder - same thing. Looks like you cannot run &quot;run as admin&quot; programs automatically on login - which sucks.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
I am still relatively new to NSIS, so I am not sure I understand how to use plugins.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the ShellLink Plug In from: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellLink_plug-in<br />
<br />
I unzipped it and copied the ShellLink.dll file to Program Files\NSIS\Plugins.<br />
<br />
Trying to follow the example on the plugin page, I then modified a part of my script from:<br />
<br />
...<br />
CreateDirectory &quot;$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}&quot;<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCT_NAME}.exe&quot;<br />
...<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
...<br />
CreateDirectory &quot;$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}&quot;<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCT_NAME}.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
ShellLink::SetRunAsAdministrator &quot;$STARTMENU\Programs\${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER}\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk&quot;<br />
Pop $0<br />
 <br />
$0=0   -no errors<br />
$0=-1  -error<br />
...<br />
<br />
That causes the following error when I try to compile my script:<br />
<br />
<br />
Plugin Command: SetRunAsAdministrator $STARTMENU\Programs\Sharp Software\Auto Sales Manager WPF Server.lnk<br />
Pop: $0<br />
Invalid command: $0=0<br />
Error in script &quot;C:\Sharp Software\Auto Sales Manager\trunk\build\scripts\Auto Sales Manager WPF Server.nsi&quot; on line 82 -- aborting creation process<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help getting this to work would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Normally I'd say 'add a manifest', but I have no idea if that works for file associations. I think you can put &quot;runas.exe /user:Administrator yourexe.exe %1&quot; (or something similar) as the opening application, and it will throw a window asking for the admin password. But it's probably much better to make your exe take care of this problem itself: make it so it launches another instance of itself as admin, if it's being run as user.</div></div><hr />
