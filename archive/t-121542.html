<br />
It's been quite a while and there still are very few users. So, here I am promoting the IRC channel again because the FAQ entry didn't seem to do the trick.<br />
<br />
The IRC channel is #nsis @ irc.landoleet.org (irc://irc.landoleet.org/nsis).<br />
<br />
For those of you who have no idea what I am talking about, IRC is an abbreviation for Internet Relay Chat. It's a protocol for chatting online.<br />
<br />
To get in IRC go download an IRC client such as mIRC (http://www.mirc.com/). According to the client's documentation join the server irc.landoleet.org, and then the #nsis channel. If you are using mIRC, or any other client that supports irc:// URLs, you can just click the link above (#nsis @ irc.landoleet.org (irc://irc.landoleet.org/nsis)).<br />
<br />
SuperPimp and JoeTheBot are robots staying in the IRC channel. SuperPimp can give you information about users. Use !seen and !seennick with a user nick name to find out when SuperPimp last seen that user, use !lastspoke with a user nick name to find out when SuperPimp last heard that user, use !seenstats to find out how many users SuperPimp knows.<br />
<br />
Other possible IRC clients savIRC (http://www.savirc.com/) - An open source IRC client packaged with NSIS.<br />
 HydraIRC (http://hydrairc.sourceforge.net/) - An open source IRC client packaged with NSIS.<br />
 BitchX (http://www.bitchx.org/) - An open source IRC client that is very widespread on *nix.<br />
 Xirc (http://xirc.donkax.com/) - Another free IRC client packaged with NSIS.</div></div><hr />
