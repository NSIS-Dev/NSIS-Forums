<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">30th January 2012, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">it sounds like you want to prevent all input on the machine whilst this is going on and that is really not a solution and from a user view point is as bad as what viruses / hacking will do. and if the machine this is intended to be run on is hacked then you're fighting things from the wrong side.<br />
<br />
if it's really that much of a thing for you, you'd be better off finding a way to run the installer so it cannot be terminated (like how some services can). though why you're wanting to backup NOD32's update files is beyond me (and sounds rather hackerish on it's own merit).<br />
