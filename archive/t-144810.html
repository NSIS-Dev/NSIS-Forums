<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bidger</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks.  I'm using the UpgradeDLL (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=38) macro to upgrade DLLs in <br />
&quot;$PROGRAMFILES\${COMPANY_NAME}\Shared\${PRODUCT_NAME}&quot; <br />
<br />
When the DLL needs to be upgraded, but is in use, this macro cunningly extracts the file to a temporary location and copies it over the actual location at reboot.  In order to reregister the DLL, the macro also adds the following entry to the RunOnce registry key.<br />
<br />
&quot;C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\rundll32.exe&quot; &quot;C:\Program Files\Company\Shared\Product\TheDll.dll&quot;,DllRegisterServer<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this does not work for me.  This is because TheDll.dll has a static dependency (that I cannot change) on AnotherDll.dll that also resides in &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\${COMPANY_NAME}\Shared\${PRODUCT_NAME}&quot;.  Due to the way rundll32.exe uses LoadLibrary{1}, it does not search my installation directory for dependencies, and so fails to load TheDll.dll.  This means TheDll.dll does not get reregistered and so the whole system doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I have several choices[list=1]<br />
 Bundle an appropriate version of regsvr32 with the installer and use this to do the RunOnce stuff instead of rundll32.<br />
 Stick with rundll32 and temporarily add my installation directory to the system path (will this then be used at the time RunOnce keys are executed?)<br />
 Find another, better, way to make the rundll32 trick work<br />
[/list=1]<br />
Can anyone suggest a solution that works for Windows 9x onwards?<br />
<br />
TIA - bidger<br />

{1} See the MSDN info (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/loadlibraryex.asp) on LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH and &quot;the alternate file search strategy&quot; that rundll32, unfortunately, does not use.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bidger</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion kichik but I think I've found a solution.  Writing '&quot;$SYSDIR\regsvr32.exe&quot; /s &quot;C:\Program Files\Company\Shared\Product\TheDll.dll&quot;' to the RunOnce key seems to work fine.  I had read somewhere that there can be problems with using regsvr32 like this - maybe one of the reasons NSIS has its own RegDll command?  Is this method always going to work?  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 11:36</div></div><div class="posttext">RegSvr32 is not present on all versions of Windows 95, that's why we don't use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bidger</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I see... Judging by MSDN KB239873 (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/q249/8/73.asp&amp;NoWebContent=1), regsvr32.exe should be available on all Windows 95 systems that we target.  Therefore I think we've got a solution.  Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, it is not available on the first edition of Windows 95. There is another page where you can download regsvr32.</div></div><hr />
