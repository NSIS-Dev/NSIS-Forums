<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brainz</div><div class="date">12th June 2001, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick query, that I can't see in the documentation.<br />
<br />
It is to do with installers built with installation options, for example the example2.nsi in the distribution.<br />
<br />
When this installer is running, the first step that a user completes is to make a selection, in this case whether to select Start Menu Shortcuts or not.<br />
<br />
The user then selects next and is taken to the Installation Directory screen.<br />
<br />
If at this point he wishes to change his selection, he clicks back.<br />
<br />
But when the first screen, entitled Installation Options shows, the Start Menu Shortcusts shows as selected again.<br />
<br />
The installer appears to have forgotten what had been chosen.<br />
<br />
Is there any way of making it remember ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">12th June 2001, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Not with the current code, but I don't personally consider that a &quot;dumb&quot; question.  It should be, at the very least, up to the developer whether or not the options go back to default.  I hereby request a new &quot;feature&quot; for NSIS (Edgewise and Justin take note :) )...<br />
<br />
OptionsReset ON|OFF <br />
<br />
<br />
OptionsReset ON will make the options jump back to the developer configured defaults if the user selects back.<br />
<br />
OptionsReset OFF will let the user-selected options stay if the user backs up to check what they did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgewize</div><div class="date">12th June 2001, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm.  It really ought to remember user settings by default.  I'll see what I can do about that.<br />
<br />
If the user enters a change and hits the Next button, I can't imagine why it should ever reset to the developer's settings.  I don't think that such an option is necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd just like to say that effort on this installer is fantastic.<br />
<br />
I downloaded nsis143.exe to build an installer for use in our company, finished it in 2 hrs, and started the documentation for it in the pm.<br />
<br />
When I checked out the web site to ensure the URLs were right in the afternoon, a new version had appeared ...<br />
<br />
I suppose I prefixed the question with newbie as I'd got less than 8hrs experience with it, and thought it was a silly question.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your input, hard work and help.<br />
<br />
regards<br />
<br />
tim</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kudos to Justin for creating such a wonderful installer and open-sourcing the code :)</div></div><hr />
