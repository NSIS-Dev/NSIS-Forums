<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kidboy</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 04:12</div></div><div class="posttext">So here's a quick question.  I want to build custom installers on the fly via my website.  I have done some simliar things by using apache and catching the data produced on stdout and sending it to user.  So my question is can I make nsis produce the installer on stdout instead of writing it to a file.  Do I have to modify the source to make this happen.<br />

That way you won't be reading the output to the user if it fails, you can handle that case differently. Also makensis outputs a lot of information to stdout which you'd want in case of an error. I think you should be redirecting stdout to an error.log and then if it doesn't look like there was an error you would send the generated file to the user. The error.log will tell you the name of the file makensis created.</div></div><hr />

If you still want to output to stdout you will have to change the source (start with build.cpp - int CEXEBuild::write_output(void)).</div></div><hr />
