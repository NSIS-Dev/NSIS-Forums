<br />
Firstly, id like to clarify that im no advanced NSIS user, i have only done simple jobs in the past based on tutorials.<br />
<br />
The installer im making requires the launching of a program to extract a file archive (which can only be done with a specific tool), and then copying files over to replace extracted files, then running another tool to repackage them.<br />
<br />
To do this, itd require launching the tool, waiting it for it to close (since after extraction it closes), copying over files, launching repackaging tool then continue with the final installation process.<br />
<br />
ExecShell'ing the tools and copying over the files are pretty straightforward, its detecting when a window closes which im having trouble with.  I would assume that i would have to put FindWindow on a loop till the window is not detected, then continue with the script.  I am not sure if this is the most efficient way or how to go about this properly.  Any help would be appreciated :)<br />
<br />
edit: i forgot to mention the most relevant topics i could find were the following: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Detect_if_a_window_is_open_and_close_it.<br />
