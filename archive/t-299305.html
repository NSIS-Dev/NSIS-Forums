<br />
I am new to NSIS and - as is often the case - need to get to understand it adequately by yesterday.  With the help of the documentation and by stuyding scripts generated by apps such as HM NIS Edit I have understood nearly everything I currently require.  However, there is one thing I still have not been able to figure out<br />
<br />
- I would like to generate the one install.exe (or whatever) both for new installations and for upgrades.  In the former case I want to allow the user to be able to select the install directory while in the latter case I want the upgrade to go silently into the current install location.  I cannot see how this can be done.  True, I can manually change InstDir and use the .onVerifyInstDir callback but the former is bound to be confusing and the latter is far from elegant.<br />
<br />
And yet, given the clear power of NSIS I am sure this can be done.  I would be most grateful for any pointers.</div></div><hr />
