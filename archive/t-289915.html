<br />
When trying to uninstall, it gives me an error suggesting that it has previously been uninstalled, and that would I like to remove it from the add/remove programs list? Well.. I looked in the INSTDIR and there wasn't a uninst.exe file. Is that why it has given me such a message? And does anyone know why the uninst.exe isn't there? In my older script, the uninstaller worked perfectly, and the only things I have thought to change were the files that were installed. <br />
I haven't yet amended the delete list, with all the correct file names, but that shouldn't affect whether the uninst.exe is created or not right?</div></div><hr />

Edit1: Main reason I'm not putting in code tags, is because the forum layout gets screwed up on my end :/ hope it's ok!<br />
<br />
Edit1: Actually, I have a loose theory, that this could be connected to the style of my custom page functions..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">9th April 2008, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're uninstaller is set to allow for deletion of files on reboot for those files that couldn't be removed at uninstall time, this could be your culprit.  I had an old issue where my uninstaller failed to remove uninst.exe and marked it to remove on reboot.  However, I wasn't enforcing this reboot from my installer so that a user could then re-install the build, reboot the system, and voila, the uninstaller was gone!</div></div><hr />
