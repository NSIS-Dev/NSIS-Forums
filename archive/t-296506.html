<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blockcipher</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know why System::Alloc would not allocate memory?  I'm trying to allocate a small amount of memory, but for some reason it won't in the script I wrote.  I tried the System.nsi sample script and it worked fine!  As far as I can tell, I'm not really doing anything different, however I keep getting 0 back as the result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Possible reasons are: The system is out of memory or the remaining memory is too much fragmented (that is: there is no continuous block of free memory of the requested size). Both sounds very unlikely in your case, because you say that you are requesting only a &quot;small amount&quot; of memory. So I guess you are doing something wrong. But it's hard to say without seeing your code...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blockcipher</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, yeah, that would help if I could post it.  It's for a project at work, so I can't do that.<br />
<br />
As for running out of memory, yeah, that's not happening.  I tried this on a machine with 13Gb free and I'm only trying to allocate 4 bytes, which is the size of the value I'm trying to put into the buffer.<br />
<br />
I do figure I'm doing something wrong, however I can't for the life of me figure it out.  Every example I found revealed nothing of use.  I mainly posted to see if anyone know of any sort of stack size limit/heap size limit/config setting/other that may have an affect on whether or not memory can be allocated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I tried this, just like the example:<br />
<br />
OutFile &quot;TestAlloc.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Section<br />
  System::Alloc 4<br />
  Pop $0<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;4 bytes allocated at $0&quot;<br />
  System::Free $0<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
And the result seems to work fine:<br />
<br />
4 bytes allocated at 2247232<br />
Completed<br />
<br />
Something else must go wrong in your installer...</div></div><hr />
