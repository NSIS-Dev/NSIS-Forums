<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jai123</div><div class="date">12th August 2011, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a whole set of sections and subsections in my components page. For example,<br />
<br />
- SectionGroup: CNCRouter<br />
--- Section Subgroup: Vision<br />
--- ........<br />
--- ........<br />
- SectionGroup: Other kind of Router<br />
- SectionGroup: .......<br />
- ........<br />
- SectionGroup: Drivers and Utilities<br />
--- Section Subgroup: Router Driver<br />
--- Section Subgroup: Vision Driver<br />
<br />
Depending on the selection I choose, some other section/subsection will be selected, other will be deselected, and other ignored. For example, if I choose CNCRouter, it will choose CNC Router Driver and Vision Driver. How can I know which one was the last checkbox chosen?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jaime</div></div><hr />

But you can do it by setting some variables in .onSelChange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jai123</div><div class="date">16th August 2011, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my installer has several products from which the user can choose from, and I want to limit the user to only install one product every time that the installer is run.<br />
<br />
Knowing the last checked checkbox, it will allow me to make sure that all other sections and subsections are deselected.<br />
<br />
MSG, .onSelChange is what I was looking for. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
