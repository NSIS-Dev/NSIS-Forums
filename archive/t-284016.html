<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jacilore</div><div class="date">30th December 2007, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all:<br />
<br />
I am new to this forum and have got involved to make an installer with NSIS for a VBasic application I have already made. The question is that when the installer is already executing, when it's about to finish, I get the error in the attachment, but I found no way to debug after the compilation of the installer is made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea of how can I track the execution of the installer to know what is the cause for the type of problem I have encountered?.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
(Sorry for the text in Spanish, I can translate anything you need, of course. For the moment I don't tell you what the installer does, as it could be enough if the debugger helps. Otherwise I would post again with more details to be helped.)<br />
<br />
Edited: I have attached a jpg file with less than 200 KB. that haven't appeared. (Any clue of how to post it?).<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why but after I attach the file it doesn't appear in the Reply window.<br />
<br />
I am going to try from another computer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jacilore</div><div class="date">30th December 2007, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, thanks. it just says an error signature, which is the following:<br />
<br />
AppName: my installer.exe	 AppVer: 0.0.0.0	 ModName: ntdll.dll<br />
ModVer: 5.1.2600.2180	 Offset: 00001010<br />
<br />
<br />
and then it creates a file error in order to be sent to Microsoft:<br />
<br />
I attach it in 2 parts, for size reasons, (it says a lot of things that I don't think are related), but here it goes anyway:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th December 2007, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like some DLL you're registering is causing the crash. Try narrowing down the search by removing everything else but RegDLL and plug-in calls. Using a debugger would make this task easier as it'd give you a stack trace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jacilore</div><div class="date">30th December 2007, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the other part:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jacilore</div><div class="date">30th December 2007, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, kichik, thanks very much for your help. I am not very familiar with dll's and plug-ins, but I will do my best if necessary<br />
<br />
Anyway, could you tell me which debugger could I use for to track the installer step by step?<br />
<br />
(For your information, I have got involved in creating this installer without knowing much about NSIS, and actually, I have nearly got it work by adding a couple of functions collected in internet to a basic installer created by the HM NIS assistant.<br />
<br />
The function that is causing the problem is one that finds the path to search a certain file, and it does get it, but then the installer collapses.<br />
<br />
So I am nearly at the end of the job, but it seems to understand quite well the problem could make me learn a lot of things from zero, and I am not familiar with all this.<br />
<br />
That's why I am choosing to try to deduce from a debugger where the error could lay, learn about the specific problem, and then give more details if someone were willing<br />
to get deeper in my problem.)<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
