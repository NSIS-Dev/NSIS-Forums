<br />
I'm new to NSIS, so this may be a basic problem, but any help or advice would be much appreciated.  In short I'm developing for a non-profit group a software add-on that would (using NSIS) install itself into the program directory of previously loaded commercial software for some satellite communication stuff.  Basically the commercial software installs to c:\Program Files\Company Name\RANDOM\Content.  The &quot;RANDOM&quot; folder is a name that isn't quite random, nonetheless it has significant variation based upon the installation version of the software -- my add-on needs to work on all versions.  This name, depending upon the version, can be quite different (ie: it's not as simple as version1, version2, etc.).  Normally, I'd have NSIS just look in the registry for the path name to have my add-on placed in the same directory, unfortunately the commercial software doesn't seem to create a registry item, for whatever reason, when installed.  Is there a way, using wildcards, or a list of all possible names for the &quot;RANDOM&quot; folder, to have NSIS discover what that dang folder is actually called?  This would then be part of the correct install directory.<br />
<br />
Once again thanks in advance for any help.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Enlil</div></div><hr />
