<br />
I'm using NSIS for the first time and I've two problems, Can somebody help me please?.    <br />
    <br />
1 my application, developed in Visual Basic 6.0, uses the controls activex Real Player and Windows Media, both in version 9.0; with Real Player it seems not to have any problem but when the user tries to execute the program, after a clean installation (without error messages) the application doesn't works if the version of Windows Media installed in the computer is different to the version 9.0.    <br />
    <br />
2. The program uses ACCESS databases therefore I've to include the database controller ADO by Microsoft, but I don't know how to locate it in the directory &quot;c:\program files\Microsoft shared...etc&quot; using NSIS, I could make it directly writing the full path  but this would only work with Windows English versions and the app uses 6 languages.    <br />
    <br />
Does somebody know the form of solving these problems?, <br />
    <br />
Thank you for your cooperation</div></div><hr />
