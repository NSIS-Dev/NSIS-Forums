<br />
for the unistall components i was using a page created with Install Options plugin. now i'm <br />
<br />
trying to change it with the new uninstall page component.<br />
let's say i have 3 uninstall sections. i uninstall only the 1st one. the next time i launch the <br />
<br />
uninstall i still can select that section !?.<br />
if i uninstalled it, i should not be able to uninstall it &quot;again&quot;. no? (this is my question)<br />
<br />
am i doing something the wrong way, it's a bug or what?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />
i hope that you understand what i'm trying to ask.</div></div><hr />

You can make the uninstall repair too and have the user select which components to repair. In this case, the component shouldn't be removed after the &quot;uninstaller&quot; finished.<br />
<br />
As always with NSIS, you have total control, minimal limiting assumptions are made.</div></div><hr />

You can hide it (set its name to &quot;&quot;) if a file doesn't exist, a registry key doesn't exist, a file doesn't contain a certain certain or anything else.</div></div><hr />
