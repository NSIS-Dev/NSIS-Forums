<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blinker</div><div class="date">16th March 2010, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there.<br />
<br />
I have a few questions regarding installation rules/assumptions with Windows XP/Vista/7. We have a software application that's used in the corporate world.<br />
<br />
Our software is 10+ years old - and unfortunately, it still breaks some of the rules - this is becoming more of a problem in a corporate environment.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
1) Our product defaults to install in the ROOT directory. ie: C:\OurProduct - easily fixed.<br />
<br />
2) We store application configuration data inside C:\OurProduct. These are application settings - not user settings.<br />
<br />
3) Database files for our product are stored in C:\OurProduct\Data<br />
<br />
I recently did away with our old installer, and upgraded to NSIS (which I love - thanks for all your hard work). But I'd like to do-away with some of our past-sins and get this installing the way most-applications do with Windows.<br />
<br />
Do you know of a resource that gives the &quot;guidelines&quot; or rules for installers?<br />
<br />
What do you recommend for #2 and #3 above? We'd prefer not to use the registry for #2, and would like to NOT have these data files/settings associated with the user, but the PC. Is there such a folder?<br />
<br />
Any tips would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />
M.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Use $PROGRAMFILES, $PROGRAMFILES32, or $PROGRAMFILES64<br />
<br />
2) Use $APPDATA<br />
<br />
3) I would either use APPDATA or store the database stuff relative to the install ($INSTDIR)</div></div><hr />

Is there a writable path that all users have access to, similar to this?</div></div><hr />

SetShellVarContext all</div></div><hr />
