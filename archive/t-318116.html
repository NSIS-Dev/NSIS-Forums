<br />
I am using the third party software's in my application.   I need to set the path for the third party software through N SIS. In which path my application is installed, that path i need to set for the third party software. If anybody knows kindly let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">2nd April 2010, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this depends entirely on the installer used for that third party software, don't you agree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thirunamca06</div><div class="date">2nd April 2010, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for your reply<br />
<br />
I agree that, but i am new to N SIS. I didn't have much knowledge about the N SIS. It may be possible, if some one can implemented then i can use that. So only i posted here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">2nd April 2010, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the point is that it's impossible to answer your question without knowing what kind of third party software we're talking about. It's not like there's a magic, generally applicable method to make random installer software do an automatic install to some specified directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">2nd April 2010, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on how and where that third party software would be expecting the path to your application.<br />
<br />
For example it might use the registry (see: WriteRegStr), or it might use an INI file (see: WriteIniStr), or... etc.  If you know what it uses to figure out where your application is, then going forward is a lot easier ;)</div></div><hr />

I want to install the Mingw through my application. User want's to click the next button, my application path wants to set for the Mingw. I need to do this mingw installation as silent installation with out user interference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd April 2010, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Well according to notes on AppDeploy, MingW uses NSIS. However, their installer has not been written properly and /S will not work (it appears to download files normally but they've probably done this in page callbacks - oops!) However the notes on AppDeploy are from 2008 so things may have changed since. Try running the installer with /S and see how it goes. If that works, you can use the /D switch as well (see NSIS manual for installer command line options) and you can use ExecWait.<br />
