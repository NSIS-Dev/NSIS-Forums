<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MindlessOath</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 01:00</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i used nsis in the past, but im trying to do something i have never done before.<br />
<br />
im looking to make an installer choose items in a certain way.<br />
<br />
the User has to choose to install some options and other applications. the options are as follows...<br />
<br />
Writes:<br />
<br />
writes on<br />
writes off<br />
 <br />
the user must choose one or the other default option would be OFF!<br />
and then annother set of options<br />
<br />
Mods:<br />
<br />
Normal<br />
model#1<br />
model#2<br />
<br />
the user must choose one of them, the default option would be normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
then the applications are as follows<br />
<br />
application1<br />
application2<br />
application3<br />
<br />
application1 and application2 can enable and dissable, they dont need to be checked, but if they are, i want those files to be extracted when choosen.<br />
application3 will be the default application, so it will be grayed out and will automaticly be extracted, but i want it in the list so the user knows the size of file being installed is.<br />
<br />
each application will have a description and a size.<br />
application1 will be 3mb, application2 will be 100kb, and application3 will be 60mb<br />
<br />
i want to try this with the modren gui.. but im unsure what the best way to go about this, let alone how to go about it.<br />
<br />
i have read alot of documentation but cant find what im looking for (likly im just blind or i dont comprehend how its type).<br />
<br />
anyone up for helping :) thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">michaelcsikos</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 07:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a look at the one-section.nsi example in the NSIS\Examples folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MindlessOath</div><div class="date">23rd June 2007, 00:30</div></div><div class="posttext">see, thats the problem, i read that but it doesnt do what i want.<br />
<br />
i have 3 GROUPS and in each GROUP i want something differnt done.<br />
<br />
GROUP0 is manditory so its not really an issue.<br />
<br />
GROUP1<br />
choose<br />
Selection1 <br />
OR<br />
Selection2<br />
<br />
GROUP2<br />
choose<br />
Selection1 <br />
OR<br />
Selection2<br />
OR<br />
Selection3<br />
BUT only ONE of the three!<br />
<br />
GROUP3<br />
choose either Selection1 or Selection2<br />
Both can be selected or NOT selected, or one selected and not the other, it doesnt matter - its whatever the eu wants in group3.<br />
<br />
<br />
In all the examples it doesnt tell me how to do this. and when i do try and do this it messes things up and it selects multiple options and i dont want that (in group2 at least it does).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MindlessOath</div><div class="date">23rd June 2007, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, the problem is this... they are in groups ie &quot;sectionGroup&quot; and that will have negitave effect on what i want.<br />
<br />
i need to make each section seperate so the end user knows that there are three selections ie<br />
-write<br />
-Mod<br />
-app<br />
<br />
if i use sectiongroup then this causes the problem im having where it will select multiple choices when i dont want it to in the first two catigories (its perfect for the third catigory).<br />
<br />
how would i make the first two catigories (sectiongroups) without the sectiongroup feature of selecting multiple options?  i want it to be a section that expands but not to select multiple options at once, just one option at a time.<br />
<br />
So im looking for a way to make it look like 3 differnt catigories, but without using the attributes of sectiongroup cmd. i tried to use SubSection also, but that does the same thing as sectiongroup essentially.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">23rd June 2007, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I see now sorry. The only way to prevent this is to detect when the section group check state has changed (in .onSelChange) and then either check one of the sections or uncheck all.<br />
<br />
I can have a go at this if I have time tonight, otherwise it might have to be tomorrow (it's Saturday night after all!)<br />

<br />
much appreciation!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a go at this today but it isn't possible. NSIS checks the child nodes after the .onSelChange function so setting their check state there is pointless. All I can suggest is that you post a feature request to disable parent check features and allow for parent node check boxes to be hidden or disabled, or you use the EmbeddedLists plug-in (http://nsis.sf.net/EmbeddedLists_plug-in) which has these features (although today I'm going to add a NoCheckBox attribute to hide check boxes.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have updated EmbeddedLists to support DisableCheck=3. This hides a check box completely when the check bitmap is being used.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">29th June 2007, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a hard time following this thread, so I hope I got it right that you're looking for a solution to the dreaded section group click while using the RadioButton macro. All you need to do is check if the section group is selected and unselect it. See the following thread for an example:<br />

<br />
BTW, by reading the first post in this thread, I'd say you're better off with a custom page with real radio buttons that'd better explain the user what exactly he has to select.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">3rd July 2007, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Should have guessed that considering that's how EmbeddedLists disables check boxes (when not using a check bitmap).<br />
