<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">9th October 2001, 06:08</div></div><div class="posttext">G'day to All NSISers,<br />
<br />
For a while now, I have been working on the NSIS Project House on SourceForge.net ( http://nsisphouse.sourceforge.net , http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/nsisphouse ) and I have finally been able to create the PHP and is (almost) ready for upload! If you wish to contribute to the project (like providing your own versions of NSIS or NSIS GUIs and the like), then upload the following to a webserver:<br />
<br />
<br />
 A binary of their project w/out source code in a .exe<br />
 The source in a .zip format<br />
 Their actual distributed product (Whatever you want to have) in a .exe<br />
<br />
<br />
and provide the links here.<br />
<br />
For those of you who want to track the stats yourself from your webserver, I will have a php page in place so that you may add to the project, but it will still be added later.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
-Duane</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have an NSIS hack, add the necessary source file(s) with the hack commented (with what is does) in a .zip file.<br />
<br />
If you have a SourceForge Account, (in this forum) tell me your Unix (login) name and I will add you as some type of admin.<br />

<br />
cya,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">10th October 2001, 03:56</div></div><div class="posttext">all i see is a broken zip file ;) when will there be something up? if you have any PHP questions you can drop them here i will be happy to guide you :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">10th October 2001, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the broken .zip file was from bad advice from SourceForge. But I have been working on the PHP stuff. I am almost finished with the front page, and now I need to work on the MySQL databasing. I wanted to host my own forum, but it will not be able to do that. But if I need your help, I will PM you (you know, the last thing at the bottom of the forums' front page).  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, they just added MySQL databasing. I am going to use it for the projects and the information about it. I just got a PHP/MySQL book and I am working to create it. I did make a PHP listing that will be uploaded this evening, once I debug it. It will NOT write to MySQL, but I will have some type of thing so you can submit the URLs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 06:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have completed a final version of the Temp site, but I don't have the programs that upload to SourceForge on this computer, but I will have it done.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th October 2001, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, sorry about this, but I have some good news and some bad news.<br />
<br />
Bad News: It will be a little longer for you to see the actual site AND the temp site will NOT be uploaded.<br />
<br />
Good News: I have gotten most of the MySQL down so much so that now all I have to worry about is the PHP Scripting and I know much of that too. We also have some mailing lists. The first one is for the developers in here. Goto https://lists.sorceforge.net/lists/listinfo/nsisphouse-devl to sign-up.<br />
<br />
I must no go and code like hell. I have been pumping some Mountain Dew: Code Red and some Eve6 into my system. I will have this finished.<br />
<br />
I need an image creator. I want some one to create a logo that kinda looks like the PHP | http://www.php.net | logo but a little different. If you can create something like that for me, then e-mail it to me in a .zip file format to duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">one question : is this the official hp for nsis in the future ?<br />
<br />
or will nsis get a page at nullsoft (better than the current one)<br />
<br />
i have some changes made in the code (german language) i've heard about that nsis will support different languages in the future versions and would like to see it and maybe to rewrite some stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I am in no way affiliated with nullsoft/AOLTW. I am doing this for everyone who wants to have a central location for NSIS related items. The Best part is anyone can join. So, if you want to add your project to NSISPH, then you can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">'(better than the current one)'<br />
<br />
what on earth! the nsis page is great, it is all info and no fluff, loads fast and i dont think you could say a single thing against its effectiveness...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">:p <br />
<br />
yo man great nsis site ! pure text not these ugly thins like <br />
graphics that will only produce traffic (juhu)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">the way i look at it is that we arent trying to sell this program to everyone for christmas.. anyone coming to this page is looking for an installation utility and that is exactly what they will find 100% bullshit free...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 04:04</div></div><div class="posttext">After some initial testing ... and ... IT'S ALIVE (not yet, but soon). I now have to work out the MySQL Databasing (In the initial test, I used 4 different databases, SourceForge only allows 1), but it is much more likely that it will be complete. I still need a graphic logo for the project, but I will probably create one tommorow in class, but who knows. I have been looking at this thing called PHP Nuke for some hacks that tell someone who is on and who is just visiting. I have been considering putting the source on SourceForge and that means you can use it to base your sites of off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 04:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Update ... Update ... Update<br />
<br />
I will be implementing new sections. I want to have the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
 New NSIS Languages<br />
 NSIS Gooeys<br />
 Foriegn Languages<br />
 NSIS Source Hacks<br />
 General NSIS Hacks<br />
<br />
<br />
If there are any sections you want me to place into the site, Tell me now before I Upload the site. <br />
<br />
Developers: Once you sign-up for the service, you will have the ability to post news about your program. If there is a new program added to the project, then an automatic posting will be placed. I will have some rules in place, but since we are all developers here, I will have very small rules in place. But since this is an continuing project, I will need your help and advice until the initial launch date. Check my Sig for date updates.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deep-Trouble</div><div class="date">29th October 2001, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">HI All,<br />
   I have added up the BrandImage version of NSIS to the NSISPHouse at sourceforge.  Duane when is the website coming up..?  Atleast put up the alpha version of it so we too can test it :)<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Deepak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">29th October 2001, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have some screen shots later. What I really want is something that looks like a the NSDN site, but spanning the whole window and not have a master table. This will take some time however, as I got a virus (mom's fault not mine, I wish I had made a backup on my laptop) and I have to &quot;respawn&quot; the fragmented data packets (I wish I had UNIX). But it will take some time. I am restarting the coding and I will have something done soon. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience. <br />
<br />
I still need a Logo and no one will help me!!!!  :) <br />

<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
