<br />
In my uninstall process, I restart HotSync.exe. If I use 'Add/Remove Programs' to do the uninstall, the uninstall freezes at the end until I exit out of HotSync.exe.  Then it finishes normally.<br />
<br />
I have tried everything I can think of.  It doesn't matter how I restart HotSync.exe, if it is still running when the uninstaller finishes, I'm hosed.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? This doesn't happen with InstallShield.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Try the others Exec's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scottmax</div><div class="date">12th August 2003, 01:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Not using ExecWait.  The normal way to do it is to just call `HsSetAppStatus(HsRestart,0);'. This is a Palm call to restart HotSync.exe. If you run the uninstaller outside of Add/Remove, it does appear to finish and removes itself from the task list.  'Add/Remove Programs' just gets stuck when it is done.<br />
<br />
I have also tried exec and CreateProcess.  In CreateProcess, I tell it to be a separate process.  Same results no matter what I try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andrew Francis</div><div class="date">12th August 2003, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had similar problems with Hotsync when removing a conduit. I suspect it has something to do with with the Add/Remove Programs monitoring of the files under the directory you're uninstalling from (however it does that size estimate), perhaps because typically you're removing your conduit DLL and/or program-specific copies of the Palm DLLs.<br />
<br />
(EDIT: I remove the conduit by calling out to Palm's PCI.exe rather than using a plugin, so I'm fairly confident it's not my fault.)<br />
<br />
I never found a solution, and had to resort to the brute force method: before uninstallation just kill Hotsync altogether (FindWindow &quot;KittyHawk&quot; &quot;Hotsync Manager&quot;, then SendMessage hwd 48837 1 0), and afterwards tell the user they'll have to restart Hotsync Manager themselves, or restart their computer :/</div></div><hr />
