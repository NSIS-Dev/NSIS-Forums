<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr Inches</div><div class="date">12th September 2006, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The next version of CABSetup will have the functions required to update the space required figures with the size of the data set.<br />
<br />
I did this as part of developing the progressbar for CABSetup (which will also be in the next release). Don't forget that CABSetup cannot handle a dataset size greater than 4GB, so your 7GB will have to be split into two datasets. <br />
<br />
The space requirements and progress bar are tied to the dataset size so this will mean a bit of arithmetic will be needed. More details will be in the updated documentation.<br />
<br />
Re the error occurring but success being reported, remember CABSetup functions return the error code on the NSIS stack, any non-zero value means something went wrong (the documentation provides more information). You have to pop the error off the stack and handle it yourself - CABSetup only provides the information.<br />
<br />
NSIS will report &quot;Completed&quot; once any script completes unless your installer sets &quot;DetailsPrint None&quot; before the script completes.<br />
<br />
I expect to provide the next release within the next few days and will provide a message to the forum when I do so.<br />
