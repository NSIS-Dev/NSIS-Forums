In another reply from KiCHiK (I can't find it anymore), he said that he would possibly try eventually to create a new version of BgImage with those capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">VirtLink, you seem a bit confused... It's your post that is double. The other thread is maybe about BgImage too but is not the same question. True, he could have included it in this one but he chose not to and that's up to him. I see nothing wrong with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Then I'm sorry. I tought it was the same question, so I posted the answer also twice. And then I got the message that I can't post more than one message every 60 seconds :weird:.</div></div><hr />
