<br />
I am new to NSIS and was pointed to the software by one of the creators of 7-ZIP. I don't have the time at the current moment to learn how to script the installer to do exactly what I want (however I do want to learn the method as soon as I have time). <br />
<br />
Basically what I need to do is take a ZIP file and have the installer automatically install the files to the appropriate location. I can do this using some of the additions to NSIS but the issue lies in the fact that I want to FIX the install location. The install location will always be &quot;C:\&quot;. After the files are &quot;installed&quot; to that location I need to enter some information from a .REG file into the registry; I would like the installer to open/run the .REG file and place the information into the registry (either a .REG or a .BAT file eventually).<br />
<br />
Any help would be great. A simple example of the files needed to do what I am looking for would be great!!! Thank you in advance. :D <br />
<br />
This installer is for some deployment files for my job and I need to get them out asap.</div></div><hr />

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Category:Plugins<br />
however extracting the zip locally and adding the files in your installer with File command offers a better handling of the installation.<br />
<br />
Installing in a root directory e.g. C:\ requires the AllowRootDirInstall,<br />

<br />
The execution of the reg or bat file is possible with Exec ExecWait or ExecShell,<br />
