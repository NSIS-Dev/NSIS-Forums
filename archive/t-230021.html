<br />
I have several times included an attachment when initiating a topic or replying to an existing one. My experience has been that if I do a Preview, then the attachment is lost ... or at least the input field to specify the attachment is blank.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong? Is this something that the nsis forum administrator could check into, or that is perhaps a flaw in the underlying forum software?<br />
<br />
BTW ... just checked this with this post ... attached a file and then did a Preview. Wonder if the attachment shows up?? <br />
<br />
drum roll please .... and the answer is .... doesn't seem to be an attachment<br />
<br />
&lt;/alert&gt;</div></div><hr />
