<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JWood</div><div class="date">4th April 2005, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still trying to understand an installation error two of about 17 testers are seeing during installation. Both testers were apparently running setup from their power user account, running setup as the administrator on Windows 2000.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library<br />
<br />
Runtime Error!<br />
<br />
Program: C:\Program Files\Cygnus\Cygnus.exe<br />
<br />
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information.<br />
<br />
[OK]<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Cygnus.exe is my application and it is written in Visual C++. It's not clear to me if that's the program that is failing. I don't user abort() to handle errors and I don't understand why my application would be running during the installation. My application does not need to be registered. Is it being registered anyway?<br />
<br />
I've got a pretty standard script (attached) created by the HM NIS Editor and Wizards. My setup includes several DLLs renamed with extensions such as CYX and CYT. None of the DLLs require registration either.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips!</div></div><hr />
