Is there a way to check if these are installed when running an NSIS installer?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QOAL</div><div class="date">9th September 2008, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't you ask the people that made the software you're checking for what and where the reg keys are for their software. (Or even just poke about in the registry for them yourself)<br />
Checking for a key that points to the software's uninstaller would probably be best, since it's very likely the app is still installed then. (like HKLM Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\$APP &quot;UninstallString&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">9th September 2008, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">On a related note, there is a freeware gem called Installation Analyzer (http://www.lionbridge.com/lionbridge/en-US/services/outsourced-testing/product-certification-programs/microsoft/Certified-for-Windows/cfw_analyzer.htm) that can take a before and after snapshot of the system to list all file and registry changes that happened during an installation.  It's quite useful in determining what changed during an install and might give you a list of things to check to determine whether those 3rd part apps were actually installed.<br />
<br />
However, to be 100% certain you are checking the right thing, it's probably best to go to the source as suggested by QOAL.</div></div><hr />
