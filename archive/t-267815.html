<br />
I am a part of a developing team that is currently developing a product for a commercial release.<br />
<br />
I would very much like to use NSIS as the installation system for this product.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about something though and would like to verify this:<br />
I'm using the Modern UI interface for the setup system and I noticed that theres a license.txt file in the Docs folder that states: (mainly interested in the 3rd statement)<br />
1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you wrote the original software.<br />
   If you use this software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be appreciated but is not required.<br />
2. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being the original software.<br />
3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any distribution.<br />
<br />
As I understood this in the beginning is that you have to include the following license agreement in all of your setup packages, but then I looked at some working setup packages that use NSIS (i.e. EMule) and I noticed that they don't include this information in their license agreements. So what I would like to know I guess is - is the information from that license.txt file required to be included or was it provided just as an example?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for all the help,<br />
<br />
Sanek.</div></div><hr />

NSIS is free/open source which means everyone is able to download/modify the source code and recompile, thus obviously this notice affects such cases.<br />
In your case I think what is matters is this:<br />
