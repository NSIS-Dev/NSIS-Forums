<br />
I try running the installation from a CD<br />
and got some strange stuff:<br />
<br />
the progress bar looks like it starts, but it does it in a loop,<br />
when I close the explorer window it start running<br />
(does it make sense ?)<br />
<br />
I dont think the file is damaged nor the CD,<br />
<br />
is there something I should add ?<br />
I think I saw something about running the installation from a network<br />
but can't remember where,<br />
<br />
did anybody got same problem ?<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
I'm using a modern UI (2.04b)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet this is a bug,<br />
(but must have the specific conditions)<br />
<br />
I just tested from another CD,<br />
<br />
as I said, it only happen if U run it from an explorer window<br />
(of the CD - it will NOT happen running using a Windows Commander)<br />
<br />
anyway, progress bar just keep dancing until explorer window is closed,<br />
<br />
I bet it will happen 2 U 2,<br />
just create a modern UI and try 2 run it from a burned CD (with explorer)<br />
<br />
I think I'm not on drugs today,<br />
so I really hope 2 fix this sometime...<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />

There are still some details missing. I need to see your script. Does it happen with other scripts? Does it happen with NSIS 2.0b3 or 1.98? Why is there no text on the dialog?</div></div><hr />
