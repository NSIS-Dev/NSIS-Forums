<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madali_na</div><div class="date">28th July 2008, 07:01</div></div><div class="posttext">My main concern is this:<br />
I have created a nsi file using Venis which I am using to launch the installer for Crystal Reports as follows:<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;$INSTDIR\CrystalReports\CRYSTL32.EXE /Q&quot; <br />
<br />
What I want my program to do, is to complete a particular installation checking on it's own the type to be installed and inserting the license number from a file so that the user does not have to know about it.<br />
<br />
I've tried to read the manual but I'm at a loss as to where I might find the information I need.<br />
Some tips (any tips) would really help me.</div></div><hr />

They seem to have a mechanism for installing silently, and they may provide a command-line solution for entering in the license number.<br />
<br />
The other type of solutions that are available if this doesn't work have to do with programs that send key-strokes to a program.  That would be a fairly complex project I'd imagine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.  You could try running CRYSTL32.EXE /? to see if the EXE itself reveals any extra command lines.  If not, then you should probably look to CrystalReports (http://businessobjects.com) for more info.  <br />
<br />
Also, your ExecWait command should probably be enclosed in quotes like this:<br />
<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\CrystalReports\CRYSTL32.EXE&quot; /Q'</div></div><hr />
