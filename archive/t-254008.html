<br />
I could not find a 100% negative answer to what I am looking for in the documentation and FAQs, so allow me to ask:<br />
We have to tell quite a lot of users to modify their settings for Microsoft Office, i.e. &quot;Open your Add/Remove Programs Panel, Select MS Office, click on 'Advanced' .....select this options .... click NEXT ...&quot;, which is quite risky as not all users are power users.<br />
<br />
I looked at other scripting options (e.g. Autohotkey) but they offer no specific hooks into the installation area.<br />
<br />
Although I believe that NSIS is not usable to modify other installations _not_ generated by it, still the question to the experts:<br />
<br />
Is it possible to control the settings of other applications (like in this case MS Office)?<br />
<br />
If &quot;yes/maybe&quot;, what is needed as info about the other applications (e.g. Registry addresses), and if this is known, is the info reliable or differing depending on the machine?<br />
Also if &quot;yes/maybe&quot;: anyone knowing an example for this (could not find one in the available ones)?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
Toni</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps if you were clearer on exactly what you are trying to do and/or modify someone might be able to better answer your question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Applications store their settings either in system registry or config files (where exactly, it's up to you to find out. Using the brain and some tools (Regmon/Filemon) or just relying on Google).<br />
NSIS provides registry and file read/write operations. So &quot;yes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to add a feature to an Office installation, use msiexec.exe. The command-line interface of the Windows Installer.<br />
<br />
I dont have the possibility to try out this command line. Its just here for reference to give you a hint.<br />
<br />
msiexec /i officefilename.msiORproductcode ADDLOCAL=myFeature /qn<br />
<br />
This will add the feature myFeature to the office installation in silent mode. Remove /qn to show the dialogs.<br />
<br />
To find out what the name of the feature is, I suggest you to analyze the log file (temp directory) after the manual installation or dig into MSDN/deploy guides for Office.<br />
<br />
After figure out this command line, just write a batch file or a nice nsis script (to check return values, whatever).<br />
<br />
Please let me know if it works.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day!<br />
<br />
