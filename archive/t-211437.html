<br />
You can download it from: http://www.tibed.net/files/vpatch3releasecandidate.zip<br />
<br />
Kichik, can the new updated NSIS plug-in be included into CVS?<br />
It can be found in the archive under &quot;VPatch\Source\NSISPlugin&quot; and all the paths are 'set' for the NSIS Contrib path location and building into the plug-ins folder.<br />
The plug-in is completely backwards compatible, but newly generated patches in v3 need this updated plug-in to leverage the new features such as MD5 checksums and file date preservation. Now that 2.06 is out this is a good time to put it in CVS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I have attached the source code of the updated NSIS plugin (as  well as a compiled version, vpatch.dll). Everything in the folder &quot;NSISPlugin&quot; goes into &quot;Contrib\VPatch\Source\Plugin&quot; of the NSIS folder, and then you're set to compile the Visual Studio Workspace (just set it to Release Build and the file will be put in the right place).<br />
<br />
This code is the same as included with VPatch 3 RC6 but that one does not include a binary.<br />
<br />
I'd like this code to be put in NSIS CVS so the updated plugin can be in the next version.</div></div><hr />
