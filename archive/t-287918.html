http://nsis.sourceforge.net/DotNET<br />
<br />
I want to thoroughly test all the installation scenarios, especially since I had noticed some oddities about the script and it's behavior and have also made some local edits to it.<br />
<br />
I am using the version for installing MSI as well.  However, I need to figure out how to uninstall MSI 3.x so that I can test how my installer will behave when MSI does not exists, to verify that it detects this properly.  It appears that my fresh installation of Win XP Pro SP2 includes it.  <br />
<br />
Is there a way to uninstall Microsoft Installer that anyone knows of?<br />
<br />
I tried some searches but I keep coming up with ways to use msiexec.exe to uninstall other things :igor:</div></div><hr />

So my post might be confusing with any context.  It was a link to the DotNET script on the NSIS wiki for detecting MSI and .NET Framework 2.0 and installing each if necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">3rd March 2008, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't look like it can be removed. You'll have to use virtual machines to test this. Have a snapshot at a clean state of the operation and test the installer on it.</div></div><hr />

When it has been added, there is an entry to uninstall it in the Add/Remove programs applet.<br />
<br />
If you have access to Win2k, you might test your installer there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AaronLS</div><div class="date">3rd March 2008, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">It is on Virtual PC.  It is a fresh install and I have not downloaded any updates.  I think it may automatically be included with WinXP Pro, or maybe WinXPPro SP2(which is what I have).  I'd have to find an old install disc that doesn't include sp2 to see if that is the case.  <br />
<br />
I even tried deleting the msi.dll and it keeps getting recreated(probably self repair, but if msi provides the msi self repair feature, who is repairing the msi.dll? LOL).</div></div><hr />

Good to know, I'll check our msdn subscription for that.</div></div><hr />
