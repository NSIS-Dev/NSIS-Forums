<br />
I tried twice and still need more time to understand what's going on with that modern UI.<br />
<br />
Too complex compared to normal GUI, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 21:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you try the latest version of the Modern UI?<br />
<br />
The latest version is really easy to use. You only have to insert a few lines of code and everything is set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dick4</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">the modernUI much more confusing than the original UI, but they have made it a little easier with the more recent releases.  There is a lot less code to put in now.  <br />
<br />
I think its more confusing because it forces you to declare variables, insert macros and &quot;include&quot; things.  I never had to learn that with the old interface.<br />
<br />
One Question, I grabbed the CVS version today and noticed 2 things:<br />
<br />
1] BrandingText doesn't seem to be changing the text<br />
<br />
2] in the output screen of makensisw.exe (after you compile), both &quot;Test Installer&quot; and &quot;Tools&quot; use &quot;T&quot; as the &quot;Alt-&quot; character.  If you hit Alt-T it does &quot;Test Installer&quot;.<br />
<br />
*edit* I did some testing with BrandingText and it changes it ONLY if its after the line that reads: !insertmacro MUI_SYSTEM<br />
<br />
If its before that then it doesn't change it.  Maybe I'm missing a variable somewhere?  I tried reading the Readme.html for it, but nothing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alt+T should now do Tools.  It will be in the next snapshot.</div></div><hr />

Have a better look at the Readme :D<br />
<br />
Before you insert MUI_SYSTEM: !define MUI_BRANDINGTEXT &quot;Some text&quot;</div></div><hr />
