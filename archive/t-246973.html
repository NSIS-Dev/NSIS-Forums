<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont expect anyone to just magically know why my $INSTDIR isnt fully being deleted, I've tried moving all file handles off it before cleaning up, etc. I dont get why it leaves behind 6 directories in $INSTDIR, all empty, plus , its very odd to me that none of these directories were used or referenced or allocated a file handle etc.<br />
<br />
the whole $INSTDIR is empty too (0 bytes total), but has a subtree still existing with these 5 directories and their relevant subdirs, it cleans up $TEMP and other install locations fine, just not $INSTDIR, as I said before I've setoutpath to somewhere other than $INSTDIR before cleaning up.<br />
<br />
any clues would be appreciated although I know someone can't just magically know, well maybe.<br />
<br />
thanks people.<br />

edit: yeah, I know theres 3 rmdirs for instdir in there but that was merely me testing stuff :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I place some files in $CFDIR\customtags\ but .onAbort cleans up $CFDIR absolutely fine.<br />
<br />
its just $INSTDIR that leaves behind 6 directories, with subdirs, that I didn't even use or reference in the install, very odd, I mean directories that I DID reference got deleted ok.<br />
<br />

I'll try deleting them individually in the abort function a minute.</div></div><hr />

It's better, when you know that your installation creates files/directories on target that you want to clean up, to ${Locate} them and remove them by the safe way. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 12:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, again, I've tried this and it leaves the same folders from before, there MUST be something saying that I cannot delete it, but I'm unsure as to what as I never referenced any of these dirs inside the $INSTDIR.<br />
<br />
its funny how the subdir I make in $TEMP cleans up perfectly and I was referencing that all the way through, and running various things from that location. anyway, heres my code, I know theres an RMDIR and a Delete, I was just trying things out, seems I can't get the locate method to work for me either, I use the locate method in the same way to set file permissions for the whole subtree, so I'm stumped :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Function delete<br />
# callback function for locate, just delete current file<br />
  Delete $R9<br />
  RMDir $R9<br />
  Push $0<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
# custom abort function, called on setup abort<br />
Function .onAbort<br />
# stale file handles would stop something being deleted<br />
  RMDir /r &quot;$CFDIR\customtags\icm&quot;<br />
  RMDir /r &quot;$TEMP\${gossTemp}&quot;<br />
  Delete $TEMP\testlogin*<br />
  Delete c:\adminapi.log<br />
  RMDir /r &quot;c:\inetpub\wwwroot\web&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath $TEMP<br />
  # why doesnt this delete $INSTDIR fully?<br />
  # it leaves behind completely irrelevant folders that we didnt even use in the installation<br />
  RMDir /r $INSTDIR<br />
  ${locate} &quot;$INSTDIR&quot; &quot;/L=FD /M=*.*&quot; &quot;delete&quot;<br />
  call unloadLocate<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">if I put a messagebox in the callback function displaying $R9, I can see the files locate finds, and they are the right ones.<br />
<br />
however, calls to rmdir and delete do nothing .. woot! <br />
<br />
(ponders to think what file handles are on the dirs, none)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Please attach your script. Also, which NSIS version are you using?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using NSIS 2.16<br />
<br />
I'd love to attach my script but I think its out of company policy :(<br />
<br />
sigh, it'd be nice of course if those rogue dirs would dissapear, everything else I tell to dissapear does, regardless of file handles used or whatever. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorted, I moved the locate line to near the end of the finish page, and now it seems its working perfectly, I had it in a section before obviously being activated by the MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES page, maybe a handle was getting allocated there in the middle, who knows. <br />
<br />
anyway it works great now, so thanks everyone for looking, now onto other issues hehe! :)</div></div><hr />
