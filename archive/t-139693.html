<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">21st June 2003, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried applying the following parameter to ExecWait and though the script builds without errors, it doesnt' work as intended... I really need an idea on whats wrong...<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\start.bat&quot; &quot;SW_SHOWMINIMIZED&quot;'<br />
I checked the documentation but I feel theirs something I just don't understand in regards to parameters... Is the above code correct and or maybe I have it in the wrong place (the file launches, just not minimized)?<br />
<br />
Can someone please help me with thi question?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">o_owd</div><div class="date">21st June 2003, 07:30</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't think is possible to start an application minimized with ExecWait. try instead to start a shortcut to your start.bat and set the shortcut propreties to start minimized.<br />
<br />
you can always use nsExec plugin.<br />
the doc sais &quot;nsExec will execute command-line based programs and capture the output without opening a dos box.&quot;<br />
read the docs in your nsis\contrib\nsExec. hope it will help.</div></div><hr />

See here: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=261&amp;instances=0,11,211<br />
<br />
You should have seen that!<br />

<br />
I realized the quickest and dirtiest way I can possibly achieve the launching of the program would be to do so through a shortcut which already carried the parameters. In theory it should work but ExecWait will never even call the shortcut.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried nsExec before as I never heard of it so thanks for the link. I read up on all the documents in the folder and it might seem like a contender but I am so far unable to get it to work... I might have the whole idea about it wrong in a sense, am not sure.<br />
<br />
Thank you Afrow UK,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help on the previous thread in regards to INI field matching. Unfortunately I believe the document in which you linked me too hasn't yet applied the &quot;SW_SHOWNORMAL, SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED and SW_SHOWMINIMIZED&quot; parameters into the script. It says those are planned for the future.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it to prove anything but in a sense wanted to avoid the pains of frustration in case I would have indeed been chasing my tail if I had attempted to.<br />
<br />
So in short this piece of code is non-existent<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\start.bat&quot; &quot;SW_SHOWMINIMIZED&quot;'<br />
Cool, I didn't want to go crazy thinking I had it wrong all along...<br />
<br />
Any more ideas about how to get ExecWait to start up minimized or even possibly hidden all together?<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your time</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you the creator of the script in which Afrow UK had linked me too? Correct me if I am wrong but the script hasn't yet been applied the ability to minimize an executable? Correct?<br />
<br />
Thank you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">22nd June 2003, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, this is the only thing that I can not do now (See below the functions that I made until now, or that is based on ideas from some other functions or ideas, the best one for me is the &quot;Advanced Search in String&quot;).<br />
<br />
 (I don't know if it is possible using &quot;SendMessage&quot; command)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Deguix,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the script you've already made :) I am actively trying to call nsExec after install on the finishpage and to call it again with a different command at uninstall.<br />
<br />
I so far managed to use nsExec to call a file during install and it works beautifully. Now just get nsExec to work after install and before uninstall is the trick :)<br />
<br />
Thank you again Deguix and everyone else for your time. It is absolutely and without a doubt appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">To execute a shortcut you need to use ExecShell. ExecShell also allows you to start a program minized so you don't need to create a shortcut.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is priceless information. Thank you very much for sharing that with me. Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />
