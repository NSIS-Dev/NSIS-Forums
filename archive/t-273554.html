<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anttip</div><div class="date">28th June 2007, 13:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I need to install a virtual network adapter. I checked the existing example (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Driver_installation_and_update)  that uses newdev::UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices and setupapi::SetupCopyOEMInf, but I don't know if these can be used for this case.<br />
<br />
The driver consists of .inf and .sys files. I tried to point the example driver installation script to the .inf file and set the HardwareId to dni_dnemp, which is what regedit shows as hardware id (in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\DNI_DNEMP) if I manually install the driver. The test failed with error codes (XP:0,2) and #2 (XP).<br />
<br />
I haven't done anything with drivers before, so I might be on completely wrong tracks here, but for me the newdev::InstallSelectedDriver sounded like a better match. Too bad I've got no idea how I could try it out. It is described for example at http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library//aa906293.aspx .<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Got an error E0000203 (which other people have encountered too, no solution seems to be available). Additionally, now I have an unknown device that can't be uninstalled :)<br />
<br />
Found some comments about DPInst, and tried to check that out, but the Microsoft pages aren't too informative. Seems that it's a part of WDK driver kit, but found only download links to some Vista beta versions of that. Additionally, it sounds like it's some kit for VisualStudio, which is not what I'm after.</div></div><hr />
