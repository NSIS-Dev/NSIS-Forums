<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tbednarz</div><div class="date">6th January 2006, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I read most of the discussions in this forum about PocketPC installations. However nothing seems to cover my needs so far, but maybe somebody has written a plug-in in the meantime.<br />
<br />
The thing is, that I need to write data to the registry of the PocketPC that is generated during the installation process. In a CAB File one can only define static data such as registry keys containing default configuration values etc.<br />
<br />
I need to write to the devices registry even BEFORE anything is copied to the device (any cab file is transfered to and executed on the device). Using commercial installers such as InstallShield this could only be done by developing a custom setup.dll with built-in RAPI calls.<br />
<br />
For use with NSIS this could be done by writing a plug-in containing RAPI calls. Has anybody maybe already done such a thing? If not is there any interest in such a plug-in?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback.<br />

C:\MS Pocket PC\support\ActiveSync\Inc<br />
C:\MS Pocket PC\support\ActiveSync\Lib<br />
<br />
And help me with testing I will try to port Registry plugin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have downloaded your registry plug-in and will have a look at your C code. I think the API's are slightly different and use differend headers etc. But I will look at it and send you private email to the address that is given in the readme of the source code.<br />
<br />
OK?<br />
