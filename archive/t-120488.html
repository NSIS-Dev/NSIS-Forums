I wish to find out if there is a possibility to run NSIS from the command line to compile a script? <br />
It would be great to know also if it is possible to set parameters at the command line to modify a script before it compiles?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

At the beginning it was only through the command line using makensis.exe. Later on Robert Rainwater made MakeNSISw which is a Windows wrapper for makensis. Open up a DOS box go to your NSIS directory and type makensis, it will give you all the help you need (use /X to add commands to the scripts, or /D to define something which can be later used in the script [you can find an example for this one in the FAQ]).</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, after getting to DOS I do not seem to see the /X and /D commands you mentioned. I was also unable to find an example in the FAQ. I have no idea if I am looking at the correct place.  Would you be able to attach or lead me to the example?<br />
<br />
Another question: How do I modify and existing script from the command line to add files into the installer?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To modify an existing script (add File commands) you can use any text editor. You can use a console text editor, but why don't you want to use a normal Windows text editor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">To get the help you first need to CD to the NSIS directory and then execute makensis.exe.<br />
<br />
The &quot;How can I make my script depend on some registry value/the version of my product/&lt;something dynamic&gt;?&quot; question in the FAQ explains how to change the script with the command line.</div></div><hr />
