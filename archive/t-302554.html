<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnE</div><div class="date">29th January 2009, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Could anyone let me know how from the finish page I can link back to the component selection page. I need the user to either finish or go back to select another or the same component again to install.<br />
<br />
The various options have different custom pages that are run, so I cannot go back just a fixed number of pages.  Also the Back button on the finish page is disabled. I understand that is is due to it not allowing the installation function to run again, but I want to get back beyond this to the component selection.<br />
<br />
I have had a search around but cannot see any functions to do this. Would I need to create a custom finish page, and if so, even then how do I get back to the components page.<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The number of pages it counts depends on your source code, not on whether those pages are actually displayed or not.<br />
<br />
However.. going back past InstFiles is... iffy at best, and there's no standard built-in way to go back a page in general.<br />
Any particular reason you would need this functionality that couldn't be re-worked to let the user do the needed things from the get-go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnE</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. I saw that article, but was concerned about the &quot;iffy&quot; statements people are making. Thanks for clearing up how the pages are numbered.<br />
<br />
The installer includes a script to upgrade SQL databases and depending how many systems they have they may want to run that more than once, but also when they have updated the database, depending on the result, they may then wish to upgrade another part of the system.<br />
<br />
I have considered just execing the installer again. Juts had a though there. Don't know whether the installer can accept parameters and based on that skip the welcome page, in which case I could launch it again and it would go to the components page.  When runnint on Vista though would come up with UAC request again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, you can feed an installer command-line paramers.  See the help file - or the wiki - for handling those.  Alternatively you could set a (temporary) registry value.<br />
<br />
As far as UAC goes - I haven't tried this - but if you are already elevated from the installer, then the process it spawns (the installer) shouldn't pop up another UAC?  Unless installers are exempt from that behavior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnE</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. Looks like that will be the way then. I will need to put another button on the finish page that will relaunch the installer.</div></div><hr />
