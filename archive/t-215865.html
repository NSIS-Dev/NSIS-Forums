<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gato Muerto</div><div class="date">13th May 2005, 02:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I found out that a particular print run of a program has some corrupted files.  As such, we need to either send out brand new CDROMs, provide a 200+MB file that is the equivalent of the CDROM via internet (helloooo bandwidth charges), or make a patch that will install the 10 megs of actual &quot;corrupted&quot; files and copy the rest from the CDROM to the hard drive.  I am trying the latter.<br />
<br />
My problem is that this is for non-technical users.  I want to make a standard patch that will search for the correct drive letter that holds the original CDROM.  It will verify that the files are correct by comparing for file &quot;X&quot; in the drive location.  I can't assume what CDROM letter it will be, although I suppose that I can include a prompt to say what drive letter that the CDROM is at.  I just prefer to make the whole operation seamless and user-non-interactive as possible (idiot-proof, if you will).  I have looked around, and can't seem to find the exact idea on the boards.  My idea of the code (in non-code language) is as follows:<br />
<br />
Set Drive ?:\ to D:\<br />
Begin:<br />
Look in Drive ?:\<br />
If File Verifyfile.xxx exists in directory  Data\, then<br />
  copy files xxx-yyy to directory $INSTDIR<br />
  If Drive ?:\ != Z:\ then<br />
     Drive ?:\ = Drive ?+1:\<br />
     goto Begin:<br />
  Else messagebox &quot;CDROM not found, please insert CDROM and click OK.&quot; OK, Cancel #message box entries<br />
    If OK, set Drive ?:\ = D:\<br />
       goto Begin:<br />
    Else Quit:</div></div><hr />

I have a general idea of how the script is supposed to be done, but I really don't know how to SAY what I need to the computer.  This is helping me get more familiar with how NSIS interacts with the computer.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
