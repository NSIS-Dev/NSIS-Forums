<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brim4brim</div><div class="date">2nd November 2010, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'm using this script here:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Copying_files_to_pda<br />
<br />
which works great for small files like a text file (config file) or other files.<br />
<br />
And I have another script that will install my cab from the pc over active sync.<br />
<br />
However, I need to copy my cab file to the device too so users can reinstall the application if they need to as their devices are running pocket pc 2003 and if the battery dies, the device loses the program installation on the device and has to install from the cab file again.<br />
<br />
On these particular devices if the cab file is in a particular folder, it will auto-reinstall along with the device drivers etc... when the battery dies.<br />
<br />
I am using the linked script to try to copy the files but the copying is very slow.  Is there a faster way to copy files to handhelds?  It seems to be the buffer size is too small when writing it from reading up on FileRead.</div></div><hr />
