<br />
I bought a new laptop yesterday. But when I try to install something new, I get a pop-up message like this :<br />
<br />
NSIS Error<br />
Error Launching Installer<br />
<br />
Then I tried to install a new version of Microsoft Installer, but this time i got this:<br />
<br />
Extraction Failed<br />
The system cannot find the path specified.<br />
<br />
And when I tried to install WinRAR, a message said that the exe file couldn't opened.<br />
<br />
But the interesting thing is that I installed MSN Messenger without any problem.<br />
<br />
I can't even install any version of the NSIS just because of the same problem.<br />
<br />
So what do you say?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

What happens if you put %TEMP% into Windows Explorer.<br />

If you get a CRC error, the answer is there. If you get &quot;Error Launching Installer&quot;, the answer is probably there as well, but the problem is different. If you get &quot;Error Launching Installer&quot;, then the installer can't read itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
discovered that there was a unicode letter (Ä) in the path. Putting the file somewhere else where no unicode characters are in the path solved the problem.<br />
<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am using Chinese Windows, I downloaded Googletalk installer and it was not launching because the default language for non-unicode applications in Windows was set to Chinese, so I changed it to English, rebooted the computer and we<br />
when launching Google talk installer after that, I was getting:<br />
<br />
&quot;NSIS error&quot;, &quot;Error launching installer&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem as stated above was that the installer could not recognized the path which contained Chinese characters. Moving the installer to a location where the path did not contained Chinese characters fixed this. (C:\ in my case).<br />

Just use a character that is not mapped in the current codepage for non-Unicode apps configured for your system<br />
<br />
On my French Windows, i just added an arabic character to the filename of the installer executable, and I get the &quot;Error launching installer&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there an open bug about this ? or is there no solution ? (until the Unicode-NSIS initiative comes out)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th February 2008, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no solution but Unicode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">8th February 2008, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">alright.. then maybe a more adequate error message could be displayed...<br />
something like:<br />
&quot;Error launching installer. Make sure you only use basic characters in the file name and path&quot;<br />
<br />
(I tried to find a message everybody would understand, plus I don't think this error would popup for other cases like access denied or such, as the user was able to launch the process, it must have read access to it)</div></div><hr />
