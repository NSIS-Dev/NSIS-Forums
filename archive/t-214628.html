<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stb</div><div class="date">1st May 2005, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the minimum requirements for a NSIS installer? 80386/80486/Pentium? What about memory usage? Something like 100KB + size of datablock + lzma dictionary + size of compressed datablock?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Theoretically, NSIS can work with all flavors of Windows starting with Windows 95.  So I suppose as long as your hardware can support Windows 95+ you should be OK.<br />
<br />
But, keep in mind that any plugins or advanced interfaces could demand more from the hardware.  <br />
<br />
And finlly, there's a difference between &quot;will it work&quot; and &quot;will it work well&quot;.  Just becuase a PC meets the minimum requirements doesn't always mean it will have acceptible performance.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line is that this will likely be a judgement call for you-you may just have to play it and decide for yourself what works and what doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">All of that plug-ins that come with the NSIS package have the same requirements as the installer itself unless otherwise mentioned.<br />
<br />
The memory requirements are very small, except for LZMA's memory requirements. LZMA's decoder allocates memory for its dictionary, which is 8MB by default. Memory the size of the datablock is never allocated.</div></div><hr />
