<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kdeslauriers</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have looked through several threads and have yet to find the answer to the following.<br />
<br />
I have multiple instances of a program and each has its own install directory with its own copy of the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
I would like to uninstall the instance of the program that corresponds to the uninstaller that is executed.  I have no problem doing such if I knew which uninstaller was executed once I get to un.onInit.  $EXEPATH, etc are of no help since the uninstaller is copied to the temp holder when it is called.<br />
<br />
Currently, I am able to select the instances to uninstall when any of the uninstallers are selected but I would like to know if there is a way to write the uninstaller so that each uninstaller is linked to its own instance and can only uninstall its own instance.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
