<br />
I have been using NSIS for a bit and this is the first time I have had trouble WRT Virus scan. I wrapped up my visual basic 6.0 program (AA-ServerEdit_v240.exe) with NSIS v2.08, and I released it in to the wild for anyone to download, its a plugin of sorts for Americas Army Game.<br />
<br />
Anyhow there has been alot of user downloading it and having no trouble using it.  But one user decided to scan the software at http://virusscan.jotti.org and found a W32.Generic INFECTED/MALWARE. Well I use the Modern UI and have done a bit of reading and found a few reports of false positives. Now I running NIS2005, NAV2005, Spybot search and destroy, and NoAdware to protect me and the software I compile. I have also gone to StopSign and done a full scan &amp; have scaned complete HD with NAV2005 with the latest data, and have not found and VIRUS or worm or anything.  But the software still has this reading from the http://virusscan.jotti.org site , so I am going to make an assumption here and say there is a posible problem with the NSIS 2.08 wrapper software.<br />
<br />
Now I not trying to point fingers, I just want to figure out where the problem resides. Whether it be something on my system or if there is still a problem with NSIS false positives.<br />

Any resolutions for this problem would be great, or to just let you guys know this is happening.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your help,<br />

I use InstallDir Kyes as well in my software, could this maybe be related to the other post?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">21st August 2005, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The log shows that only a relatively unknown anti-virus product (ArcaVir, see http://www.arcavir.com/) finds a virus. You should contact the ArcaBit company and send them a false positive report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vazagothic</div><div class="date">22nd August 2005, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">My company experiences similar problems - since we've updated the NSIS version to 2.08 (a week ago) I've received about 15 calls about the NSIS error (corrupted installer).<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem resides with the online scanner/anti-virus, closing the connection thus causing the corruption.<br />
<br />
I've asked few of our problematic clients which anti-virus software they use and AVG seems to be the main cause, though one client mentioned Norton - but in that case there was still a chance for the AVG running on the main network server (government network).<br />
<br />
I love NSIS and I want to use it, but I'm not the one pulling the strings in my company - if my boss decides it's time to switch to something else, I will be forced to do so.<br />
<br />
For now - I can handle few more clients without causing too much troubles.<br />
<br />
Edit: To not sound too harsh or anything - It was me who suggested using NSIS in my company (we've been using Install Shield before) and I'm the only person writing installer scripts. <br />
<br />
As you can see, if my boss decides it takes too much time to support all the calls, then he may make a decision.<br />
<br />
I've used WinRAR to temporarily fix the problem:<br />
- create an encrypted WinRAR self-extracting archive<br />
- show the user how to extract NSIS installer from there</div></div><hr />
