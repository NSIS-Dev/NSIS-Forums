<br />
im wondering if there is a way to make an auto updater that will check a server for a new version or if there is a way to make it download a list of sections from a server every time the installer runs it gets a new list of options to choose from (if the list was updated)<br />
<br />
i'd be happy enough if there were something like the uninstall generator that made an update checker where you give it a url and it checks if the file is updated by viewing a text file or something then has the user download it<br />
<br />
i've seen SOMETHING about downloading used in the viralsound.com plugin and i dont know if that has anything to do with what im doing but it'd be cool anyways</div></div><hr />

http://swupdata.sourceforge.net<br />
<br />
Software Updata is written in NSIS and you can download the source there (although it might be hard to get you head around).<br />
<br />
Basically, it uses the InetLoad NSIS download plugin by Takhir to do just about everything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NyNe</div><div class="date">17th August 2005, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">alright i have no idea how to use it, but i installed both the exe and the nsis plugin stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">17th August 2005, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">If you plan on using SwUpdata, you need to read the documentation that comes with it. Otherwise just download the InetLoad plugin (search this forum).<br />

Now I have everything set up but the problem i am having is that the updater does not install the files in the correct sub-directories, it just puts everything in the root directory. <br />
<br />
So if my update file has an entry like below, the file blank.dll is installed in the root install dir and not in root/mydir/blank.dll Any ideas?:<br />

I added /NOUNLOAD to the section below in main.nsh. Each file download would hang for 20-30secs without it on my pc but ymmv.<br />

WinInet detach caused up to 60 sec delay on plug-in unload, but I was sure that I solved this problem in July' version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">l_d_allan</div><div class="date">3rd November 2005, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I was installing trial-ware that uses InstallShield, and was interested to see that its auto-update checker was based on InstallShield (see attachment). <br />
<br />
I was getting ready to put in a feature request that nsis implement this capability, but fortunately did a &quot;Search&quot; (BTW: perhaps the Search field could be at the top of the page to make it more likely to be used). <br />
<br />
I hadn't realized that nsis is capable of accomplishing this. I'm a participant on several open-source projects, and have had it on the respective to-do lists of several of them to implement AutoUpdateCheck, but wasn't clear how to go about that. Also, this valuable capability seems to be more or less invisible in the documentation. <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm the only one, but I had never heard of nsis' AutoUpdateCheck capabiliy (or perhaps I need to get my alertness pill medication upped in dosage :igor: ). To me, this is a VERY valuable feature ... almost up there with generating an uninstaller.<br />
<br />
Seems like the NsisInstaller itself could/should have this capability (nsis-#.##.exe from sourceforge) ... that would give the feature much greater visibility. Also, perhaps the cleaned-up bigtest.nsi example could show how to do this (or another example)?<br />
<br />
My impression is that the AutoUpdateCheck capability isn't particularly integrated into nsis ... fwiw, my vote would be to have it directly available, as a selectable default (unless it adds greatly to the size of the installer??). <br />
<br />
(I suppose I would even be willing to offer to help out if this capability is a work-in-progress)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">3rd November 2005, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">It might not be difficult for the setup to check an update site for a newer version of the setup, download it, run it and then exit. If no newer version is found, the setup continues as normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cpukiller</div><div class="date">26th February 2006, 04:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I can tell you how I do it in my plugins.<br />
<br />
I update the compile NSIS script with the newest engine version, then the installer does the following:<br />
<br />
It tries to find and load the VS Engine, if that fails it downloads it from the web server.<br />
If it did load, it gets the version number from the engine DLL with a custom NSIS plugin/extension I made that reads the version # and compares it with the latest version. If the one on your system is older then the newest it updates it.</div></div><hr />
