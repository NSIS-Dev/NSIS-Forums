<br />
I know in Wise Installation and Install Sheild, you have a bunch of redistributables that can be included in the install.<br />
<br />
I would like to include http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&amp;displaylang=en<br />
Redistributable in my install...Is this possible in NSIS?<br />
<br />
(or is the common method just copying every single file to where it's suppose to go?)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kyle</div></div><hr />

(If you run MS's EXE with a &quot;/?&quot;, it should tell you what those parameters are).<br />
<br />
Therefore, what should work is just package their EXE with your NSIS setup and run it with an ExecWait command using the silent switch.<br />
<br />
Microsoft also pacakges some of these things as Windows installer packages, which you can use MSIEXEC to install them, which might be another option for you.</div></div><hr />
