<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mark Nascimento</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Explain it.<br />
The exe is the result of your compiled script?<br />
Is one other exefile?<br />
Happens only with exe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Provided that you're compiling/extracting the modified exe, could be that for some reason the old exe is in use on the target.<br />
You may debug this by trying to delete the old exe before the extraction of the new, e.g.<br />
Delete /REBOOTOK &quot;$INSTDIR\my_file.exe&quot;<br />
and check the reboot flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skzhe</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I try severl times, the problem is still.<br />
At the begin, I Set &quot;SetOverwrite on&quot;, the problem exists,<br />
then I changed to &quot;SetOverwrite ifdiff&quot; the problem still exists.<br />
I have a exe file named abc.exe, sometime I modify my abc.exe, and the size of this exe file changed, then I open my .nsi file, compile, and install, then I goto &quot;$INSTDIR&quot; in my computer, I found the size and time of my exe file does not change, that's say the old exe file is not be replaced. The size of the old exe is 300K, the size of new exe file is 380K, the difference is clear.<br />
I try again a minute ago, I install my setup program in virtual machine, need reboot, so I reboot, after reboot, I found the problem is still exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skzhe</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">When I use Delete /REBOOTOK &quot;$INSTDIR\abc.exe&quot;, my abc.exe is not been installed, That's say, When I finished installation and reboot(need reboot), my abc.exe is not exists.<br />
(When I was Installing, old abc.exe is running)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">err.. Delete /REBOOTOK - check for reboot flag suggested as a debug solution not a real installer.<br />
When you verify the existence of the reboot flag right after the call to Delete /REBOOTOK &quot;$INSTDIR\abc.exe&quot;, that's clearly tells you that abc.exe for some reason is in use, so it's up to you to determine why/how the file is in use thus would not be replaced.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely if you use InstallLib you need to proceed as described in documentation,<br />
