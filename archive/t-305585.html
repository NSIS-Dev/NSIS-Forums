<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cle0fus</div><div class="date">22nd April 2009, 00:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone-<br />
<br />
I am a pretty new NSIS user and have been forced to use NSIS for work. Anyway, I am no programmer...so please go easy on me. <br />
<br />
I have been using NSIS to make simple game installers for about 3 months now. You can see some of my handiwork at www.legacygames.com, some of the titles I worked on were: Clueless, Mean Girls, Pretty in Pink, Pet Pals...ect. <br />
<br />
So, I have found myself having to use NSIS for things other than installers lately. For example, I used NSIS to create an executable that spits out a config.ini file that has the install directory written in it for a game. (I know how to make the installer do this, but another company that we work with were not able to, hence the little config.exe). <br />
<br />
Now, I need to use it to make a little exe that will: <br />
1. Launch a flash movie in full screen. <br />
2. Close the movie after about 5 seconds.<br />
3. Launch the game. <br />
<br />
I can get the movie to launch with 'Exec &quot;$EXEDIR\flashmovie.exe&quot;' but I can't get the movie to launch in fullscreen. I have tried using random parameters SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED, &quot;-f&quot; and even &quot;fullscreen&quot; as a shot in the dark.<br />
<br />
I know how to launch a game executable...it's the full-screen, waiting 6 seconds and closing down the movie that are giving me problems.<br />
<br />
I had to create a flash movie with an EXE extension to get the movie to even launch through NSIS. <br />
<br />
Please feel free to let me know if I should be trying to use another program and this is not something I can make NSIS do. Again, I am not a programmer and I am not well versed in NSIS. I built a lot of game installers, but they are all based on the same script that I built one time. <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for any input you can give. <br />
<br />
Cheers, <br />
<br />

<br />
We make the flash movie here...so I think that setting up the movie itself to open in fullscreen is definitely a possibility. <br />
<br />
We will give this a try. <br />
<br />
And to answer  Anders, one of us made the movie in flash. It is a flash movie with an *EXE extension. I am not sure how my coworker made it, but I can get info on that. <br />
<br />
Cheers and thank you so much for your replies. <br />
