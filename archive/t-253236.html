<br />
I would like to check on the following issue;<br />
<br />
I have compiled an installer (Setup.exe) with its size at about 84,000 kB.<br />
<br />
However, when I right click on the installer (Setup.exe) to access its properties, i tend to receive the following error message;<br />
<br />
Invalid size or check sum of file or unsupported compression format - Native error:00008. File processing error, possible disk full <br />
<br />
There are three buttons with the error message;<br />
<br />
Abort, Retry, and the Ignore buttons.<br />
<br />
If I were to click on the Retry or Ignore buttons, the same error message keeps popping up. However, if I were to click on the Abort button, then I would be able to access its Properties.<br />
<br />
The same applies if I were to press 'Shift + DEL'  on the Installer (Setup.exe). The same error message appears and if I were to click on Abort, I would get the Windows Delete confirmation message.<br />
<br />
If i double click the Installer (Setup.exe), the Installer executes without any problem.<br />
<br />
I am not sure to what may be root cause behind this issue.<br />
<br />
I am very grateful for any advice pertaining to this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am using Windows XP SP2 to create the Installer and this problem occurs in the Windows XP and Windows 2000 OS environment.<br />
<br />
On compressing the EXE header, I am not sure what this means. Perhaps, would appreciate some explanation on this item.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just for further information, most of the size attributed to the Installer comes from the MSDE database files and the main application binary file. These files accumulate about 75% of the 84,000 kB total installer size.<br />
<br />
If you need any other further information, feel free to ask me. I am kind of lost on the cause of this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for my late reply again. I was temporarily away.<br />
<br />
I took your advice. I have un-installed NSIS version 2.15 and re-installed the latest NSIS version 2.19.<br />
<br />
I then re-compiled my sets of application into an installer. However, I still received this error message when I choose to right click on the installer or press 'CTR + C', 'DEL', 'SHIFT + DEL' keys.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, the problem seem to appear in some PCs (Including mine) but it does not occur in other PCs (With similar OS platforms). After comparing the basic differences in systems configurations between the PCs, I found out that this was due to nature of the selected compression type for the NSIS Installer.<br />
<br />
By Default, I would define the NSIS compressor as  default compressor(ZLIB) if I am not mistaken. With my PC installed with file compression applications that recognizes this compression type (E.G. ZipGenius file compressor), the error message would appear if I tried right-clicking the installer.<br />
<br />
If I were to UnInstall ZipGenius, I would not have this problem anymore. <br />
<br />
Another alternative that I tried was to keep my ZipGenius application installed and Re-Configure the compression mode of my NSIS Installer to BZIP2. This problem does not seem to occur.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Afrow very much for the advice. It's also good that I upgraded my NSIS Installer. I think it's about time to do so.</div></div><hr />
