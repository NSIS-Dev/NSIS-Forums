I have a problem that when I try to use &quot;SectionFlagIsSet&quot; with the section ${SEC_DB} the compiler gives me an error of unknown variable/constant for ${SEC_DB} and doesn't recognize the section.<br />
Three things that may be important: <br />
1) This line comes before the section is defined and I don't know if it matters.<br />
2) I call the section from another section.<br />
3) I use Eclipse SDK 3.4 for the compiling, is it possible that it's just a problem with the compiler?<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate it if anyone could answer me as soon as possible because it is pretty urgent.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

2 : Section `name of section` SEC_DB<br />
<br />
This cannot possibly work as SC_DB is not defined until line 2.<br />
