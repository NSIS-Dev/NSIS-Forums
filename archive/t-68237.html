<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asmodeus</div><div class="date">10th December 2001, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">skins - just popped in my head, though i know it would create a bigger installer thus depicting the soul purpose of packing small installers<br />
<br />
links - ability to have active links in LicenseData or in the BrandingText<br />
<br />
exe search - ability to search for an exe file and then make it as the install directory (or did i just miss how it is done?)<br />
<br />
logos - BGGradient could have the ability to handle not only texts but also graphics (or active links even)<br />
<br />
make offline - i bet it is a great help if you could make the NSI Online Template Generator available offline<br />
<br />
browse - ability to change the texts in the browse window, the one that appears when searching a folder to install the application<br />
<br />
spaces available - ability to read actual available space, not just 1GB+, and perhaps also add another one that reads the size of drive. thus completing the 3 common components; size of disk, spaces available, and spaces required.<br />
<br />
&lt; Back - disregard this button in the lisence page rather than make it unavailable<br />
<br />
multiple disks - multi volume installation files so as to be able to distribute them in floppies; and option to choose the file size per volume<br />
<br />
uninstall options - so as to select which items should only be removed; the same as the repair function in the microsoft installer<br />
<br />

You could do this by read/write the path to your exe to the registry.<br />
<br />
browse - ability to change the texts in the browse window, the one that appears when searching a folder to install the application<br />
Change this text by specifying the second parameter of the DirText command.<br />
<br />
&lt; Back - disregard this button in the lisence page rather than make it unavailable<br />
I think this is done in 1.80.<br />
