<br />
1) What is the 'example' you refer to? Something in the Wiki, something in the Developer repository or something else? A name would help.<br />
2) What part/aspect of your installation isn't working?<br />
<br />
I think if you can at least clarify these two points, it might be possible to help you.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Get me out of this pit!!!!&quot; <br />
thread with the current position in the development.<br />
I hope the information provided will shed more light as to where i'm currently stuck.<br />
Thanx all the same for the assistance accorded.<br />
:) <br />
<br />
All the same the file in use (attachment in get me out of this pit thread) doesnt really help me understand the flow of the script at some point and thus I would need a place to start as far as creating scripts for vb6 programs including all 3rd party controls in use within the application.</div></div><hr />
