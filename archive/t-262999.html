<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">4th January 2007, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Suppose you're discovering that you're running on a Notebook, how does this affect the installer?<br />
If your installation is cpu specific you should check the cpu, if it is graphics specific you should check graphics, if it is ram, check ram, OS check OS and so on.<br />
The only reason I could think about, is the case when you'd like to start a large download on a machine with a slow dial up connection, so you'd like to discover if the machine is running with AC power or DC power and inform users about the  possibility of a broken installation because of the battery.<br />
Is there any other reason?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have an installer that I want to function one way on a laptop and another way on a desktop... Since it has been some time since 2007, is there anything new that anyone can think of that I can key against to determine if it is a laptop or a desktop..? I am going to look into this, but can NSIS do WMI queries..?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
