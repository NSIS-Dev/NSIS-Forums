<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrBlunden</div><div class="date">7th January 2008, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some strings in my installation script that I need to be uncompressed, because I replace them dynmically, after the installer exists as an EXE. An example for such a string is &quot;ChangeMe&quot;.<br />
<br />
I tried to use &quot;SetCompress off&quot; before writing &quot;ChangeMe&quot; and &quot;SetCompress auto&quot; afterwards. So now my installer doesn't contain the &quot;ChangeMe&quot; strings when I'm opening them with a text viewer.<br />
<br />
If I use SetCompress off once and turn compression off completely, the &quot;ChangeMe&quot; strings can be seen with a text viewer.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how to accomplish this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrBlunden</div><div class="date">7th January 2008, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I was too tired when I phrased the previous post. Let me try again:<br />
<br />
I want to use compression on my installer, but some parts I want to leave uncompressed. I know this is theoratically possible using &quot;SetCompress off&quot;.<br />
<br />
If I use SetCompress off once on the top of the script, and the installer is uncompressed entirely, strings such as &quot;ChangeMe&quot; are visible if you view the installer EXE with a text viewer.<br />
<br />
So I want to compress all the parts that don't have &quot;ChangeMe&quot; inside them, and leave the ones that do uncompressed.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to put &quot;SetCompress off&quot; before and &quot;SetCompress auto&quot; after lines that contain &quot;ChangeMe&quot;, but then I'm not able to see &quot;ChangeMe&quot; with a text viewer in the installer EXE.<br />
<br />
Any ideas why?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

It either turns compression on or it doesn't. Whatever last value you used for SetCompressor will be applied to the whole installer.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is what you're after:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th January 2008, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Afrow suggested the best solution for what you're probably looking for. There's also this (http://www.get-jabber.com/blog/index.php/2007/12/21/the-inner-workings-of-wwwget-jabbercom/).<br />
<br />
As for SetCompress, if it's set to off at the end of the script, the headers won't get compressed. It's the headers that contain the file names which I suppose you refer to when you say &quot;ChangeMe&quot;. Any files added between SetCompress off and SetCompress auto will not have their content compressed. Their name, however, depends on the value used for the last SetCompress as explained.</div></div><hr />
