<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdm</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read copious amounts about using InstType for &quot;Typical&quot;, &quot;Default&quot;, etc...<br />
<br />
I have a command line arg install option and (if no command line args) a user interface option (specify INSTDIR, USERNAME, PASSWORD). I have both of these functional, but it seems that they are mutually exclusive; <br />
 1.DirText, Page all need to be outside any Section or Function and as soon as you do that, they spring up by default, thus shorting out my command line install<br />
 2.I have been trying to use Section, SubSection, SectionIn to make the two install methods invisible to each other and have not been successful. <br />
<br />
Can you use a .ini file to keep these two install options separate? If so, how?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">So, you currently have it so that if the user runs your application with command line options, you want to hide the Components page and unselect some sections.<br />
<br />
Firstly, you can skip pages using Abort.<br />
I'd set a variable (use Var MyVar to make a special one) to a value (e.g. skip) if the user has used command line options.<br />
Then, StrCmp $MyVar skip 0 +2 to Abort pages.<br />
<br />
There is a topic on this forum from not long ago which shows how selecting and de-selecting sections can be achieved.<br />
<br />
If I have understood your questions incorrectly, then sorry :)<br />
Please explain a bit more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdm</div><div class="date">30th July 2003, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got it to run, but I think its abit odd: if detect a command line argument in .onInit (&gt;&quot;&quot;), I simply avoid exiting any function until the end and then I do an Abort. This seems to keep my command line install 'blind' to pages, DirText and the rest of an interactive install that I wouldn't want. Alternatively, if I have &quot;&quot; for command line args then I exit .onInit and there are my pages. <br />
<br />
It seems like there's a better way to do it.<br />
<br />
In your reply, are you suggesting that I use something like &quot;How to control Section selections, while using SubSections &amp; InstTypes &quot; (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=121)? I had a problem understanding how to utilize that::once you're in a section then the pages become visible and I don't want that. <br />
Thanks for your help<br />
