<br />
Exec 'c:\windows\notepad.exe'<br />
ExecWait 'c:\windows\calc.exe'<br />
<br />
I've tried &quot;&quot; instead of ''.  I don't get it...</div></div><hr />

They would work much better than that of just typing out the location. Plus, someone's windir is could be different than yours.<br />

I get nothing though - not even an error message.  :/</div></div><hr />
