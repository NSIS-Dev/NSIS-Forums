<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mintus</div><div class="date">31st October 2001, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to detect if the User running the installer/uninstaller is a administrator user? I need a way which can detect if the user has administrator rights. Now my code reads the user name from enviroment variable and checks for &quot;Administrator&quot; but that does not work in non-english locales and if the user has the rights but is not named as &quot;Administrator&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I might have missed the right thread but those which I read didn't completely answer the question .. but I think I need to use external app then? .. well, maybe I just make another search on this forum..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madMatt</div><div class="date">23rd November 2001, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem! I had to be able to know if<br />
the user had administrative privileges so that I could<br />
install an NT service.<br />
<br />
The only way that I could find to do it was to create a<br />
small application myself to do the job. I have attached<br />
it for you to use as you wish along with a sample nsi file<br />
and the source code for the App.<br />
<br />
It works fine under NT and 2000 but in 98/ME it just<br />
reports that the users are not administrators - which<br />
is fine as you can't install a service on 98/ME anyway!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Matt</div></div><hr />
