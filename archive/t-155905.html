<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wasteland</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to install a large number of files, all of which are in the same directory, and I need to break them into chunks (so I can switch what BgImage is showing in the background), and I would very much like to not have to change my script every time I add a new file.  What I tried was this:<br />
<br />
; Display image 1<br />
File &quot;data/a*.ext&quot;<br />
File &quot;data/b*.ext&quot;<br />
...<br />
File &quot;data/m*.ext&quot;<br />
<br />
; Display image 2<br />
File &quot;data/n*.ext&quot;<br />
...<br />
File &quot;data/z*.ext&quot;<br />
<br />
This *would* get everything (well, assuming no files starting with numbers), but it currently errors out in the compile (MakeNSIS) process.  If I remove the offending line I risk missing new files when they get added.  Is there any easy way around this?  (Maybe a compiler flag to say I don't care if files aren't found, or a way to do wildcards with regular expressions so I could say &quot;data/[a-m]*.ext&quot;)  Or do I just have to bite the bullet and make a secondary script to generate this script and/or manually edit it whenever our data files change?</div></div><hr />
