<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pomflain</div><div class="date">2nd February 2002, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Just went through and made a batch of installers,  been working on the scripts quite a bit lately.  Anyway,  just got done with the last one and noticed that it said &quot;0 kb&quot; for the install size.  The last one just so happens to be the smallest one,  so I started going back and looking at the rest.  They all had a listed installation size of 0 kb,  except for the last one.  That one was listed as 914 kb,  which is isn't correct either.  The largest file out of all the installers,  though,  just so happens to be...914 kb.<br />
<br />
So seems like something's a bit off here.</div></div><hr />
