<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veekee</div><div class="date">19th August 2002, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeaah, i know : &quot;another compilation problem... you should search the forum for the answer... !!!&quot; !<br />
Well, yes, i could, but i don't think the answer would be present : that's the first time i have this problem...<br />
I'm making the french version of NSIS, and one of the french users noticed a bug.... CopyFiles function was crashing !<br />
Well, i tested and retested it : the french release's CopyFiles  was crashing !<br />
I replaced, file by file, all frennch sources to see what was the wrong file... none !<br />
The last idea was to recompile the english sources (just after NSIS installation into an empty directory ...) : before compilation, the script was working, but after compiling the sources (without any mods on it), CopyFiles was crashing !!! Well, i'm getting mad with that ... :( :( :( !<br />
Is anybody's the same problem ? Did my VC++ compiler become mad ??</div></div><hr />

Then I made sure that my file associations were pointing at the newly built makensis.exe and compiled examples/bigtest.nsi. The CopyFiles code in that worked fine when I ran the generated installer.<br />

:eek:</div></div><hr />

After recompiling the makensis.exe, CopyFile seems to crash. Before that it was working fine.</div></div><hr />
