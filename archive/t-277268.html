<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onu</div><div class="date">13th September 2007, 01:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm new to the entire NSIS system.  Actually, this has been my first experience in stack programming, amongst other firsts.  I've dealt with most of my issues and would like to thank all who have contributed to this project.  I've been able to get all the functionality I've wanted out of NSIS after just a couple days use.<br />
<br />
However, now I'm trying to make my installer smarter, and prettier.  nsDialogs has been the easiest (for me) to understand when it comes to making things happen.  I have an easy time creating dialogs, controls, and responding to user/system input.  It really has been great.<br />
<br />
However, being completely new to NSIS altogether, I appear to be missing pieces of the puzzle that experienced users are taking for granted.<br />
<br />
For example I'm simply trying to create an Icon with NSD_CreateIcon.  So to create the control I know I must specify the following:${NSD_CreateIcon} x, y, width, height, textHowever, I can't figure out how to associate an icon with that control so I can actually see something.<br />
<br />
Now I realize that nsDialogs was released very recently and documentation and examples are sparse.  Yet, more experienced users seem to be able to infer a lot of previous knowledge into its usage, and I don't have that luxury.  So I was wondering if someone could point me in the direction of the material I'm missing.<br />
<br />
Telling me how to create my icon would help a little, but directing me to the knowledge base on which one would discover this for themselves would help a lot.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The principle for showing them on an nsDialogs page would be the same: load the icon, get a handle on the control and display the icon.<br />

You can take that code and replace IMAGE_BITMAP with IMAGE_ICON. In the future there'd be a simple macro that does this. While nsDialogs allows you to tinker at Win32 API level with everything, it still provides a set of macros that allow non-win32-devs to easily use it. It's not complete yet and will probably never be as it should just keep growing.</div></div><hr />
