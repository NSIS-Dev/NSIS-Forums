<br />
I am an NSIS newbie and I am quite puzzled with a question.<br />
<br />
I have created several sections within my installer that represent optional installation components. I would like to execute an external program if the user has checked a particular section.<br />
<br />
The section commands -as far as I know- do not include an execution command, but only extraction/copy commands etc. I have read the NSIS manual but haven't found anything about my problem. Can you please provide any help?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fightin_Foo</div><div class="date">28th January 2008, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you try using the Exec, ExecWait, or ExecShell commands?  Kinda like this:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Launch External Program&quot;<br />
     Exec '&quot;Program&quot; args'<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Refer to the manual for the differences between the different commands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I'm afraid I've tried that. It compiles with no problem but the generated installer doesn't really execute the desired file.<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Install Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Runtime&quot; SEC05<br />
  ExecWait â€˜&quot;$EXEDIR\Prerequisites\dotnetfx.exe&quot;â€™<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Is there something I'm doing wrong?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Alright, solved it.. When you execute the application without any args, you should omit the single quotes in order for the whole thing to work. Thanks for helping out anyway.<br />
<br />
PS. I gotta admit, I'm quite impressed by NSIS's potential and capabilities :up:</div></div><hr />

Use ` &quot; or ' not â€˜ and â€™. Interesting that makensis.exe doesn't throw an error but you will find using `&quot;$SYSDIR\notepad.exe&quot;` works and â€˜&quot;$SYSDIR\notepad.exe&quot;â€™ does not.<br />
