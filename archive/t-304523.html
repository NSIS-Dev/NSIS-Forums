<br />
The situation is where I add extra bytes on the end of the installer EXE in order to customize the applications settings.<br />
<br />
Shouldn't the CRCCheck be turned off when i tell it to be turned off within the script?</div></div><hr />

Appending data to the installer can't cause this. Make sure you're not modifying anything else in the installer. Maybe your editor converts newlines (\n -&gt; \r\n).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">damiant</div><div class="date">23rd March 2009, 22:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like you guys are right. I viewed the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; EXE files in a hex editor and i was off by one byte. A bug in my code not yours.<br />
<br />
I was previously using Innosetup and it worked there and i shouldn't have assumed that my code would have worked with NSIS.<br />
<br />
By the way NSIS is an awesome way to boot strap .NET apps and actually reduces the size of the resulting EXE.</div></div><hr />
