<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">l_d_allan</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't used the .onGUIEnd function before, but it looks like it might be a good approach for a problem we've encountered. I had several questions about it:<br />
<br />
* With MUI, is there a !define that should be put in the code? This is a !define for &quot;hooking&quot; from .onGUIInit to your own function, but the documentation doesn't mention anything for .onGUIEnd. Can I proceed to use .onGUIEnd with the MUI without inadvertantly messing anything up?<br />
<br />
* With MUI, is the .onGUIEnd the very last thing called, or at least after .onInstSucess and the MUI_FINISHPAGE? Are there other standard functions called after .onInstSuccess?<br />
<br />
* Is there a way to control the sequence of functions from the MUI_FINISHPAGE (readme and the application itself) and .onInstSucess? These seem to happen at the same time.<br />
 <br />
The scenario is if I've checked the &quot;Run App&quot; checkbox in the MUI_FINISHPAGE and have an .onInstSuccess function. They seem to both behave as Exec functions, rather than one coming after the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
.onGUIEnd is called after the dialog is closed. .onInstSuccess and .onInstFailed are called before that, after the sections are executed. You can create a small test script and see this with your own eyes.</div></div><hr />
