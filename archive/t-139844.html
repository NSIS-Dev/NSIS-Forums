<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using MUI 1.65 and specifying custom icons for the installer and uninstaller. When I look at the two EXE files using Win98SE's Explorer I see the correct icons for these files.<br />
<br />
But when I right-click them and choose &quot;Properties&quot;, the uninstaller EXE does not show the correct icon in the &quot;Properties&quot; window - instead of my custom icon I see the default uninstaller icon (it seems to match the NSIS\Source\exehead\uninst.ico file).<br />
<br />
Right-clicking the installer EXE and choosing &quot;Properties&quot; shows the correct custom icon.<br />
<br />
I am also defining some 'Version Information' for these files and have tried putting the 'Version Information'  in different places within my script but this does not seem to make any difference.<br />
<br />
Any advice on how I can get the correct icon to appear on the uninstaller's &quot;Properties&quot; page ?<br />
<br />
Have solved this problem - all I had to do was rebuild the icon cache. Should have tried this before posting my message!</div></div><hr />

<br />
About version info: got the latest NSIS development version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">You were right, it was an icon cache problem. Explorer was showing the correct icon, it was only the &quot;Properties&quot; window that was wrong - so I was slow to suspect the icon cache. Now I know better.<br />
<br />
I used NSIS Update and found that I could compile the VersionInfo example, so I just added the relevant lines to my project and it worked, more or less.</div></div><hr />
