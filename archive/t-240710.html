What does this statement mean...&quot;Installers have their own VMs that let you write code that can support INI file reading/writing.&quot;  It can be found on the NSIS Features page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Features)<br />
<br />
What are VMs?</div></div><hr />

Python scripts run in a VM (I think). It means that the installers generated by nsis are not compiled to native code, therefore you don't have to pay for nsis. Have you used Visual basic? In that program you can choose to compile to native code or to p-code (VM). Nsis uses &quot;p-code&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So, from your knowledge, the VM INI file reading and writing is something that I have to code myself?  OR is that capability built into NSIS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can ignore VM really it isn't that important to you (when it comes to scripting) or the end user. I think this is just a case of someone showing off with their technical terms leaving people lower down in the computer chain in the darkness.<br />
