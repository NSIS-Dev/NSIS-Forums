<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rudif</div><div class="date">13th August 2006, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all<br />
We are using NSIS to build Win32 installers for SW developed under VC8. So far, we use the prebuilt NSIS binaries.<br />
Since NSIS binaries that would run on x64 do not seem to exist, I would like to port them.<br />
This would be a two-step process<br />
- adapt the NSIS sources and SCons scripts to build Win32 binaries with VC8<br />
- add the x64 configurations and build them<br />
The SCons 0.96.1 official release does not support VC8,<br />
but the 0.96.92 testing pre-release does.<br />
<br />
I tried to build NSIS from 2.19 sources, using SCons 0.96.92, and I ran into a build problem diagnosed as <br />
&quot;scons: *** An executable should have exactly one target with the suffix: .exe<br />
File &quot;SConstruct&quot;, line 502, in BuildUtil&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, is there anyone experienced in SCons and in building NSIS on Windows, who would like to team up with me and help with this port?<br />
I am willing to experiment and learn, but teamwork would make it go faster and more fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The sconscripts need a bit of updating for 0.96.92, mainly for the problem you've encountered. Instead of directly building the utilities with their names, it should build it with whatever name scons wants and only install it with the name we need.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, mingw.py also needs a few updates for 0.96.92.<br />
<br />
Attached is the SConstruct file I updated for 0.06.92, but never got to finish. It kind of works now, I think. It was built on an older version of SConstruct, but I merged the new changes from NSIS 2.19.<br />
<br />
BTW, even if you get it to build, there's still some work to be done for 64-bit installers. The installer stubs need some work for word-size neutrality and the compiler itself needs to write some headers with 64-bit integers. The compiler side already has an infrastructure for that using the writers introduced in 2.16 for big-endian support. However, there are no readers yet which are required to get the resource and dialog editor to work with both 32-bit and 64-bit resources.<br />
<br />
For a simpler beginning and maybe a proof of concept, you can create two makensis builds, one for 32-bit installers and one for 64-bit installers.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, any patch in this topic, including scons 0.96.92 support, will be happily accepted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the updated SConstruct. I made some progress using it.<br />
I am learning basic python, scons and nsis build tricks, as I go along.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, mingw.py also needs a few updates for 0.96.92.<br />
<br />
I am conversant with building C++ applications under Visual Studio 2005 a.k.a. VC8, for Win32 and x64.<br />
Currently I have no *nix or like tools for Win32 machines.<br />
<br />
<br />
there's still some work to be done for 64-bit installers.<br />
<br />
Right, I exepect some code adaptations before NSIS can be built for x64, and more adaptations to make it work.<br />
Also, I see in Contrib\System\Source\System.c using the _asm {...} construct being used.<br />
VC8 compiler for x64 has no _asm instruction, so I guess someone will need to move this into a x64 asm file<br />
and assemble (working with asm is not my speciality at present).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, on to my experiments, aiming at building NSIS 2.19 for Win32 on a 32-bit machine running XP SP1, with VC8 installed :<br />
<br />
<br />
I replaced the original nsis-2.19-src\SConctruct by a copy of your sconstruct[1].0.96.92.txt,<br />
and launched scons <br />
<br />
    scons: Building targets ...<br />

    scons: *** [build\release\AdvSplash\AdvSplash.dll] Error 1120<br />
    scons: building terminated because of errors.<br />
<br />
On MSDN I found this<br />
<br />
    Visual C++ Compiler Options <br />
    /GS (Buffer Security Check) <br />
<br />
    Detects some buffer overruns that overwrite the return address, a common technique for exploiting code <br />
    that does not enforce buffer size restrictions. This is achieved by injecting security checks into the compiled code.<br />
<br />
    /GS[-]<br />
<br />
    Remarks<br />
<br />
    /GS is on by default. Use /GS- if you expect your application to have no security exposure.<br />
<br />
OK, for now I assumed that NSIS has &quot;no security exposure&quot;, and after a cursory RTF{scons}M, <br />
I added to SConscript<br />
    <br />
    defenv = Environment()<br />
    defenv.Append(CCFLAGS = ' /GS-')<br />
<br />
<br />
Scons did quite a bit more this time, and it stopped just after building the chm files :<br />

MSDN (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1fdeehz6.aspx) says that memset is available in<br />
<br />
    All versions of the C run-time libraries.<br />
<br />
and gives details of these at http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/abx4dbyh.aspx.<br />
<br />
I suppose that /NODEFAULTLIB causes the problem. <br />
<br />
I stopped here for now, since I don't know how to modify linker options for this target.<br />
<br />
Where can I look it up ?<br />
<br />
Also, removing /NODEFAULTLIB for all builds would probably cause problems elsewhere.<br />

It won't build on anything but MSVC and as a 32-bit target. Sadly, the assembly and the naked functions are required in there for the callbacks and the runtime &quot;compilation&quot;. Using defenv.Append is indeed the way to add flags, but it should be done in the msvc specific code under SCons\Config\ms. _memset is indeed missing because of /NODEFAULTLIB. The new compiler probably uses it under the hood for something. Maybe it's for inline initialization of arrays, in which case, the exact code from SCons\Config\gnu can be used. For a quick fix, you can add SCons\Config\memset.c as a source code file for InstallOptions. To change linker options, append to LINKFLAGS instead of CCFLAGS.</div></div><hr />

&gt;&gt; System is quite problematic when it comes to portability. It won't build on anything but MSVC and as a 32-bit target. <br />
<br />
Sure. For now, my objective is to build NSIS with VC8 (using scons), so I will leave the 64-bit problems for later.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; Using defenv.Append is indeed the way to add flags, but it should be done in the msvc specific code under SCons\Config\ms.<br />
<br />
OK, makes sense. I moved my line <br />
<br />
defenv.Append(CCFLAGS = ' /GS-')<br />
<br />
from SConstruct to SCons\Config\ms, at the end of ### flags section.<br />
<br />
It works as expected (suppresses the link problem with 2 missing symbols).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; For a quick fix, you can add SCons\Config\memset.c as a source code file for InstallOptions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I added to sconscripts for InstallerOptions, LangDLL and RegTool at : files = Split(&quot;&quot;&quot;...<br />
<br />
    #SCons\Config\memset.c<br />
<br />
This solved the linker error with missing memset.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the build is stopping here<br />
<br />
<br />

scons: *** [build\release\Math\Math.dll] Error 1104<br />
scons: building terminated because of errors.<br />
<br />
<br />
MSDN says this <br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
The single-threaded CRT libraries, libc.lib and libcd.lib, have been removed. Use the multi-threaded CRT libraries. <br />
The /ML compiler flag is no longer supported. Non-locking versions of some functions have been added in cases where <br />
the performance difference between the multithreaded code and the single-threaded code is potentially significant.<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you clarify something for me : above link is using Contrib\Math\Source\mathcrt.lib as input.<br />
<br />
dumpbin /all Contrib\Math\Source\mathcrt.lib shows<br />
<br />
   /DEFAULTLIB:&quot;LIBC&quot;<br />
<br />
so it looks like this is trying to pull in libc.lib.<br />
<br />
<br />
I could not see mathcrt.lib itself being rebuilt.<br />
Where did it come from ?<br />
<br />
How could I rebuild it ?<br />

To avoid the problem you can remove the inclusion of mathcrt.lib as well as mathcrt.h and have VC add its own implementation of the mathematical functions. It'll be significantly larger, but it should work.<br />

I commented out in math.c <br />
<br />
<br />
//int _fltused;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I got this<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand the cause of this, but on a hunch I tried to rerun the same link command line, leaving out /entry:DllMain<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
This seemed to solve the entry problem, but revealed another problem, __ftol2_sse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Googling produced this advice, found at http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=125048&amp;SiteID=1<br />

<br />
This is a known bug with VS2005 beta -- and apparently still exists with the released version.  <br />
Add /QIfist to the C/C++ Command Line Additional Options pane.  It generates a deprecation warning but it works.<br />
<br />
Another option which usually works is to cast the float to an __int64 before converting it to a long:<br />
<br />
float foo = 3.14; // or any float value<br />
<br />
long bar = (long)(__int64) foo;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I added to Config\ms <br />
<br />
<br />
defenv.Append(CCFLAGS = ' /QIfist')<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed this produced multiple warnings about this option being deprecated, and the same error LNK2019: seen above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again I reran the link command in a cmd window with /entry:DllMain removed, and this time the link apparently succeeded:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I tried to edit<br />
<br />
<br />
def BuildPlugin(target, source, libs, examples = None, docs = None,<br />
                entry = None, ### entry = 'DllMain', ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but this produced a link error on the first item rebuilt <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
so I reverted it immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question :<br />
<br />
Supposing that a linking Math.dll without /entry:DllMain is the right thing to do, which settings should I edit to accomplish this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th September 2006, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Having `entry` as None is the right thing, however, you also need to remove /NODEFAULTLIB by setting `nodeflib` (another BuildPlugin parameter) to False.<br />
<br />
If Math.dll is giving you so much trouble, I suggest you ignore it for now. The real issues are in the stubs and in the compiler. Once those are ready, everything else shouldn't be too complicated.</div></div><hr />

I got NSIS 2.20 built with MSVC 2005 Express, the downloadeable kit, using effectively the method here.  <br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
1. Using Windows Server 2003 Platform SDK SP1<br />
2. Using /GS- in CCFLAGS<br />
3. Added the memset.c supplied to various SConscript files<br />
4. As shipped, this version acts more like 2.07 did when NODEFAULTLIB was selected--but I didn't myself set that flag<br />
4. Link with mathcrt.lib failed the first time with a multiple definition of __ftol2 -- I removed this symbol from mathcrt.lib using GNU objcopy, and everything has linked<br />
<br />
But seriously, on the topic of mathcrt.lib--has any progress been made recovering the source code to this?  I think relying on this binary object of unknown provenance is not defensible...:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have sucessfuly compiled a NSIS amd64 with PSDK for Windows Server 2003 R2 without the &quot;math&quot; plugin and with a limited &quot;system&quot; plugin. <br />
I can't compile the full code of &quot;system&quot; plugin because of the inline assembler. The cl.exe of the PSDK seems not understand it.<br />
<br />
Except the system::call function, this NSIS amd64 build's seems work fine :)<br />
<br />
Can somebody who have the full Visual studio solution try to compile &quot;system&quot; plugin targetting amd64?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The System plug-in will take a bit more than recompilation. It's written specifically for 32-bit Windows. You might get it to compile, but it'll probably fail at even its simplest task.</div></div><hr />

You should add TEMP_MSVC2005=yes to the build command line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: Oh shit. I'm receiving the &quot;Couldn't find a good version of libcp.lib&quot; error. :( Maybe I should update my Platform SDK.   Still, why does it happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">29th October 2006, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">You should run SCons from a MSVC 2005 command prompt and add TEMP_MSVC2005=yes to the SCons command line.<br />

I also disabled the libcp check for MSVC 2005. It is not relevant anyway because it doesn't use libcp anymore.<br />
<br />
Please try the latest CVS.</div></div><hr />

For the generated installers there is generally no problem. Only the Math plug-in uses the CRT.</div></div><hr />
