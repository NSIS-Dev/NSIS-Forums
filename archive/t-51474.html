<br />
I want to be able to do download from web or ftp server.<br />
<br />
<br />
File /REMOTE &quot;http:\\www.fileserver.com\upgrade.exe&quot; filesize<br />
<br />
File /REMOTE &quot;ftp:\\userid : passwd@ftpserver.net\upgrade.exe&quot; filesize<br />
<br />
File /REMOTE &quot;ftp:\\ftpserver.net\upgrade.exe&quot; filesize<br />
<br />
<br />
File /REMOTE [file location address] [filesize]<br />
<br />
<br />
Installer has remote file address only.<br />
<br />
What about this feature?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">2nd June 2001, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Edgewize wrote an utility to check for updates from the web (very small), but why would you want such a feature?<br />
Why can't you include those files in your download?<br />
Or are they add-on components?<br />
<br />
Can't you execute those links through Windows shell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgewize</div><div class="date">2nd June 2001, 21:47</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need the very latest version of a file, simply ShellExec a web URL from your script.  Update that web page if there is a new version, and users will see it.<br />
<br />
You do not want to have a remote-fetch installer.  Web-based setup is a Very Bad Thing (tm).<br />
<br />
-- What if the user has to pay per-minute internet access charges (in other words, all of Europe)?<br />
-- What if the user has a computer with no net access?<br />
-- What if you exceed your download limit from your web or ftp server?<br />
-- What if someone extracts the name and password from your URL?<br />
-- What if another site wants to mirror your files?<br />
<br />
Most importantly:<br />
-- What if your download site goes down or changes address?<br />
<br />
<br />
Microsoft can get away with it because they have a deal with Conexant to provite unlimited bandwidth and guaranteed uptime.  You probably do not have a deal with a major internet backbone provider.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, URLs use *forward* slashes: &quot;http://www.blah.com/path/file.ext&quot;<br />
Back-slashes only work in Microsoft products because Microsoft is trying to make everyone use their retarded back-slash convention for filenames.</div></div><hr />
