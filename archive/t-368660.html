<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SaintGTR</div><div class="date">11th August 2013, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, let me preface by saying I have already looked at a lot of documentation and I am not sure where to begin for this because I have no coding experience. I use Venis for generating new scripts and then compiling them under NSIS.<br />
<br />
My question is that I have an .ini file in the root directory of my NSIS script. I want to during setup (near the end) ask for a user to input some text in a file which in turn gets written to the ini file. <br />
<br />
For example, near the end of the setup it Prompts the user by saying &quot;Please enter your player name:&quot; and then they have the choice to enter some text in a text box which will in turn be written to the .ini file. <br />
<br />
The other thing I would like to include on that page is a drop down menu with predefined text which in turn depending on which a user chooses, gets written to the same .ini file.<br />
<br />
Can someone assist me with this?</div></div><hr />
