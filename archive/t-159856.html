<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">martinus</div><div class="date">15th December 2003, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Using zip my installer is 7MB, using bzip2 it is 2.5MB, and with LZMA it is only 1.1MB.<br />
Thanks for adding this excellent compression algorithm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">15th December 2003, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a quite good improvement :) What type of data does your installer contain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">martinus</div><div class="date">15th December 2003, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The extracted size is about 18MB, and it contains a lot of dll's. Each dll has (for some odd reason) to be statically linked against the same other libraries, which results in a lot of 200kb big dll's. I guess most of the compression comes from the large buffer LZMA uses, so it can find better matches. bzip2 is restricted to only 900kb, I do not know which window size the zip algorithm has. <br />
<br />
When having debug information in the dll's, the installed size was more than 40MB, and the LZMA compressed file is still only about 1.2MB.<br />
<br />
In my experiments always LZMA does wonders when the files are highly compressible, like text, a lot of small, almost similar files, etc.<br />
<br />
BTW, does nsis sort the files according to the file type? If this is well done, this could also improve compression a bit (at least for very large installers).</div></div><hr />
