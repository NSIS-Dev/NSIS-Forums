<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">7th September 2007, 01:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I have separate installers for two related programs.  Can I write one script for them and generate separate uninstallers?  I thought I was succeeding, by altering variables such as ${PRODUCT_NAME_1} and ${PRODUCT_NAME_2}, and PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY_1 and PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY_2.<br />
<br />
However, when I came to the uninstaller, I did not know how to proceed with separate installers, unable to detect or distinguish between the names of the products within the uninstaller code.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate some comment and direction.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th September 2007, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">All those variables are very specific to your script and are not common for every script. It's hard to say whether you can adept your script to build another installer/uninstaller without seeing it.<br />
<br />
If you have some defines that you want to compare and change the script accordingly, you can use !if ${PRODUCT_NAME_1} == &quot;something&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">8th September 2007, 04:29</div></div><div class="posttext">kichik, thank you very much for commenting.  I relied on the last character of the parent folder of each uninstaller as the distinguishing flag.  After about a day and a half of work, the result is a very clean &quot;double&quot; installer.  I had expected it to be quick and easy, but it turned out to be quite tricky for me.</div></div><hr />
