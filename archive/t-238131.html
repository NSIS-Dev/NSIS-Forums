<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luc L</div><div class="date">15th February 2006, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
I'm trying to convert some old setup files which were created in Setup Factor 6.0 to NSIS, however I do not have the time to learn the syntax and the features. <br />
<br />
The setup needs to do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Display welcome screen &amp; application name + version.<br />
2. Display license agreement yes/no (yes to proceed).<br />
3. Ask user for serial number or &quot;demo&quot; for demo version. The serials list (provided by me) should be stored in the setup somewhere, but should also be protected so people can't view the serial numbers by using a hex editor on the setup.exe. If serial matches one on the list proceed, otherwise ask for it up to 3 times. <br />
4. Create registry key for program.<br />
5. Save serial number + few other keys to registry for the application.<br />
6. Install files<br />
7. Register VB6 runtimes + few standard VB6 component OCXs(ex: mscomctl.ocs, comdlg32.ocx, etc) into the default windows\system32 folder. <br />
<br />
To someone experienced, this should take less than an hour. I already have the first 2 steps and the registry done. I'm having problems with storing and verifying the serial and with registering the .OCXs, but I'd prefer if someone did this from scratch because my work may not be to standard. <br />
<br />
$100 via PayPal to someone experienced who can do this. I'd also need the source because I may have to adjust it to work with another application which uses the same style but different serial numbers.<br />
<br />
The faster this can be done the better. I'd like a solution before the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Respond to this thread or e-mail luc (AT) lezon.com. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Luc L.</div></div><hr />
