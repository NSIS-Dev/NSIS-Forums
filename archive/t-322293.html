<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ErikKlein</div><div class="date">9th September 2010, 11:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I know there are several extensions to facilitate uninstalling installed files.<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Uninstall_only_installed_files<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Advanced_Uninstall_Log_NSIS_Header<br />
<br />
Nevertheless they don't seem to offer the functionality I'm looking for. <br />
I want the uninstaller to detect whether an installed file was changed (e.g. by checking the filedate), and leave the file if the file differs from the one that was installed.<br />
<br />
I'm a newbie, so excuse me if the question doesn't make sense.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">9th September 2010, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll have to write a custom solution.  I.e. when installing, get the timestamps off the files, store them somewhere*, then when uninstalling, compare against that list.<br />
<br />
* INI files or the registry are obvious choices as you could access the date by filename/path.  A flat file can also work, but is slow to parse.. reading each line into an Array with the Array plugin, and then searching the Array could be an option.</div></div><hr />
