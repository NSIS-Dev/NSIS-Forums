<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">25th October 2005, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
nsis doesn't currently install like a normal Unix program - instead it dumps all its stuff in one directory with a few subdirectories. At the moment for the debian package I hack around this by moving files around after the install.<br />
<br />
The attached patch against CVS gets about 50% of the way to a better install structure. One problem is that only the subs and makensis get installed when I do scons install. It contains proper DESTDIR (useful for packages), PREFIX and so on semantics, and a portability switch for Windows, where the plugins/etc are stored relative to the exe.<br />
<br />
So, I would like to know if this is the kind of thing that should be in the official nsis package. Also, could people review the patch to make sure I'm using scons right, and that I have not done anything stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th October 2005, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">To have `scons install` install all the files, you have to alias `install` to all of the directories. In the original code, `install` is aliased to $PREFIX and so everything that needs to go into $PREFIX is built and installed when `scons install` is called. I haven't read all of the changes, but it seems you need to add:defenv.Alias('install', '$NSIS_DATA_DIR')I'd love to have scons install to the proper locations on POSIX, however it must be backward compatible. Forcing users to replace ${NSISDIR} everywhere is not an option.<br />
<br />
I hope I'll get a chance to take a deeper look soon as this is definitely something that belongs in the official package.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">26th October 2005, 05:06</div></div><div class="posttext">About NSISDIR, I guess that for backward compatability sake, it could just use NSIS_DATA_DIR.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info about the aliasing. Another thing - I noticed that scons install-plugins and similar do nothing. First they barf because the directory doesn't exist, and after you create it, they do nothing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your interest, I'll keep plugging away at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">26th October 2005, 07:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Added the aliases, but after creating all the directories by hand (not sure how to make scons create the dir structure), I get this:<br />

Another thing - I noticed that scons install-plugins and similar do nothing. First they barf because the directory doesn't exist, and after you create it, they do nothing.Have you specified a PREFIX? Deleting the entire plugins directory or just its content and then using `install-plugins` works fine for me. It creates the directory, installs all of the plugins, and never complains about a missing directory.<br />
<br />
The AdvSplash.dll error might be caused by installing the DLL into the same place it's built or by installing it to the same place two times. Try running scons with --debug=dtree. It might give you some vital information.</div></div><hr />

Patch, full build log and list of installed files attached.<br />
<br />
Build log was got like so (how I'll be doing it in the debian package):scons NSIS_CONF_DIR=/etc PREFIX=/usr SKIPPLUGINS=System DESTDIR=`pwd`/debian/nsis/ install  &amp;&gt; build.txtOnly enhancements needed are to perhaps not install .lib/.def files for the plugins and add a switch to not install licence.txt (debian packages have a standard copyright file). These can wait though, and I can submit a patch later on. Be great if you could test that it all works fine on Windows too, and generally review the patch more deeply.<br />
<br />
No luck with System.c btw. If the assembly was split out to separate files and was pure assembly, I could compile it with NASM. Don't know if that'd be an acceptable solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">31st October 2005, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you so much! <br />
<br />
FYI: I'm still busy in between other tasks e.g. NSIS via MSI &gt;:-) CustomAction dll. <br />
<br />
I will however make an NSIS Win32 build of installer workable on FreeBSD, even if it takes me a year. Then, to celebrate open a wikipage to celebrate which explains all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">31st October 2005, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, but what are the sticking points for nsis working on FreeBSD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">3rd November 2005, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I started of just after the switch to scons builds... and before that I had problems of make on a sparc processor under solaris, gave that up. Tried for fun :( my OSX, build worked ok via &quot;make&quot; only makensis just did not work because of endian isses.<br />
<br />
Then patched the makensis code to be OSX compliant, halfway realizing the enormous effort. It was all new to me you see.<br />
<br />
Fine, then my mistake move files via Fat32 to FreeBSD, dumb me, Filename capitalisation of whatever.h changed. OK found out. could compile but the other errors.<br />
<br />
Then found out that I needed to update scons to the bleeding ege version .. sigh.. then to make it easier needed to install   KDE on FreeBSD, fine I'm all set to go. Now if only I had a spare day to toy around a little more of NSIS Build on FreeBSD<br />
<br />
But I WILL PREVAIL, I'm persistent ;)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, Pabs, thanks for your all sorts of great help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th November 2005, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, I haven't had the time to go over all of it, again. But I do have a couple of notes from another brief look.<br />
<br />
It doesn't start building on Windows because NSIS_CONF_DIR is empty on Windows. You should probably only append those symbols when not on Windows. After that it builds, but I haven't tested installation yet.<br />
<br />
As for the naming of the variables in the SConscutrct, I think it'd be nicer if they were all named $PREIFX_SOMETHING. It's also a bit of a standard as I see it. Most configure scripts accept --prefix-something in the command line, not --destdir or --something_something_dir.<br />
<br />
I think the define names should be a bit more special. Someone might already have BINDIR defined. NSISBINDIR would be better, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
As for the System plug-in, if it works, it should be ok. But can nasm really assemble inlined assembly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">6th November 2005, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I've addressed your concerns about the $PREFIX_* and NSIS*DIR in the attached patch. I also attached a file listing all the occurrences of NSISDIR that I'm not sure what to do with.<br />
<br />
Can you show me what you mean about Windows and NSIS_CONF_DIR (now PREFIX_CONF)? I'm not sure I understand the problem.<br />
<br />
AFAICT, nasm doesn't do inline assembly - I suggested to split out the assembly code into separate .asm files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">9th November 2005, 02:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't apply this yet, its broken in some situations. I'm also reworking it a bit so it is more consistent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th November 2005, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">This code:for define in ('PREFIX_CONF','PREFIX_BIN','PREFIX_DATA' ...):<br />
    defenv.Append(NSIS_CPPDEFINES = [(define, '&quot;'+defenv[define]+'&quot;')])Will give an error on Windows because PREFIX_CONF is not part of the environment. It's not part of the environment because its default option value on Windows is None. Same goes to all the others. Those defines shouldn't even be defined on Windows as they're not used.<br />
<br />
As for nasm, wouldn't a separate file allow you to define just functions? The current problematic functions have both C code and assembly in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">22nd November 2005, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Attached a new version of the patch. This one is tested a lot more (including the test target - need to test some more, inc the installer targets). The main highlight of this one is that I've changed makensis so that it checks some environment variables to change the PREFIX_* build-time variables at runtime. This is useful for running tests at compile time (before nsis is installed) and testing an exiting makensis against changed includes and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">23rd November 2005, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">New version. Fixed the dist* targets and made only the plugin .dlls install (not the .def and .lib files). Pending some testing on Windows and a review, I think this is ready to go into CVS (sorry I took so long).<br />
<br />
One other issue I can think of that would be useful in some parts of this is the lack of an ${EXEEXT} variable in the nsis script language.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some other comments: Even without specifying the install target, all of the files are installed. They are installed to the build directory, but they are still installed. The check for PREFIX in SConstruct should be brought back. I think NSIS*DIR should match the real directory name to avoid confusion. For example, NSISPLUGINDIR should be NSISPLUGINSDIR to match Plugins and $PLUGINSDIR. Empty defines drive CONST_STR crazy. Lots of errors arise when NSISBINDIR and friends are empty on a Windows build. NSIS_CONFIG_RELOCATABLE_PATHS should be defined for the script in the CEXEBuild constructor along with all of the other defines. Maybe a more fit define name can be found than NSIS_CONFIG_RELOCATABLE_PATHS. How about NSIS_CONFIG_POSIX_PATHS, NSIS_CONFIG_WINDOWS_PATHS, NSIS_CONFIG_ONE_DIR or something similar?</div></div><hr />

About ..\makensisw.exe, shouldn't it get that from build/release/Makensisw/?<br />

Not sure how to fix the other things. I'll investigate further.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">6th January 2006, 06:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really.<br />
<br />
How about I do the equivalent of the current patch without all the extra defines? The only changes to the current situation would be: ${NSISDIR} would point at /usr/local/share/nsis (or /usr/share/nsis on Linux, and contain Contrib, Include, Plugins, Stubs, Bin (win32 only binaries) and Menu (not sure if this should be installed or not).<br />
 The native binaries (makensis/genpat), config file, docs and examples will be located outside of ${NSISDIR}, so you won't be able to load/read/touch them from .nsi scripts (unless I add keep some of the ${NSIS*DIR} variables).<br />
 You will be able to redefine where makensis looks for its data, and config file/etc by using environment variables. This is useful for running scons test without having installed the software<br />
 Since relocatability is fairly foreign to linux/bsd/unix (although it is possible on linux and macos at least), it will be possible to use absolute locations for stuff<br />
<br />
Btw, shouldn't RegTool.bin move to Contrib?</div></div><hr />

If you want to change the installation root, why not use PREFIX? Distribute still installs even without PREFIX. On Windows, where PREFIX is empty by default, this installs everything into the build directory. To run a Python function on the HTMLs, you can write a builder. SCons documentation contains an example (http://www.scons.org/doc/HTML/scons-user/x2134.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">8th January 2006, 06:26</div></div><div class="posttext">On Linux, PREFIX_CONF and PREFIX_DATA are embedded in makensis, dictating where it looks for the config file and the plugins/etc. PREFIX_DEST is like DESTDIR from software that uses automake. Packagers (like debian) generally need to install to somewhere other than / (the root dir), but the resulting executables still need to refer to directories under / instead of where they are installed. For example:<br />
<br />
scons PREFIX=/home/pabs/debian/nsis/usr install<br />
create-deb /home/pabs/debian/nsis/<br />
<br />
Would result in makensis being installed as /usr/bin/makensis on a users system, and the plugins/etc being installed in /usr/share/nsis/, but makensis would look for the plugins/etc in /home/pabs/debian/nsis/usr/share/nsis/, which of course does not exist on the users system.<br />

I'll try to fix that empty PREFIX thing.<br />
