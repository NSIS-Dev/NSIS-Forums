<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">]CkB[Cowboy</div><div class="date">24th May 2001, 06:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I go here: http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/<br />
<br />
and see:<br />
<br />
Current version: 1.41 (5/3/01)<br />
Download: nsis141.exe (386kb)<br />
v1.41 <br />
Added support for version/date storing in CompareDLLVersions and CompareFileTimes (based on ideas of Davison Long) <br />
Made File/InstNSPlug commands use memory mapped files (generally ~20% faster, uses less memory on large adds) <br />
Made the datablock buffer use a memory mapped file when the datablock grows beyond 16MB. This lets you build larger installers without requiring that much physical memory. <br />
<br />
Then, I go here: http://www.firehose.net/free/nsis/<br />
<br />
and see:<br />
<br />
Current version: 1.42 (5/6/01)<br />
Download: nsis142.exe (387kb)<br />
v1.42 <br />
Made it so that installers can take command line switches: /S (silent), /NCRC (no CRC checking) and /D= (sets output directory). Note that /D= must be the last parameter on the line. <br />
Made it so you can specify &quot;&quot; or no parameter to ComponentText to not display the Component page and automatically install all sections. <br />
Made it so that if you use DirShow hide, but still specify a valid DirText, it will still show the directory page if .onVerifyInstDir fails. <br />
Made it so you can specify &quot;&quot; or no parmater to DirText to not display the Directory page (ever). <br />
Made WriteReg* and DeleteReg* allow variables in subkey. <br />
Simplified some of the uninstall parsing code. <br />
Fixed InstallDirRegKey's handling of strings that point to an EXE that doesn't exist (it assumed that the EXE name was the directory if the EXE didn't exist, but now it only thinks the EXE name is a directory if there is a directory that exists there) <br />
Made it so the installer is always shown at the end of the install, if hidden with HideWindow and window auto-closing is off. <br />
Added SetAutoClose command/instruction (lets you override AutoCloseWindow) <br />
Added /WINDOWS switch to InstallColors <br />
Documentation overhaul <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
What is the actual latest version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arune</div><div class="date">24th May 2001, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">That is really a difficult question :-) Are you serious? <br />
The version number works like this: The higher, the newer! <br />
If you´re still not certain, you can always look at the date, the same there: The higher the newer!<br />
<br />
Or... If you always want the latest version, always go to<br />
http://www.firehose.net/free/nsis/ <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petersa</div><div class="date">24th May 2001, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">What ]CkB[Cowboy means, is that since two official NSIS pages show a different newest version, s/he's wondering if there's a newer version than those.<br />
<br />
He did say what is the newest version, not which. And I don't think anyone would be so stupid as to not be able to figure out the higher number.<br />
<br />
No offense to anyone who can't! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">]CkB[Cowboy</div><div class="date">24th May 2001, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I'm a &quot;he&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Secondly, what I was actually wondering.. I don't know which of those two pages is accurate, or if they both are. I am relatively new to NSIS, and don't know how revisions work.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, ANYONE could make mods to NSIS, post it somewhere, call it an &quot;official&quot; site, and unsuspecting users could be downloading something that isn't in their best interest.<br />
<br />
I wanted to know if the http://www.firehose.net/free/nsis/ is the &quot;official&quot; site for NSIS, because those features look really cool (and very useful to me) .. but I wouldn't want to download something that's not appropriate.<br />
<br />
have you guys used the 1.42 version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Invektus</div><div class="date">24th May 2001, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">yes that is an official site...get the 1.42</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arune</div><div class="date">24th May 2001, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I myself wondered, when I was new, if there really were a newer official version than the one on NSDN. <br />
As English is not my first language I missinterpretated your question, <br />
and of course I thought it was a strange one. <br />
But if you wanted to know whish was the newest official one, <br />
you should have mentioned that in your question...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I´m sorry!<br />
:)</div></div><hr />
