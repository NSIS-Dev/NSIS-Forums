<br />
hope you can help me.<br />
<br />
I am a new NSIS user, and i already googled a lot for my problem:<br />
<br />
During the installation of an programm via NSIS i want to check, whether a special library (mfc90.dll) is already installed. If not the installer for that lib has to be started.<br />
<br />
The second part is no problem, but how can i check, whether the mfc90.dll is already installed? <br />
It can't be as difficult and i can't believe, that this problem is an  &quot;new&quot; one and nobody asked for this before.... so please... is there anyone who can show me, was i couldn't see until now?<br />
<br />
thanks a lot for your help.<br />
<br />

${IfNot} ${FileExists} &quot;$SYSDIR\mfc90.dll&quot;<br />
ExecWait Yourinstaller<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
But this is not a good way to do it. It could be somewhere else in your path, after all. Perhaps this might help? http://forums.techarena*****windows-xp-support/1128484.htm<br />

Ok make that http://forums.techarena. in/windows-xp-support/1128484.htm  Without the space. This forum's autocensoring of some keywords is EXTREMELY ANNOYING.</div></div><hr />
