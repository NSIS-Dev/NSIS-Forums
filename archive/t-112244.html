Hi kichik,<br />
<br />
i'm using the NSIS 1.99. <br />
Due to the faults i've upgradet from 1.98 to 1.99 - but the error still exists.<br />
<br />
See the file (is a zip) including the compiler output, screen shots and the source ..<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

<br />
BTW, you can upload ZIP files here, you don't have to rename them to txt files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't want to have a custom entry.<br />
I just want to have my 3 choices : <br />
- RTI-Server01<br />
- RTI-Server02<br />
- Other<br />
and no COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM - no custom choice - just my 3 choices...<br />
<br />
I've attached a faked screen - as i want to have ...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that's impossible with just NSIS. You will have to use a custom DLL such as ShowWin.dll (latest CVS version only), or create a custom page using IO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm - sorry if i misunderstand the function<br />
InstType /NOCUSTOM  <br />
<br />
If i use the /NOCUSTOM function - (in my mind) i would not have any &quot;custom choice&quot; ... am i right? It doesn't work :hang: <br />
So, what's wrong with my code?<br />
<br />
I would be happy to get the right code.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">1st November 2002, 09:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Your code is perfectly fine and your installer works perfectly fine too. When you use InstType /NOCUSTOM the user can't select Custom from the drop down list and can't change the components selection without the drop box. That's exactly what you have in your installer, what is the problem?<br />
<br />
If you don't want the component selection box to show at all you will have to use ShowWin.dll, System.dll or InstallOptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jacob Metro</div><div class="date">1st November 2002, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if you throw /componentsonlyoncustom together with /nocustom you will see only the three choices you are looking for.<br />
what that'll do is force the compiler not to let you see any components except the three you have outlined seperatly, and you won't be able to choose a custom install.<br />

Hi Jacob,<br />
<br />
this won't work :( <br />
Both parameters in one :<br />
InstType /NOCUSTOM /COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM<br />
<br />
line will force a compiler error : <br />
Usage: InstType (/NOCUSTOM|[LANG=lang_id] /CUSTOMSTRING=CustomStr|Typ<br />
<br />
And each in one line :<br />
InstType /NOCUSTOM<br />
InstType /COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM<br />
<br />
will have the result of 4 choices ... including the unwanted &quot;Custom&quot; :cry: <br />
<br />
Another Idea?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">/NOCUSTOM can't be combined with /COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jacob Metro</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a couple of examples from KiCHiK.  Here are my results.<br />
<br />
Your text should be the following:<br />
<br />
Don't include huge scripts in the message itself. Attached below<br />
<br />
In my case I needed in excess of ten options, I think three is just perfect for this method.<br />
<br />
I have included screen shots in the attached file showing the purpose of using both /NOCUSTOM and /COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM.<br />
<br />
Feel free to email me with any questions.  J.Metro@juno.com.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me put it this way... You can't put InstType /NOCUSTOM and InstType /COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM in the same script. It just doesn't work, you can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jacob Metro</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is what you're looking for.<br />
See attachment<br />
the attachment has my script (lifted from KiCHiK) with both /NOCUSTOM and /COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM thrown.<br />
The attachment also shows the results on my PC.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jacob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Jacob, enough. /NOCUSTOM and /COMPONENTSONLYONCUSTOM can't be in the same script together. They just CAN'T!<br />
Making all of the sections not visible will not work too because it won't show the component page at all.<br />
<br />
Allowing the user to choose only one section should work.</div></div><hr />
