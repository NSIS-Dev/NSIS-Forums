<br />
The option 'SingleSelect' in the EmbeddedLists ListView doesn't seem to work.<br />
I set the option to '1' but still I can select multiple items.<br />
(The same thing happens in the 'ListView_MultiColumnCheckBoxes' demo)<br />
<br />
<br />
Using the latest version (30 March 2010) (Standard version, NOT unicode)<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Would it be possible to make the text for 'Select all / Unselect all' changable?<br />
We have an installer in a different language and we need to change those texts as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Johan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">14th April 2010, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">SingleSelect=1 works fine here.  You may be confused as to what it's purpose is, though?<br />
<br />
Within the Windows UI language, a listbox item being selected means the user has selected the item itself (making it turn blue, etc.).  This is unrelated to the checkbox.  So when SingleSelect=1, it means that the user can't select multiple items using e.g. the Shift or Ctrl key.  But they can still check/uncheck items freely.<br />
<br />
I'm not seeing anything in the EmbeddedLists documentation to allow only a single item to be checked.  You can certainly do this yourself in the Page's Leave function - but there's no callback for when a user checks / unchecks an item to handle this more gracefully.<br />
<br />
That said.. if that's the behavior you want, you probably shouldn't be using a checkbox at all :)  Just set CheckBoxes=0 and the stack in the Leave function will contain the selected item ( i.e. the blue one ;) ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was expecting the same behaviour as from the .NET components we use.<br />
We are forced to use checkboxes. (The customer insists on it)<br />
<br />
The 'blue' selected color is not visible, because we are using it on a 16 color display. (There it just remains white)<br />
<br />
It seems that I have to write my own plug-in that gives me the functions that I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">15th April 2010, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">a custom .NET component might have a radiobutton behavior option for a checkboxes listview - but I don't think the standard one does.<br />
<br />
Also odd that you would not see the blue color on a 16-color display.  It's the same navy blue that Microsoft have used since at least Windows 3.1.<br />
<br />
But regardless.. if the client insists on checkboxes, and you need a radiobutton behavior on them, then yes.. you'll probably have to write your own (or check with Stu on whether he could implement it)</div></div><hr />
