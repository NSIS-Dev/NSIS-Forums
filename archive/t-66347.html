Or, do you want a tweaked version to have?<br />
By them take a look in this Forum!<br />
<br />
First I want to add one by my self.<br />
Please see this (http://softwareforfree.freehosting.net/files/zipexe/nsis) page for my great versions!<br />

But, if you put any requests, other developpers can see what's popular under the public. I won't create this versions by myself!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've visited your project's web page but I can't find any where ther anything about it's added featured. It will be nice to know what it does include before download it.<br />
<br />
I think NSIS homepage should contain a page with links to tweaked, modified, custom (or how the hell you want to call'em) versions, because some people don't mind to increase a bit it's package size if they can use a special feature they were searching for and they didn't found in the original NSIS. In this way tweakers won't have to broken it's head to update its modified NSIS versions.<br />
<br />
Another propose to NSIS team is to include a file in each release where they mention modified files in that release respect previous one.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my english (meal is awaiting for me...)</div></div><hr />
