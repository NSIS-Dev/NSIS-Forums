<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</div><div class="date">30th July 2005, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I have asked this question before but it was ignored since it was in a thread that wasn't on subject.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who can make or find an program that can create a fake partition and load an installer inside of it and moniter all file actions it takes and registry actions.<br />
<br />
I need a kind of... Debugger for installers to see what exactly its doing on my computer.  The previous topic asked if you could extract a source installer file but I'm not asking this.  What I'm asking is if theres a sort of exe shell that can launch a program and create a fake mounted drive of an operating system and hook all commands and log them.<br />
<br />
I know its possible but, I have never seen any such software so far.  Not all installers make log files saying exactly what action they took to install the program or set of programs.  I see tons of program packs, freeware packed together that installs just like the seperate installers but in one foul swoop.<br />
<br />
This question kinda works with nsis and any installer program.  I ask this for multiple reasons, I like want to make a custom codec pack and multiple other things.  I do not want to load each installer from a main installer and go through tons of differant screens to install a pack of codecs or other things.  So I wanted to install them all at once by installing it finding out the installer installed them all and copy that as well as add in more to it.<br />
<br />
I may be off base asking, it may not be possible or insanely easy but... I have not been able to find a way and was hoping someone here could help me out.</div></div><hr />

Any other possible techniques or software hints would be greatly appriciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</div><div class="date">30th July 2005, 12:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Bochs sure is tough to understand... Followed it and it said it couldn't boot from my drive X_X...  I'll try tomorrow i guess :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-=HaXoMaTiC=-</div><div class="date">30th July 2005, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Update: Tried Virtual PC by microsoft and oddly it did exactly what I expected.  BSOD'ed me and screwed up my network settings... I had to fix my PC for a bit...It BsoD'ed on installation of the VPC 2004 trial. I have a Mirror Raid which probably is the reason why it crashed... Stupid windows and its stupid stupidness :(.<br />
<br />
Got any other suggestions for debugging installers besides full OS emulators...?  No person has every thought of the concept of making a debugger that just reads that exe's commands that its set to watch through windows and file calls?<br />
<br />
Bochs looks useable besides the fact that its a hell of a lot of work to do something so simple...or at least a simple need.      <br />
<br />
Bochs works but fails to boot even though i followed the config description... Is there possibly any tutorial sites, or an alternate help site besides his main one?  I didn't find anything helpful.  It seems that program was made for masters, or maybe I'm just slow, lol.</div></div><hr />
