<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fullscreener</div><div class="date">4th May 2004, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all -<br />
<br />
  short version: <br />
<br />
is the firewall handling of NSISdl as good as the firewall handling of a win32 fxn like URLDownload?<br />
<br />
<br />
 longer version:<br />
<br />
  i'm creating a system that will automatically update itself.   I've decided on a simple implemntation -- b/c<br />
 my app isn't big -- it will check a version number &amp; if the version number has expired -- it will load the &quot;latest&quot; installer from a fixed url   /latest.exe<br />
<br />
   What i'm trying to decide now if i should use NSISdl to do the downloading -- its nice b/c its already written w/ nice progress bar, etc. however, i'll be calling the installer from a shell ActiveX control (req. for other functionality) <br />
<br />
  OR i could just write the download functionality into the activeX control  -- use a win32 fxn like URLDownload to download -- displaying my own dialog &amp; progress bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
 and the only reason i'd consider the second approach is if URLDownload does a better job at loading through proxies.    Does anyone know?<br />
<br />
I don't want to ship out my project &amp; later discover that 5% of my users... even 1% of my users can't install my software b/c the proxy/firewall handling in NSISdl isn't as good as URLDownload's or some other win32 fxn.<br />
<br />
Thanks -<br />
Matt</div></div><hr />
