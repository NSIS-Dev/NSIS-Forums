<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">backpacker299</div><div class="date">10th July 2007, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I am developing an installer for a .NET 2.0 application and I am having a very peculiar problem. I can run the application using the same set of files I later package into the installer and the application runs fine. After I package it into the installer and install it on a machine I get mysterious problems, including an unloadable DLL error (for a DLL that is up to date and is in the install directory). Is there anything that anyone can think of that might be causing this? Am I even right to think that the problem could be coming from NSIS?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Nik</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the $INSTDIR created correctly and all files copied intact?<br />
<br />
Did you try to turn off the compression?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All files seem to be copied intact and correctly.<br />
<br />
I didn't know I could turn off compression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it isn't big trouble give it a try without compression, use SetCompress off on top of your script.</div></div><hr />

If you're packaging .NET assemblies, you need to register them using gacutil or another method (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Register_a_managed_.NET_DLL_in_the_GAC).</div></div><hr />
