<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pim42</div><div class="date">5th April 2001, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm new to NSIS.  It is pretty cool. I am trying to make it an installer for an Apache/mySQL/PHP package.  I want the installer to search through a file (httpd.conf) and change certian values to match the installation directory.  My question is can this be done?  I know WriteINIStr can write to files but can you tell it where to write in an already existing file?<br />
<br />
If the searching cannot be done please consider this a request to add that functionality.  This would highly improve NSIS which is already pretty good.<br />
<br />
Ok also when using WriteINIStr I don't want the [] or the equal sign... how can I change this?<br />
<br />
And finally,  are there any other free installer programs?  Nothing against NSIS but I would like to try them all (if there are any!)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

If you want other functionality, you can write your own program and make it execute at the end of the install.  Just set the output path to the temp directory and delete it after its been run.</div></div><hr />
