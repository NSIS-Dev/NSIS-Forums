<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">20th June 2003, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you get a program to run at the end of an installation? Not the kind of program where the finish page ask the user &quot;run...&quot;.<br />
<br />
In other words I have a batch file which is required to run in order to complete some task. It has to run otherwise the project might not work and could offer some trouble.<br />
<br />
How do I get it to with or without the users permission?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any information on this :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">20th June 2003, 22:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure it works but I had a little trouble with your suggestion. Instead I took your idea about ExecWait on this thread http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=139665 and applied it to a section which is called last during installation.<br />
<br />
It so far works so is this wise? Could there be another place which guarentees for it to be called last before the finishpage pops up?<br />
<br />
I believe this is cool but would like to know for sure.<br />
<br />
Thank you Joost</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did create my own section and I placed it as the last section called in the script &quot;right above Function un.onUninstSuccess&quot;. It seems to work as requested and it is now my preferred method in launching applications before the install finishes.<br />
<br />
I hope this is wise.<br />
<br />
Thank you Joost.</div></div><hr />
