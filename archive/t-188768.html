<br />
My actual question is whether anyone has had any luck with makensis on Mac OS X.  I was able to &quot;make makensis&quot; with only a few tweaks to the Makefile and the resulting makensis.exe happily displays the usage command, but it segfaults when processing the plugin DLLs:<br />
<br />
./makensis.exe ./Examples/example1.nsi <br />

Any hints?  Do I have any hope of getting this to work?<br />

Many thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks much for your suggestion.  I am not using Darwine, though; I compiled exehead on Win 2k using mingw and then copied the kit to OS X land, where I compiled makensis using vanilla gcc.<br />
<br />
Edit: Unfortunately, Darwine does not seem like a possibility because I'm stuck on 10.2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The complete POSIX support is still new and needs some testing. We've had many Linux users who reported all results, so there may be a few Mac OS X issues left.<br />
<br />
I recommend you to create a bugreport at the NSIS project page. If possible, create a debug version  to see where it crashes. Also include information about the compiler and version.<br />
<br />
The NSIS developer working on the POSIX support will reply to your report later.</div></div><hr />

It was a few versions ago though... Did you add pthread and libiconv? Can you debug and find out some more information (don't forget to remove -s from LDFLAGS)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for looking into it more deeply.  Does the endian issue come into play when the compiled makensis tries to make sense of the dll files?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />
Keith</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately the GCC compiler for Darwin doesn't seem to support an option to get it to work in little endian mode (like Windows). For earlier versions of Mac OS there was such an option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I buy that, but just 'cause I'm slow: does it seem that the immediate problem I ran into -- segfaulting when trying to load the plugin DLLs -- is that my big endian makensis.exe doesn't play nicely with the little endian DLLs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th August 2004, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is indeed the problem.</div></div><hr />
