<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myra</div><div class="date">14th July 2008, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I am sort of a newbie here, so I would really appreciate some kind of opinions regarding the flash project I am about to build.<br />
<br />
The rules are as follows:<br />
1) When user loads the project for the first time, they will be asked to enter an activation code.<br />
2) That particular activation code will be expired after a month.<br />
3) After that, the user will be asked to get another activation key. The users are allowed to go online to do so.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to develop this? Normally software asked for the activation key when the user installs, but in addition to that, now I need the users to key in new activation keys every month after the software expires. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But here some hints...<br />
Firstly you should find out how &quot;good&quot; your protection should be (what is the chance that someone want to crack it) and what features it should support(copy protection, what happens when the user changes the date,...)<br />
<br />
A simply solution would be a combination of a pool of id's (alphanum) combined with an expire date..<br />
Combinde the id and some validation part (checksum of the id) with the expire Date  (for example in the unix date format...)<br />
Then encrypt it with AES, Blowfish or whatever else your System supports..<br />
The encrypted string as hexcode ist your activation key..<br />
<br />
In your programm decode the key and check the expire date and the if the id is valid.<br />
Also you should save the key (encrypted) and check if is still valid(expired) every time you start the app or some other timeinterval...<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not a particular clever method of copyprotection<br />
but it should give you a starting point  to develope a better one  :-)</div></div><hr />
