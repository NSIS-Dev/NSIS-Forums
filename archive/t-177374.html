<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idioteque</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">If have found a program that uses the NSIS installer.<br />
<br />
Now I want to know what the installer in exactly doing. The installer does not show the progress bar in detail and does not produce a log file. Only a uninstall.dat<br />
<br />
How can I make a already compiled Nsis installer exe force to produce a log of which  files are being copied where and what registery keys are being added .<br />
<br />
And the most important question which files are being registerd.<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idioteque</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">i thought perhaps it's possible to run the installer with a commandline switch that logs or shows the install stuff ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said, that is not possible. If the user interface does not provide a log window, it is not possible to show it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">there are special programs, that log all operations a installer is performing on your machine, to give the possibility to completely uninstall the programs.<br />
search for a program doing this. there's some freeware available at big download-sites.</div></div><hr />
