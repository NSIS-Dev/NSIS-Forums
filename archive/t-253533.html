<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Potz</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having trouble copying files.  I have looked at help from the NSIS User Manual and this forum but it looks like I am doing the right thing.  Here is my code for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
 !define FileCopy<br />
<br />
  <br />
  CopyFiles &quot;$INSTDIR\IWARN.bat&quot; &quot;$DESKTOP&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems your code should work.  But, a few things you might look at:<br />
- Does the user have the ability to write to the desktop?<br />
- Does the file &quot;IWARN.BAT&quot; exist in $INSTDIR?  (you might  want to place a messagebox just before the file copy as a troubleshooting step to make sure $INSTDIR and $DESKTOP are set to where you think they should be.)<br />
<br />
And what is the purpose of having ${FileCopy}?  It doesn't seem to be used in your example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Potz</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I have been moving things around with $INSTDIR and $DESKTOP so that shouldn't be a problem.  I know the file exists and it is writable to desktop.  <br />
<br />
what I am trying to do is move a shortcut from the $INSTDIR and put it on the desktop.  I was trying to figure out how to use the CreateShortCut option but I figured if I already have one I can just have it moved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Rename &quot;$INSTDIR\IWARN.bat&quot; &quot;$DESKTOP\IWARN.bat&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the docs, CopyFiles shouldn't need you to specify a destination file name (just the folder).  Have I missed something?<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Potz</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok it works now.  I guess when I had the files unzip there were other folders made and I didn't realize it.  Thanks for your help. you are right about not having to specify a destination file name.  But I think you can if you want to rename it.</div></div><hr />
