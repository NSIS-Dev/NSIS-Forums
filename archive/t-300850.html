<br />
I have a script here that I am using for some time now and it's working good, until earlier today. When I checked, the source of the problem is in our Anti-virus configuration. Our antivirus server has uploaded new policies that prevent execution of files (including DLLs) from the Temp folder.<br />
<br />
I have no rights to disable that policy so now, I can't execute the installer that I have created. This is because the antivirus blocks the execution of system.dll from temp folder (See the attachment for the antivirus logs).<br />
<br />
I don't think I have any control on where the system.dll (and other NSIS related files) is extracted during the initialization of the installer, or do I have?<br />
<br />
If so, can you help me on that?<br />
<br />
Thanks and more power to NSIS!<br />
<br />

<br />
Maybe this will work.<br />
<br />
I really don't like the idea on what they are doing with the policies of that AV. I don't have any control with regards to this AV thing. It's a company policy.<br />
Honestly, I'd prefer avast rather than mcafee but I don't have a choice here.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll post the result here once I got one.<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The alternative didn't work. But I guess the reason is, I still haven't converted all the dll calls to CallInstDLL in all of the files including all the includes.<br />
<br />
But guess what! They've removed/rolled-back the policy just today. After I've worked on this for almost 2 days! Maybe the AV server admin got sued by other people that has the same problems like me. 'bout time...<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again! I'll just save all the resources I've got here in case the policy is once again implemented.<br />

I think this one can be useful.</div></div><hr />
