<br />
    I've got about 800MB of files that need to be installed, so I am using LZMA Solid compression to keep the installer down to an astounding 53MB.  However, I am showing a custom page right after the components page that prompts the user for a username and password, depending on the selections they make on the components page.  It seems that NSIS extracts and uncompresses all 800MB of files into the Windows temp directory right after the components page, before my custom page appears.  Depending on the speed of the system, this can take up to 5 minutes and is confusing for the end-user; it appears the installer has just stopped responding.  Is there a way I can tell NSIS to wait on the decompression until after the custom page?  I've tried using standard LZMA (non-solid) and that works fine, but the size goes up to 150MB.  I've attached my script incase it's needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />

Look at Reserve Files in the help file for the Modern UI because you'll also want !insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_INSTALLOPTIONS.</div></div><hr />
