well it's amazing what one could do with NSIS. Perhaps you'd like to take a look on an alter use of NSIS bellow. Actually is a video launcher (could be used as autorun in a DVD compilation). OK it has not the nice gui expected from multimedia applications but is simple easy and uses mplayer so there is not need to check (and install) to the target system for multimedia codecs as mplayer has its own built in.</div></div><hr />

Talking about DVD compilation it ment to be a DVD containing 6 movies of any video supported by mplayer.<br />
Following the above, there is another use of NSIS to create a video browser (we may call it a single gui for mplayer). The gui resides in the same dir where mplayer is on a local system and helps users to browse and launch for video.<br />
Any comments and suggestions from NSIS gurus to improve the look and feel as well the functionality of these pieces of soft would be welcome. Regards</div></div><hr />
