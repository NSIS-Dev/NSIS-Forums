<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eries</div><div class="date">13th October 2001, 21:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We've been using NSIS with great success at our company for a while now. We've also customized the code quite a bit. Since new versions are coming out every other hour, we thought it might be useful for us and for everybody else to submit our patches back into the main distribution. What is the right way to go about this? Who should I email/contact? <br />
<br />
The main features we've developed enable all kinds of target system detection (OS, hardware, driver versions, etc.) as well as a few other tweaks.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just curious what the next step is...<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the past I've been a bit picky about what gets in, but I think I'll start letting more in, but making it disabled by default (i.e. have a NSIS_CONFIG_WHATEVER for many additions - I'm trying to keep the default EXE header size down =). <br />

We'll give each feature a #define toggle which is off by default. You can enable the ones you feel are appropriate.</div></div><hr />
