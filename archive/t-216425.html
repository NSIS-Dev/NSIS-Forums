<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mahldcat</div><div class="date">19th May 2005, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently researching if I want to continue working with the current installer for a project that I'm part of (custom C# app), or go with NSIS.  <br />
<br />
I have a two fold question.  Is there any support for calling managed DLLS (e.g. something written in C#)?  The systems that I am planning to install to will have the 1.1 framework installed by default, so I don't have to worry about that element.<br />
<br />
Secondly barring this, is there any modules/functions available that would allow me to call a SOAP based web service (or even better any code that will support deploying RDL files to a SQL Server Reporting Services application?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If a non-managed application can call exported DLL functions from a managed DLL, you can call functions from it using the System plug-in or write your managed DLL as a NSIS plug-in. If non-managed applications can't use managed DLLs, you can call a wrapper executable using Exec, ExecWait or the nsExec plug-in.<br />
<br />
As for SOAP modules, I haven't heard of anything like that for NSIS.</div></div><hr />
