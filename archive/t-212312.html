<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 00:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, we have a little problem here<br />
<br />
we have a loader on a portable medium which starts a 3rd party program with parameters<br />
while starting 3rd party we want to have a banner &quot;please wait&quot;<br />
starting 3rd party takes some time depending on hardware<br />
<br />
so i thought findwindow &amp; intcmp will do - negativ - it hangs waiting although the name of the class is correct<br />
(did it before with some other app successfully - but app has to be closed - so i know how to find the window class)<br />
<br />
findwindow &amp; iswindow will wait such long as 3rd party is not startet. in case it is started banner will immeadately disappear before 3rd party has already build its gui.<br />
<br />
3rd party has no indicator when its ready. we want to check if a window with a specific window class or window name is *shown or in memory<br />
<br />
pls help us.</div></div><hr />
