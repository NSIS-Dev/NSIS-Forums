<br />
I have got the task in our firm to find an installer for us. There are many products and I have not found satisfying information on home pages so I would like to ask you for filling in the table (Word) I am sending you. The table contains functions the installer that we will choose should have. I hope the filling this table in will not take you much time. If your product is freeware I will still be more grateful. If your product is commercial I can ensure you that if we choose your product we will like to buy it. <br />
<br />
Please excuse me if I have contacted you already.<br />
<br />
Best regards, <br />
<br />
Karel Maèl, firm CCA, Pilsen, Czech Republic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">9th March 2005, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at your list and read all your points...<br />
<br />
Operating system support (what it runs during packing)<br />
?<br />
<br />
Operating system support (what it runs during installation)<br />
?<br />
<br />
parameter installation  (to ask user during installation, e.g. in what directory to install)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
installation packing according to choice of appropriate configuration file (there will be one configuration file for each our product, that is possibility to create a set of configuration files and then only to choose according to which file the installation shall be made)<br />
This should be possible<br />
<br />
possibility of configuration file editation „by hand“ (e.g. in Notepad)<br />
NSIS script language is pure text<br />
<br />
limits (possible limits of installation volume, number of files, etc.) {our distribution has approximately hundreds MB}<br />
2GB limit (due to Win 9x)<br />
<br />
mask support (asterisk convention- when I want to copy e.g. files *.dll and I need not name them)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
support of directory recursive processing (when I want e.g. to copy the directory APL and everything that the directory contains)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
possibility to start external programs – e.g. sqlplus (synchronic (installation stops and waits for the completing of external programs) and asynchronic (it does not wait for completing of programs))<br />
Yes; Exec, ExecShell, ExecWait, nsExec plugin etc<br />
<br />
creation of user dialogues (these are various reports and communication)<br />
Yes; InstallOptions plugin<br />
<br />
possibility of different reaction of product installation according to some parameters (customer, installated version) – e.g. to install various files according to a customer code<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
possibility to delete files during installation (also files that are not part of installation – e.g. from the previous version of the product (application))<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
protocol creation of installation course (log file from installation)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
protocol creation of distribution packing (report from distribution packing)<br />
This will be possible, but you’d need to create some custom function to do it (on compile-time)<br />
<br />
e-mail and Internet support (e.g. to send a log file from installation)<br />
You can use FTPPlugin<br />
<br />
installation dividing in more parts if installation is longer than medium type (CD, DVD, www; the fixed file length)<br />
Would have to be done manually<br />
<br />
file control during installation writing (if the older/ newer file name is the same, detection/possibility of reaction in the case of file locking (when the file is open), setting of file attributes, …)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
summer/winter time support (possibility to ignore one hour difference between the files)<br />
More info?<br />
<br />
Possibility of install away (to return to the state before the installation was done when there is a installation mistake, that is to delete the result of installation, but to restore the original state)<br />
No built-in support, but this is possible<br />
<br />
Possibility to change the user interface (colours and logo of our firm)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
support of long file names<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
support of Czech spelling in file and directory names<br />
Not sure, but it should work<br />
<br />
to fix big and small letters in file and directory names (we will be interested in it mainly during distribution of Java programs)<br />
If you mean to convert file names to lower case, then yes<br />
<br />
possibility to functional enlarge (existence of inner programming language?)<br />
That’s the main feature of NSIS… It’s a programming language in its own right<br />
<br />
native archive support (ability to pack/unpack common archives without external archive maker) – ARJ, RAR, CAB, ZIP, etc.<br />
Not built in; command-line utility would have to be used<br />
<br />
possibility to start installation at the customer’s from instruction line (+ possibility to pass parameters on from instruction line)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
ability to create self – startable CD (creation of installation and files that will start installation automatically after having been written in CD)<br />
Do manually by creating an autorun.ini file<br />
<br />
support of work with registers Windows<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
possibility to read information from files on disk during installation (e.g. for control of installed product version according to records in files .ini)<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
control of installation consistence (CRC?), best of all immediately after installation starts (installation should be stopped immediately at the beginning if there is a mistake in writing in CD or in medium etc.)<br />
Yes; default behaviour<br />
<br />
possibility to create self – unpacking file with suffix *.exe (secondary, primary e.g. setup.exe and packed data should be separately)<br />
As default, files are packed inside the setup.exe, but if stored outside; again you’d have to use a command-line utility to decompress them<br />
