  I need some help. I wrote an application with VC++ and made a NSIS installer to install my app on the same PC for test (vista os). I meet two problems:<br />
  1. My application created by VC++ can run in vista correctly. But the installed application can not run without admin right. I have to run it as admin. I donâ€™t know what happened for my application in the installer. I just copy files from EXECDIR to INSTDIR.<br />
  2. If I have to run my installed application with admin right, how can I tag run as admin automatically?  If I create shortcut, what should I do for this purpose?</div></div><hr />
