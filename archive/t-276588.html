<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartins</div><div class="date">28th August 2007, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to create a custom uninstall page or form similar to this one:<br />
http://www.thornsoft.com/Misc/trialpay_uninstall.PNG<br />
<br />
The design does not need to be exactly like that and could even be integrated in the uninstall dialog but I would like it to be the first page to be displayed when the user runs the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
Anyone knows if this is even possible with NSIS? I have sample code for inno setup (to create that exact dialog) but I use NSIS in all my products.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

It's very easy to do as you can use Visual Studio to design your form. The only bit that may require a little bit more work is changing the background colours.<br />

What about displaying that text within the uninstall dialog as the first page the user would see? Would that be an easy thing to do?<br />
<br />
I only use Delphi so I'm not sure it would be easy for me to write the plug-in to display the dialog (but I can try :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">28th August 2007, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a Delphi example under ExDll (in NSIS source under Contrib). ExDll may be included with normal NSIS dist. now as well but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, yes, using InstallOptions or nsDialogs will let you create an embedded dialog in your installer/uninstaller but you cannot change the dialog's size. There are lots of InstallOptions examples in the Examples and Examples\Modern UI folders. nsDialogs should have some as well.<br />
