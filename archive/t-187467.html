<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Instructor</div><div class="date">22nd July 2004, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Nullsoft Install System is the best. But when I had been writing<br />
one script I could not do some string operations. I started to try<br />
various functions, but unfortunately they were narrowly - directed and<br />
some of them hanged during testing it I think inadmissible.<br />
<br />
 For this reason I wanted to write universal function on which other<br />
functions can be based and wrote &quot;WordFind&quot;.<br />
<br />
  Recently I have finished creation of a header file which includes<br />
the following functions (with many examples):<br />
<br />
 1. WordFind (un.WordFind)<br />
 2. WordReplace (un.WordReplace)<br />
 3. WordAdd (un.WordAdd)<br />
 4. WordFind2X (un.WordFind2X)<br />
 5. StrFilter (un.StrFilter)<br />
 6. CopyToClipboard (un.CopyToClipboard)<br />
 7. CopyFromClipboard (un.CopyFromClipboard)<br />
<br />
I shall be grateful if you will estimate the done job. :)</div></div><hr />

E.g.<br />
!macro StrStr TheString SearchFor<br />

 Push ${SearchFor}<br />
  Call StrStr<br />
!macroend<br />

In their script, one would use:<br />

I was thinking to awnser before you about updating StrFunc.nsh.<br />
<br />
@Instructor<br />
<br />
1) They have uninstall.<br />
2) Doesn't matter what you use the most. Sometimes neither I use it. It's only a selection of functions. I was thinking on your header file to make some changes to StrFunc.<br />
<br />
I'll say more at night, 'cause right now I don't have time to awnser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Instructor</div><div class="date">24th July 2004, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize, if is valid StrFunc has uninstall macros (I have only the version included in NSIS 2.0).<br />
<br />
For new version of WordFunc.zip (http://www.Shengalts.narod*****files/WordFunc.zip)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">25th July 2004, 01:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It's giving a foreign language 404 html error...<br />
<br />
Now this is the time...:<br />
<br />
You did a great job on doing all that. I really should stop my vacation on the StrFunc development now.<br />
<br />
I see that you have some ideas on the header file itself:<br />
<br />
- !define _UN1 when using uninstaller functions.<br />
<br />
One thing to improve here is that you could make a smaller header file using this below as an example:<br />
<br />
!macro un.CommandCall Parameters<br />
  !define _UN1<br />
  !insertmacro CommandCall ${Parameters}<br />
  !undef _UN1<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
!macro CommandCall Parameters<br />
<br />
  # A normal command call<br />
<br />
!macroend- It doesn't have a command to separate commands for install and uninstall functions. Makes more lines of code (inside header file), but makes easier for the user.<br />
<br />
And I did test your functions, they are in great shape, but we need to make sure that it doesn't have any bugs. Using that program of yours it will be much easier.<br />
<br />
Now a list of planned things for StrFunc.nsh 1.07:<br />
<br />
- I'll examinate your first 5 functions in your header file for bugs, if they have, I'll call you here. If not, they'll be included.<br />
- Did you see my first suggestion here? StrFunc has a problem like it. I should fix it.<br />
- An example program like yours (kichik told me before to do a different example program than just a simple test).<br />
<br />
Because I already promissed the InstallOptionsEx new version soon, I'll start working on StrFunc only after that plugin launchment.<br />
<br />
Ok, that's all for now. See you soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Instructor</div><div class="date">25th July 2004, 13:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand your code.<br />
<br />
  &quot;!define _UN1&quot; (_UN1 is already defined)<br />
<br />
 Do you mean:<br />
<br />
!macro un.CommandCall Parameters<br />
  !undef _UN1<br />
  !define _UN1 `un.`<br />
  !insertmacro CommandCall ${Parameters}<br />
  !undef _UN1<br />
  !define _UN1<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
!macro CommandCall Parameters<br />
  Push ...<br />
  Push ...<br />
  Call {_UN1}Command<br />
  Pop ...<br />
  Pop ...<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
If yes, then the size on the contrary will increase.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">25th July 2004, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it should be:<br />

macro un.CommandCall Parameters<br />
  !define _UN1 `un.`<br />
  !insertmacro CommandCall ${Parameters}<br />
  !undef _UN1<br />

<br />
This is simple, because _UN1 will start off undefined, be defined for the CommandCall, and then be undefined again (for another CommandCall)<br />

Because I already have one function totally for this subject.<br />
<br />
And another thing, you could add an ability to filter the characters the user wants. But you don't need to do this right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to have some of your functions in the better shape as possible for the people (as I said before). You don't imagine how tested the functions that are included with StrFunc.nsh within NSIS are. As NSIS is in a stable version, we test everything we can...<br />
<br />
I know, you've done a good job, but we need it to be a &quot;perfect&quot; job. As I had to do before. So that's why I'm asking more favors from you now:<br />
<br />
- General:<br />
<br />
  - Don't try to compress every option and, for example, words to add under one parameter, try to expand it into several parameters so makes the input more organized (for the user).<br />
  <br />
  - Try to make an error handler like NSIS do, it never outputs like a parameter, but it uses the command &quot;SetErrors&quot;. Only in much complicated matters is used another return value for errors (like InstallOptions).<br />
  <br />
  - Try to make it accept the String without separators. That means &quot;String&quot; should have the minimum of 1 word (not 2 as now it is).<br />
  <br />
  - Make output parameters as the first, then the input ones.<br />
  <br />
  - As all the functions are ${WordFind} dependant, you could make them with more options, like the ${WordFind} itself.<br />
<br />
  - Learn to use default values for the parameters, like in ${WordAdd} the &quot;Delimiter&quot; parameter could have a value when it is empty.<br />
<br />
Don't be mad at me just by that, when I started nor even English I did understand well, now after about two years using NSIS (I'm member here since Dec, 2002, but I used NSIS since Aug, 2002) I have two projects that I'm working right now, and other several functions, but most of them I kept abandoned.<br />
<br />
(Sometimes you can see me as a perfectionist, that's because I'm an user and a developer at the same time.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Instructor</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">... make a smaller version of StrFilter without the Upper case and Lower case options. Because I already have one function totally for this subject.<br />
<br />
I think there is no necessity to change idea of function and the more to reduce an opportunity.<br />
<br />
<br />
And another thing, you could add an ability to filter the characters the user wants.<br />
<br />
The concrete example is necessary for me (What string is given? What it is necessary to make?).<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to have some of your functions in the better shape as possible for the people...<br />
<br />
Do you mean comments?<br />
<br />
<br />
- Don't try to compress every option and, for example, words to add under one parameter, try to expand it into several parameters so makes the input more organized (for the user).<br />
<br />
How many people are so much and opinions. I see it as have made (simple, organized, compact).<br />
<br />
<br />
- Try to make an error handler like NSIS do, it never outputs like a parameter, but it uses the command &quot;SetErrors&quot;. Only in much complicated matters is used another return value for errors (like InstallOptions).<br />
<br />
It is simple to do. The offer: SetErrors for errorlevel 1-4.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Try to make it accept the String without separators.<br />
<br />
What sense? What tasks can be solved thus?<br />
<br />
<br />
That means &quot;String&quot; should have the minimum of 1 word (not 2 as now it is).<br />
<br />
There is minimum = 1 word + delimiter ([Word][delimiter], but not [word])<br />
<br />
<br />
- Make output parameters as the first, then the input ones.<br />
<br />
If it is critical that I can change it. Though it is more habitual for me by analogy to use of functions:<br />
   <br />
   Push &quot;...&quot;<br />
   Push &quot;...&quot;<br />
   Call Function<br />
   Pop $var1<br />
   Pop $var2<br />
   <br />
<br />

<br />
- Learn to use default values for the parameters, like in ${WordAdd} the &quot;Delimiter&quot; parameter could have a value when it is empty.<br />
<br />
All values required I don't want to change it (There are no those parameters which it is possible to name by default).<br />
<br />
I in any case do not become angry. I am glad, that there are people which express the opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

Sorry has not closely read.<br />
<br />
I have thought that you have suggested to add besides errorlevel parameter also command SetErrors.<br />

I want to tell, that errorlevel serves for the greater concrete definition of mistakes (you are itself understand it) which it is possible and it is necessary to use (Examle.nsi).</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... I was saying about the function StrFilter. That's because it now has an option to choose between letters, numbers and other types, but it doesn't accept the characters you want.<br />

<br />
String: &quot;C:\Program Files&quot;<br />
<br />
Filter: &quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Result: &quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
...I was saying about the functions.<br />
<br />
1) What opportunities in functions does not suffice?<br />
2) Globally: what operations with string, it is impossible to do, but it would be desirable?<br />
<br />
<br />
Could you include at least this change...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I can't, as this change already exists. :)<br />
You even can enter no words, but a delimiter should be found necessarily (accepted: string from one delimiters).<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are going to test functions, you can enter any parameters and strings - functions will not hang and will show result (at least so reflected).<br />
<br />
Pay attention on (WordFind):<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Strings:<br />
&quot;[word+1][delimiter][word+2][delimiter][word+3]...&quot;<br />
&quot;[delimiter][word+1][delimiter][word+2][delimiter]...&quot;<br />
&quot;[delimiter][delimiter][word+1][delimiter][delimiter][delimiter]...&quot;<br />
&quot;...[word-3][delimiter][word-2][delimiter][word-1]&quot;<br />
&quot;...[delimiter][word-2][delimiter][word-1][delimiter]&quot;<br />
&quot;...[delimiter][delimiter][word-1][delimiter][delimiter][delimiter]&quot;<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way has a little changed WordFind:</div></div><hr />
