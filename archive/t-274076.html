I'm completely new @ this installer stuff but I noticed while I was installing Gordian Knot Codec Pack that only NSIS was able to make an install that contains even more installs within. Well I have a whole bunch of my own programs (over 100) and I was wondering how do I make this? All of them have  their own install already so all I need is an installer to join all of them together (and than individually install them with their own installs that they already have of course) just like the install in Gordian Knot Codec Pack. I hope I told you accurately enough what I need if you don't understand please let me know!<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that you can help,<br />

File is a basic nsis instruction to include/compress files.<br />
$PLUGINSDIR is a constant which represents a temporary directory used by your installer.<br />
ExecWait is a command that tells nsis to execute an executable and wait until it finished.</div></div><hr />
