  I am a newbie windows developer and I have created this program and I am using the NSIS installer (tight by the way thanks).  Any way I want to associate a mime type with my application so that when you download a file from my website with the new mime-type it will automatically launch my program.  Is this something I do in the installer and if so does any one have a sample or suggestion where to look?  If it is not in the installer and in my C++ code then I am open for suggestions on that too.  <br />
Thank you in advance for answers.<br />
<br />

What they did was create their own protocal. It was in a dll. I don't know what they did, but it is hard to explain. But NSIS doesn't support this. I hope to soon do something like AddLineToText text_document &quot;line_of_text&quot; , but now, it is only possible to create a plug-in for IE or Netscape/Mozilla. <br />
<br />
Sorry,<br />

E.g. (if you have the acrobat pdf plugin for ie), search the registry for application/pdf and see how it is implemented.<br />
I do think it would be easier to write your own 'helper' nsis dll, which you call with rundll32.exe. Also, I am not sure how Netscape handles new MIME types.<br />
<br />
Or, you could just associate a filetype; then, as happens on winamp skins, when the user is prompted to download, they click &quot;Open File from current location&quot; or whatever and that is it.</div></div><hr />
