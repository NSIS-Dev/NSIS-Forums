<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SunToo</div><div class="date">11th December 2007, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
is there any way to automatically add the size of the uninstaller to the &quot;Space required&quot; on the directory page? I know I can use AddSize to do it manually. But I have to run each new installer before to get the size and than I have to compile it again with the modified size. That's circumstantially and sometimes I already forgot this adaption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th December 2007, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You can generate the uninstaller at compile time, check for its size and use that for AddSize.<br />
<br />

<br />
But that should be done automatically. Submit a feature request for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SunToo</div><div class="date">11th December 2007, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Yes, that's a solution. Thanks. But to tell the truth it's not my favorite, because it doubles compile time which is often already long (especially if you compile different editions of a product).<br />
<br />
According your solution I had another idea: I could write the uninstaller to the TEMP directory on the destination system before the directory page is displayed, check the size, add it with SectionSetSize and delete the file again.<br />
<br />
Its a workaround too but saves compile time.<br />
<br />
2) In this context I have another question: The installer writes a lot of temporary files by default and may write some additional files depending on the script. I think the size of this files is not considered during calculation of the required space, although it should. Is that correct?</div></div><hr />
