<br />
During the installation I need to run a little program. There are 2 problems:<br />
1, Need to run program silently<br />
2. Program starts with the message box with the question like &quot;Do you really want to strat this program?&quot; and buttons &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;<br />
<br />
Please let me know if it is possible to run it silently and how to do this.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

( there are some alternatives, essentially 'clicking' the Yes button via code, but they're not recommended. )</div></div><hr />
