2. i was trying to find a documentation for the dialog pages, as i can't make out what 107 is used for. it looks almost exactly like the directory page, but that one uses 103 - and then what is that checkbox for in 103, i don't recall any use for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe i start with what i did so far and what i'm trying to achieve.<br />
<br />
1. i have added a branding image to dialog 105 (based on default.exe), which you can see in the attached screenshot. it's all working perfectly, but of course this interface is unsuitable for certain pages (components, license.)<br />
<br />
2. i have moved the same branding image from dialog 105 to the details dialog. i had in mind the actual details would only be displayed with the button hit and the details dialogue would overlap the entire branding image. that way i could easily leave the branding image for the components or licence page. however, though the syntax is 100% the same as above, makensis would not compile my script (Error: no branding image found in chosen UI!) i have no idea why that is!<br />
<br />
when i wrote the initial post, i suspected the use of a branding image in multiple dialogs would cause the problem. now i know it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">10th January 2011, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">btw, the scripting reference mentions SetBrandingImage won't work in .onInit, but i had to use a custom function because .onGUIInit isn't working either. maybe worth mentioning in the docs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZmAn3</div><div class="date">11th January 2011, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">the branding image only works if your using the modern ui plus even then  you have to have the script call at least one MUI page even if you dont use it -I think<br />
<br />
you can reshack in your own control and use set branding image for that control<br />
look at  http://zman3.deviantart.com/#/d35w0u3 for an example<br />
<br />
or if you want to post your script as well as any bmps and edited uis you may be using i'll take a look</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's exactly what i did, but i only get it to work in dialog 105<br />
<br />
i can post a dummy script when i get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">10th March 2011, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">i still don't get this: i have a bitmap resource in dialog 105 and i can change it as desired. when i move the same bitmap from 105 to any child dialog, SetBrandingImage will no longer work.<br />
<br />
again, what i'm trying to do is have a brandingimage in some dialogs (components, dirpager, instpage), but not in others (license page). how is mui dealing with this, apparently only the welcome/finish pages are using an image. i haven't found anything in the mui.exe or the include files, how is it done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">10th March 2011, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">By using nsDialogs (finish/welcome pages are made with nsDialogs). If you want to add an image to the installer pages, add it with resource hacker and then set the bitmaps using the nsDialogs macros.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">10th March 2011, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">the most important question is still unanswered and an answer could provide the simplest solution. is it not possible to add a branding image to any other dialog but 105? if so, shouldn't it be mentioned in the docs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">10th March 2011, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">You are welcome to add a note via a patch. This isn't something people usually do... A 'branding' image is for the entire installer (AddBrandingImage is a compile time instruction / installer attribute) and so that is how it has been coded no doubt. You could submit a feature request.<br />
