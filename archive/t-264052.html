<br />
If this is any easier, this is what has been discussed between our group. We don't want to lose valuable internet traffic, so is it possible to write an installer program that does the following.<br />
<br />
User downloads installer program, again, nothing to &quot;install&quot; as such inside this. User downloads individual packages or modules inside zip files from our site, and drops these into the main installer folder. The installer, when run, knows where to look for these using environment variables \Packages, and the user clicks install and boom, the packages they have downloaded are run silently then the original zips are deleted from the system.<br />
<br />
Or, the user can run this wrapper program and browse for an individual package, which the wrapper then installs. The wrapper then deletes the original package file.<br />
<br />
This can be repeated again for different packages they download.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing is, the installer &quot;wrapper&quot; must be able to recognise packages dynamically, will ifFileExists cover that??<br />
<br />
I'll have a read up about that function tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
