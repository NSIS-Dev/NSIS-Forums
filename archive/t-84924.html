I think that the NSIS Wizard should have the same style as all modern Windows wizards. Like other installers (Windows Installer, InstallShield, InnoSetup): <br />

As a reply to http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=84300<br />
<br />
I made a new define, which goes in config.h <br />
<br />
#ifdef NSIS_CONFIG_CRC_SUPPORT <br />
// NSIS_CONFIG_CRC_WHOLEFILE enables support for detecting a filesize that is greater than the original installer (pomflain) <br />
#define NSIS_CONFIG_CRC_WHOLEFILE <br />
#endif <br />
<br />
Here's the before and after, it's from Main.c line 244. <br />
Just need to add the block that I've marked, but I included the other lines so you can see exactly where it goes. <br />
<br />
#endif//NSIS_CONFIG_VISIBLE_SUPPORT <br />
<br />
if (left&lt;m_length) crc=CRC32(crc, temp, l); <br />
<br />
#endif//NSIS_CONFIG_CRC_SUPPORT <br />
m_pos+=l; <br />
left -= l; <br />
} <br />
<br />
#ifdef NSIS_CONFIG_CRC_WHOLEFILE <br />
/*CRC32 Whole file fix 17/4/2002 (pomflain)*/ <br />
if((m_length - 4) != m_pos) <br />
{ <br />
m_Err=g_crcinvalid; <br />
goto end; <br />
} <br />
/*CRC32 Whole file fix end 17/4/2002 (pomflain)*/ <br />
#endif <br />
<br />
#ifdef NSIS_CONFIG_VISIBLE_SUPPORT <br />
#ifdef NSIS_CONFIG_CRC_SUPPORT <br />
if (hwnd) DestroyWindow(hwnd);</div></div><hr />

Please insert the new commands for section selection as I did it for Nsis 1.95. I can migrate it to any newer release, if it helps! <br />

There you'll find the sources and the description. The binary version <br />

Yeah, my own wish!<br />
<br />
While surfing the Forum, I encountered some feature request of mine of the past, which I thought would be a nice addition to NSIS 2.0.<br />

My wish is that the CRC checksum will be done after all of the installer was written to the disk so that its resources can be edited. Currently the CRC checksum is done after almost every change to the installer. <br />
If this could be done then XP style support adding could be done at compilation time of the NSIS script, unneeded resources could be stripped down to shrink the installer even more, and support for icons with more than 16 could be implemented very easily. <br />
<br />
If justin doesn't want to do this, I will find some time in the near future to do it myself as I think it could add a lot. <br />
<br />
Addition<br />
Just a couple more thingies to the wish: <br />
<br />
If this will be done it will also be easier to impelement multi-language support as resources and other settings could also converted to resources instead of compile time #define's. <br />

You can process the EXE header before it gets written using !packhdr. :) If you want to run multiple commands, use a batch file...<br />

<br />
The wishlist idea is not working out. A lot of people don't seem to be able to find this place to report bugs. And I don't want to move posts around everytime and risk crossposting. So this is no longer a sticky, because when people do not use it, it's just useless!<br />
<br />
I hesitated a lot to do this because some people use it with good intention, but when other people do not use it, bug reports still are scattered around the Forum and then the central place has no use. I have warned several guys by replying (example (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=86029)) to the bug report, but obviously, not all people saw this.<br />
<br />
No hard feelings, I just do not want to mess up the Forum with useless posts!<br />
<br />
Have fun, greetz,<br />
