SectionIn RO doesn't work and the SectionSetFlags doesn't work either. I know that this probably should be automated so that if all Sections in SectionGroup are read only, then the group checkbox also appear as read only, but it doesn't seem to be so.<br />

Is there anything I can do about this?<br />
<br />
I attached the scripts as well, but it is very complex and I doubt that anyone actually bothers to check the scripts out. I will write a simpler script with same method later.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ok the SectionSetFlags seems to work after all, but why SectionIn RO doesn't work for SectionGroups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">27th April 2006, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I know that SectionGroups aren't just meant to be read only. Read only SectionGroup would require a new checkbox state (read only partially selected) and there are no such checkbox in the check bitmaps. I attached a script what demonstrate the problem (note that all the SectionGroups are set to read only in the script).<br />
<br />
So there really isn't much anyone can do about this problem.</div></div><hr />
