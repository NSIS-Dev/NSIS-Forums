<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">13th April 2004, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the first I wanna say is:<br />
<br />
NSIS is great!<br />
<br />
I tried Install Shield and any other Programs before, but nothing satisfied me like NSIS <br />
<br />
the 2nd thing: My English is bad, don't worry about it<br />
<br />
ok, now the most important thing of this post<br />
<br />
There is an Error in the Command WriteRegStr...<br />
<br />
I Wrote a Program which needs a Password depending on the Database, so I used a var to write the Password in the registry. So far so good - executing the Setup it writes the<br />
key_name in the subkey, but no value - if I change the key_name it writes the value<br />
:igor: I don't know what NSIS doesn't like on PWD as key_name, because it accepts PWX or PWA or anything like this... hope anyone can help me to get this f*cking PWD in the Registry<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />
<br />

^^Thanks :D I didn't expect that ;) <br />
<br />
ok, it looks like this:<br />
<br />
.<br />
.  (other stuff)<br />
.<br />
var PWD<br />
.<br />
.  (other vars, sections and stuff like that)<br />
.<br />
StrCpy &quot;$PWD&quot; &quot;JW463;&quot;<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\MyProg&quot; &quot;PWD&quot; &quot;$PWD&quot;<br />
.<br />
.  (other stuff)<br />
.<br />
<br />
first I thought it happened because of the ';' but without this it didn't work, too.<br />
<br />
then I tried other values for $PWD but there was no result<br />
<br />
then I just changed &quot;PWD&quot; to &quot;PWE&quot; and it worked fine...<br />
<br />
sombody could think it would be easier to change &quot;PWD&quot; but there are a few Customers I would have to update, because all of them have a PWD Field in the registry<br />
<br />
if there are still open questions, you can also write a mail or a PM<br />
<br />
come on don't be shy ;)<br />
<br />
Hope this wasn't too bad english</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">14th April 2004, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I tried it with another script again<br />
<br />
and it worked... :igor: <br />
<br />
I copied the few lines into my other script and it still didn't...<br />
<br />
I don't know whats going on there<br />
<br />
I had an error like this with another script, I tried and tried but it didn't work after a reinstallation of NSIS it worked<br />
<br />
am I stupid or are there known errors like this?<br />
<br />
*throwing the PC through the window*<br />
much better<br />
<br />
now in serious, which I make wrongly?<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I have the Error:<br />
<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\My Prog&quot; &quot;PWD&quot; &quot;$c_PWD&quot;<br />
^^doesn't work<br />
<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM Software\MyProg &quot;PWD&quot; &quot;$c_PWD&quot;<br />
^^works fine<br />
<br />
But there is the problem that I have to use THIS sub_key...<br />
It seems to be a &quot;bug&quot; in NSIS - hope anyone has an Idea how to fix it</div></div><hr />

If you think it's a NSIS bug, please create a script that reproduces the problem and submit a bug report at the project page.</div></div><hr />
