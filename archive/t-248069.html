<br />
I have just discovered NSIS yesterday, and since then, I have been working a lot with it, reading all the documentation, FAQ, etc... I have to confess that I love what you guys made of this tool ! It's great !<br />
Only one thing that bothers me... and I have now been looking everywhere for a possible answer for that, without any success... :-(<br />
Here is the thing: I have a text file in which all the files I would like to package are listed.<br />
I would like to know if it is possible to read this text file and include these files to the package.<br />
I have been trying to do that for hours... I would really appreciate any help.<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />

It will read from your text file (using FileOpen, FileRead and FileClose) and generate NSIS code which you later !include in your main script...<br />
