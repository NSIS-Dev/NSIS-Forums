<br />
we're very happy users of superpimp! Our build system runs on a linux host, so a Linux/UNIX/*IX version of superpimp would make a full automation of our build process possible.<br />
<br />
Are there any chances to get makensis ported? Any plans? Success stories?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
Erich</div></div><hr />

So I think this would be possible without too much difficulty,  but I haven't looked through every little detail of the source,  just the portions that I wanted to modify.<br />
<br />
So give the source a look,  it may be easier than you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I will give you a couple of reasons why it might not happen.<br />
<br />
1) Since everything &quot;X&quot; is distributed in a type TAR file (e.g. .tar.gz, .tar.bz, .tgz) and with the source, you would need a thing like the Redhat Package Manager (RPM) to run on all distros and be able to handle the users personal preferences for installations.<br />
<br />
2) There are 2 different NSIS &quot;versions.&quot; The regular with zlib and the other with bzip2. With that there would have to be 2 different &quot;managers&quot; that would decompress and compile.<br />
<br />
It would just be wiser to include a install shell script that would do all of the actions so that linux users can install it with out having to use the console.<br />

Obviously, my post was ambiguous...<br />
<br />
I meant a version that runs on UNIX systems and still produces installers for Windows systems.<br />
<br />
It's clear to me, that you never want to deal with the bunch of UNIX installers...<br />
<br />
Sorry,<br />

I see where you are coming from, and yes, it would be nice to have a NSIS installer that runs on a UNIX platform, but again, it might not be able to happen. Just try to port it and then see what happens. Or, just use WINE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">You might can run NSIS under wine to install windows programs.  But you will never be able to use it to install unix programs.  Its pure win32 code.  There's no easy way to port that to unix.  Plus, the installation of unix programs is so totally different from windows programs, that functionally it isnt possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">6th April 2002, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no reason why you cannot port makensis to UNIX, as long as you either:<br />
i. Copy and paste the exe head from the supplied win32 version of makensis, bin2h it, and copy the resulting header to your UNIX system or<br />
ii. Compile the exehead on windows and again, copy across.<br />
<br />
I had a quick look through the makensis source, and there are a few things you will need to change, but they are mainly little things like bmp verification.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">6th April 2002, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ... I don't know I thought this was free as in speech ware :p . Just port it and we will see :).<br />
