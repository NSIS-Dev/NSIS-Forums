<br />
Short of naming an Admin uninstaller 'uninsta.exe' and a User uninstaller something else, and querying if the file exists, is there a way NSIS could be made to read who installed, a User or an Admin?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to do that? A variable, similar to $INSTDIR, which gets passed to the uninstaller, that would return the account type of whoever installed the software? Or some other method?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnicer</div><div class="date">23rd April 2010, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. Or rename the uninstaller. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

No variables are EVER passed to the uninstaller. Not even $INSTDIR. As you can find in the manual: &quot;in uninstaller code, $INSTDIR contains the directory where the uninstaller lies.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnicer</div><div class="date">25th April 2010, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The help file just says $INSTDIR may be a different location in the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
Hate to quibble, but that's all it says. You can take from that, that the variable is not passed to the uninstaller, which of course it isn't.<br />
<br />
Why can't variables be passed to the uninstaller?<br />
<br />
I think Yathosho said it, nsis doesn't need that. I agree -- why argue?</div></div><hr />

Hate to quibble, but that's all it says.If you look at the manual again, you will see that you are wrong about this. From http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.2.2<br />
<br />
&quot;Note that in uninstaller code, $INSTDIR contains the directory where the uninstaller lies. It does not necessarily contain the same value it contained in the installer. For example, if you write the uninstaller to $WINDIR and the user doesn't move it, $INSTDIR will be $WINDIR in the uninstaller. If you write the uninstaller to another location, you should keep the installer's $INSTDIR in the registry or an alternative storing facility and read it in the uninstaller.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnicer</div><div class="date">25th April 2010, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You actually can move it and $INSTDIR will change; I didn't know that. Now I do. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
On reflection, I also think, it might not be the safest if you could pass variables to the uninstaller. Like, if you pass the installer account type as standard user and you make a mistake, the account type is really admin. The safest place for that info is the registry, which can't err. I was wrong.</div></div><hr />
