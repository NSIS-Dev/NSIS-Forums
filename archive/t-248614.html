<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">H. Kim</div><div class="date">13th June 2006, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a error message.<br />
<br />
File: &quot;Resource.svs&quot; [compress]Error: add_db_data() - compress() failed(input/output error [-4])<br />
<br />
condition was<br />
SetCompressor lzma<br />
The file size of Resource.svs was 1.9GB.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to figure out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BashLogic</div><div class="date">13th June 2006, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">dont know whether you could exceed that figure, <br />
its common to have the 2gb limit at least with some binaries on some systems..try packaging the data separatly and call it from your nsis installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">13th June 2006, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I always try to compare using bytes, because then it gives me an &quot;exact&quot; value to work from. Two files may be 2MB, but one has 2094152 bytes, and the other has 2111152 bytes. <br />
<br />
If there are any other big files in the installer, then it will give a compress error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hello1024</div><div class="date">7th January 2007, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry to bring back this old topic, but has anyone had any success with large files.  I'm trying to use the LZMA compressor to compress a 10 GB file, but I know most of the file is empty space and it will compress down to 600MB.<br />
<br />
Problem is I've started it compressing, and 8 hours later it's still going, with no indication of how long it will take.  It seems it's trying to load the entire file into memory, and therefore the system is doing a lot of swapping, and I think it's going very slowly.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I tried using the zli compressor, and whenever I give it a file igger then 705MB, it seems to just truncate it - I'll report ack the exact size that it truncates to when I get there.<br />
<br />
PS.  No guesses which key on my keyoard isn't working!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hello1024</div><div class="date">11th January 2007, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
have you any ideas when you might be planning to implement large files support - are we talking months, years, or never?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th January 2007, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">No idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">superchi</div><div class="date">21st May 2010, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a while. Anyway we can support large files (&gt; 2GB) within the installation package?  Accepting donations to support this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">21st May 2010, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">You can add a Feature Request in sourceforge project (if there is not already one for this).<br />
<br />
With the release of a Unicode version of NSIS coming close (which, when enabled, will require target computer to have Windows 2000 or more recent), maybe we can start adding features to NSIS that could not be added previously because they required Windows 2000 and NSIS had to be compatible with every Windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">21st May 2010, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Note that you can be using Windows 2000 or XP, and have a hard drive formatted as FAT32 which still limits file size to 2 GB<br />
What should NSIS do in this case?!<br />
As a general rule, if you plan your application to be used on various systems, you should not use files that are &gt; 2GB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">21st May 2010, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed.. even a very large software vendor (Autodesk) splits their full downloadable installers into 2GB chunks of a self-extracting archive, which extracts to the actual installer(s) + support / data files.<br />
For regular ol' media (DVD, Blu-Ray, USB) you typically wouldn't bother packing all the files into the installer either.. far too inefficient.</div></div><hr />
