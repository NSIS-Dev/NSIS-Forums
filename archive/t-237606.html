Quick question - is there any way to stop the utterly stupid behaviour of HM Soft's (otherwise excellent) editor regarding deleting a GUI element. <br />
<br />
The problem is that when an element is deleted, the field number for every other element is then changed. This is clearly stupid, as then everything in the installer that references these other objects now breaks or misfires. Ridiculous!<br />
<br />
Any ways round it? There are lots of items on this page, as it has tickboxes for whether software is detected, so precise interation regarding which software is present is crucial.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhaelochon</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it must renumber the fields, because InstallOptions iterates through them in a &quot;1 to n&quot; fashion, where n is equal to the NumFields key in the INI. I believe you'll find other InstallOptions page creators exhibit the same behavior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th February 2006, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it'd be a good idea to have the editor generate a header file, like MSVC's resource.h, that will include defines that link identifiers to real names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">10th February 2006, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be a much more elegant thing to do, yes. The UI editor is almost unusable for altering a screen (like the one I use) with multiple elements that the installer needs to refer to to update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">10th February 2006, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">One workaround for Rob is to not delete the element- instead convert it to a label (so it can't grab tab focus) and position it offscreen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">10th February 2006, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">hah...that sounds enough like a hack that I like it :) Good answer!</div></div><hr />
