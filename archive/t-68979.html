<br />
Normally instsrv.exe is used to install a service, but some vers of OS dont come with the utility.<br />
So at the mo im including instsrv with my installer, extracting it, installing the service and then deleting instsrv.<br />
<br />
Is there a better way to install a service?</div></div><hr />

Have a look at the code sample in the last post of this (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=66211) thread. <br />

The service is the DriverLINX Port95NT driver for direct access to IO ports under NT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">18th December 2001, 06:10</div></div><div class="posttext">What you could do is check to see if they have the file using IfFileExists and the using nsisdl.dll to download it. Then running it. But sometimes the Startup folder in the Start Menu can run anything on Boot.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion though.<br />

<br />
I found it in my search for a similar solution.<br />
<br />
Any news on this since then?<br />
<br />
(otherwise I will have to do what the OP did:  include instsrv with my installer, extract it, install the service and then delete instsrv)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Thank you! I knew that some progress must have been made since 2001.<br />
<br />
However, I noticed that you said &quot;my own internal utilities&quot;. Does that mean that the license for this utility (which is available only in Microsoft's resource kit) doesn't allow its re-distribution?<br />

Thank you again - I didn't know about these. I found two relevant plugins:<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Simple_Service_Plugin <br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Services_plug-in <br />
<br />
Both seem to allow re-distribution in a commercial (non open source) product.<br />
<br />
Which of the two would you recommend?</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure how the MS licesne is written.  It's probably in some license agreement you click on when you install.  (I've never used it for anything other than my own testing tools, so I've never really looked that close at the license.)<br />

I've not really used either, so I can't really offer any good feedback.  I'm guessing they probably both work much the same. I'd look over the docs for each and see which one give you the most of what you need.</div></div><hr />

This is incredible - I didn't know about this list. Thank you so much, kichik!<br />

If your recommendation is different than Stu's, please write it here. Thank you again.</div></div><hr />
