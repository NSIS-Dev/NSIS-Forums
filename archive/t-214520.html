<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ilya31</div><div class="date">30th April 2005, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the maximum amount of characters that I can write to the Temp file that that was created for me using GetTempFileName command? Here is the code that I wrote to write HTML code to the temp file. When I run my program the HTML page is created, but at some point the text that I write to the file is getting cut off and does not show up in the wcab_forms.html. So I am guessing I hit the limit to the amount of characters that I can write to the file. How can I increase the limit?  Thank you.   <br />
<br />
<br />
GetTempFileName $R1 &quot;$INSTDIR\Version 1.2&quot;<br />
ClearErrors<br />
FileOpen $8 $R1 &quot;w&quot;<br />
FileWrite $8 &quot;some HTML code&quot;<br />
FileClose $8<br />
Rename $R1 &quot;$INSTDIR\Version 1.2\wcab_forms.html&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ilya31</div><div class="date">30th April 2005, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, it is still kind of short. I guess I would need to build the web page outside of the installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">30th April 2005, 01:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The GetTempFileName Function should only return the name of a file, but should have no bearing on what gets created within the file itself. (In fact, I think you'll find that it's the FileOpen command that actually creates the file, not the GetTempFileName function.)<br />
<br />
I'd say your problem is likely that you are trying to write too many charcaters at once.  You may need to write to the file with several FileWrite commands strung together.<br />
<br />
(I'm not sure what the actual limit is, but since FileRead can only deal with 1024 characters, I'd guess that FileWrite is probably the same.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ilya31</div><div class="date">1st May 2005, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I will try your suggestion. I will use several FileWrite commands instead of one. For the FileOpen command I would need to use append (FileOpen $8 $R1 &quot;a&quot;), right? So the contents of my 1st FileWrite command would not be erased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">2nd May 2005, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You dont need to open and close the file between writes.<br />
Ex:<br />
<br />
FileOpen x abcd<br />
FileWrite x yy<br />
FileWrite x zz<br />
FileClose x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 09:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Incidentally if you want to use append, you also have to stick the filepointer at the end of the file:<br />
<br />
<br />
FileOpen $0 &quot;filename&quot; a<br />
FileSeek $0 &quot;0&quot; end<br />
FileWrite $0 &quot;stuff&quot;<br />
FileClose $0</div></div><hr />
