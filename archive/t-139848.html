<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ScottO</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a simple NSIS script that finds the location of a .mdb file via the registry and overwrites it with a newer Access db.  That portion works great and this is my first foray into NSIS, and I found it rather easy to use and learn, which brings me to my question: I want the install.exe file to be deleted on my clients' computer after a successful install.  I would like this to work regardless of the location of the install.exe file...<br />
<br />
Any help is much appreciated...<br />

<br />
I realize that is the command to use, but how do I specify that I want to delete the executable install file???  Delete /REBOOTOK OutFile is what I thought, but alas that does not delete the file...</div></div><hr />

Remove quotes and command line parameters from it and you're good to go.</div></div><hr />
