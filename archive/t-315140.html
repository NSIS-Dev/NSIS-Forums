<br />
I want to uninstall an old version of my software before install new one. Everything works fine. But I run the uninstall in Silent mode to avoid that the user can skip the uninstall. <br />
Now my question, is there a plugin or another way to show a small &quot;task&quot; window with a progressbar and the information about uninstalling so the user will see that something is going on? Most common &quot;Setup solutions&quot; have this I hope it is possible with NSIS, too.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ocrana</div></div><hr />

<br />
(From an NSIS perspective, obviously. Technically everything is possible in software, but yeah.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ocrana</div><div class="date">6th December 2009, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Why it should not be possible? A marquee progressbar do not need any additional information but show the user that something is going on.<br />
Iam just wondering that there are only two possible ways: Silent without any info and normal where the user can interact and stop the uninstall.</div></div><hr />

Why it should not be possible? <br />
Because, as far as I know, there are no functions in standard NSIS uninstallers for requesting the uninstallation progress from an external process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was able to create this behavior in my (un)installers by handling myself programmatically (in NSIS script) a command-line option /SHOWPROGRESS that would skip pages automatically (calling Abort in &quot;PRE&quot; functions)</div></div><hr />

Except that this would only work for new uninstallers. I think he wants to get progress numbers from an *existing* uninstaller. That would only be possible by hacking into the running process somehow, or hacking into the executable before it's executed.<br />
<br />
Edit: In which case it'd be better to copy the uninstall code to the new installer and call it as a function when required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">7th December 2009, 10:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Then one solution would be to display yourself a fake infinite progressbar (I hate those...) while the uninstaller is doing its job silently<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ocrana</div><div class="date">7th December 2009, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Wizou, Iam wondering why you hate this. The main problem is, my uninstaller will stop a service, uninstall a driver and the files. This will need some time. I prefer a &quot;fake&quot; window instead of &quot;No Responding&quot; window cause the uninstaller runs in exec wait.<br />
<br />
I will try to make a solution. For the first &quot;hack&quot; the &quot;Pre&quot; idea is good. But I hate Buttons that I cannot click ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">7th December 2009, 12:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer knowing how much I will have to wait ;-)<br />
but if it's not possible, you're right, it's better to see a fake window (hence my suggestion)</div></div><hr />

There are various banner plugins that you can use for this purpose.</div></div><hr />
