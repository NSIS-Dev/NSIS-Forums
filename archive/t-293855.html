<br />
If the user goofed up, and forgot to pass in enough parameters, I would like to return an error, rather than read too far on the stack, and corrupt things...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">1st July 2008, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Plug-ins use the NSIS stack so if you keep calling popstring until it returns 0 then you've got everything. The problem there is if there were already items on the stack before the plug-in call then you will read those as well. Therefore if you are using a non fixed amount of plug-in arguments then you should require the last argument to be /end so you know when you have to stop popping off the stack.<br />
