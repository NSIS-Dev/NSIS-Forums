<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peterfrisch</div><div class="date">14th December 2010, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I know there are quite some threads already about the jre detection topic, but I seem to have a different problem. I just installed java (jre6 update 22) on a brand new (virtual) win7 64Bit machine and was quite puzzled that there was no registry entry in the usual HKLM\Software\JavaSoft place telling me the current version and the javaHome path ... Also there was no PATH variable set, so my install script assumed there was no jre installed at all and tried to do so again (and gracefully failed ...).<br />
<br />
Do I miss something obvious here? Is it no longer called java but jOracle or something like that? Is it somewhere else these days? Do I have to specify some options to make the silent install add the PATH variable? Is there a brand new way to figure out, where java is installed that I'm not aware of?<br />
<br />
Any help is cordially appreciated.</div></div><hr />
