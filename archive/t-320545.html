<br />
I'm trying to make a install files using NSIS. <br />
And I wondered that If instfiles page could show a web page.<br />
(I am using MUI-interface)<br />
<br />
so, I found the nsWeb plugin, but that seems to be work well in custom pages only. <br />
maybe thread problem I think, is there anyway to do for me? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your answer! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">5th July 2010, 07:38</div></div><div class="posttext">You would need to create a plugin for this. The closest thing that I know of is the nsisSlideshow plugin, which was created a few weeks ago: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=319946  Perhaps you can use that as a base..?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">5th July 2010, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">just to throw a curveball out there.. keep in mind that you don't actually need to use the InstFiles page to install files.  You -can- use 'File' and such outside of Sections just fine, and use the section flag reading bits to decide which code sections to execute, if needed.</div></div><hr />

And there are more questions about it.<br />
<br />
1. I want to show a web page at the install time (as I said above ..)<br />
   But, in my case of using nsWeb plugin, <br />
   I could't show the web page and execute install sections simultaneously. <br />
   Once I used nsWeb in a Function(or Section), it just stopped.<br />
   It only show the web page and just waiting the user's input.  <br />
   And, it continues after the clicking the button 'Next'.<br />
<br />
2. If there are appropriate solutions about it, <br />
   next step is displaying a progress bar as the instfiles page.  <br />
   I couldn't find the way of inserting a progress bar yet. <br />
<br />
3. Alternatively, is it possible to show a flash instead of showing web pages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">6th July 2010, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">1. If nsWeb locks code execution, then that might be a problem.  A timer (NSD_CreateTimer) -might- be able to circumvent that, but I'm not sure how useful that would be.<br />
<br />
2. A progressbar is easily created with nsDialogs as well - just check the documentation.<br />
<br />
3. I don't think so, although perhaps it would be possible to insert a flash player control into a dialog.  What happens if you embed a Flash object in the webpage being displayed with nsWeb?</div></div><hr />
