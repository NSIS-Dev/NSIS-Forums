<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noleander</div><div class="date">9th March 2005, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  I'm working on a software package (music synthesizer) for Windows, and we are currently using Vise as an installer.  Vise has some real shortcomings, and we've heard good things about NSIS, so we think we will switch to NSIS.   We need to make 100% sure NSIS will work before we invest the time to switch, so we have two questions:<br />
<br />
1) Our package, compressed, is about 4 GB (includes a _huge_ data file) and is delivered on a DVD. A single file is 3 GB.    Can NSIS support files &gt; 2 GB? <br />
<br />
2) Our users frequently install thru shortcuts for installation.  In other words, the customer will have (already existing) a directory path like:<br />
  C:\Program Files\Music\PlugIns\Delays<br />
where the &quot;PlugIns&quot; folder is a shortcut TO A FOLDER ON ANOTHER VOLUME.     Can NSIS install into (through) shortcuts like that?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help,<br />

<br />
As for shortcuts, you'd have to find it's target (there's likely an API call which will do the trick which can be called with the System plugin).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">10th March 2005, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">For shortcuts use should use IShellLink interface (-&gt;GetPath()), might be better to write a short plug-in (or search archive :) ), this is not a big problem.<br />
BTW NSIS supports not only single-file distribution, but multi-files mode as well. You can put many files to DVD - this also should work faster. Decompression support presents.</div></div><hr />
