<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyakite</div><div class="date">15th November 2005, 08:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I have no idea, but the Search feature has come up with absolutely NOTHING when I search for: MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN.  Even if I search for &quot;MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN&quot; and *MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN* it comes up with nothing, and I've been looking through threads that use the exact phrase.  Bizarre.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN set, and set the text etc.  However my finish page gives reboot options also.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get the &quot;Reboot Now&quot; and &quot;Reboot Later&quot; options to show AND show the &quot;Run program&quot; checkbox as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th November 2005, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the search engine has a limit on the word limit. Try MUI_FINI* or something similar.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as to your question, it doesn't make any sense to show a run program checkbox along with the reboot options. Requiring a reboot usually means the program can't run until the computer is rebooted. And when rebooting, it makes no sense to run the program because it'll either close right away or not even start.<br />
<br />
But, if you really want to do this, you can always edit the Finish page INI page in its pre callback function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyakite</div><div class="date">16th November 2005, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand the logic behind that, however you might want to schedule a program that runs on startup all the time.<br />
<br />
So the checkbox could say &quot;Run program at startup&quot;, and the MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_FUNTION or whatever could set the Registry RunOnce variable so that the program runs on next startup.<br />
<br />
I just think the checkbox would be a much cleaner option than having a message box come up asking the user.  Plus there is plenty of room on the reboot page, under both options to have the checkbox there.<br />
<br />
I'll take a look at editing the finish page ini though.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Persoanlly, I don't think the finish page will look good and simple with both a check box and a radio button set. But that's just me.</div></div><hr />
