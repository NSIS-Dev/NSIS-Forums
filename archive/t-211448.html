<br />
Just a quick question as I'm caught in the mud.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm that they managed to make makensis run under freebsd?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure whether I should give up on making it work and move to a linux based machine instead or whether its worth spending more time trying to make it work :)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
I've simply been unable to build it and getting it to run. I'm in no way expert on bsd-systems though and I might be doing something terribly wrong.<br />
<br />
However -- I have had a couple of guys familar with bsd systems looking at it as well and they have also been out of luck. <br />
<br />
Maybe its simply the documentation thats too implicit regarding pre-requisites etc. for any of us to have any luck with it. (or maybe we are simply too stupid :-) (which probably is more likely).<br />
<br />
Have no problems getting it working on linux based systems. We might just compile it on linux and then run it in linux compatibility mode on the bsd box :)<br />
<br />
Anyway - I just wondered if anyone else managed to build it on bsd :)<br />
<br />
