<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roodysenecal</div><div class="date">26th January 2005, 07:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an Access runtime I want to install, but I want to make sure the user does not have access before installing the runtime. I try using SearchPath, GetFullPathName but none seem to work. I can get IfFileExits to word, but I must know the path. Can this be done better maybe using ReadRegStr, something that will let me know the version of Aceess if it does exits.<br />
<br />
Function accessfullpath<br />
        SearchPath $2 &quot;msaccess.exe&quot;<br />
        GetFullPathName $3 &quot;msaccess.exe&quot;<br />
        ;messagebox MB_OK &quot;access path: $2&quot;<br />
        DetailPrint &quot;NSIS is installed at: $2&quot;<br />
        DetailPrint &quot;NSIS is installed at: $3&quot;<br />
        IfFileExists &quot;C:\program files\microsoft office\office11\msaccess.exe&quot; 0 +2<br />
        MessageBox MB_OK &quot;access is installed&quot;<br />
<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

GetFullPathName converts paths to short, or vise-versa (ie C:\Program Files =&gt; C:\Progra~1 in short)<br />
<br />
Search your local registry to find a suitable registry key.<br />
Microsoft Office until now as far as I know is always installed in $PROGRAMFILES\Microsoft Office because the installers never let you install anywhere else!<br />
But still, searching for a file or folder is never a very good solution because you could always have duplicate file or folder names on a system.<br />
