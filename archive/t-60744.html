<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hongsj</div><div class="date">24th September 2001, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont like to leave installer on user's hdd.<br />
cause it's some kind of private contents.<br />
<br />
I think it's possible, but it's too difficult and dizy stuff to me.<br />
(make copy to temp, run that, delete orginal leave xxx.bat del all)<br />
<br />
but i wish, future or other release of NSIS have<br />
a password protection or self-destruction. :)<br />

Here's a possible technique you can use to workaround:<br />
<br />
First prepare a &quot;Self-Destruct&quot; temporary NSIS program.  Write a script that starts by reading from a specific spot in the registry, this will be the location of your installer.  Then tell it to delete the string you just read.<br />
<br />
In your real installer, write the installer directory and name to the registry in the main section of your script.  Include the pre-compiled &quot;Self-Destruct&quot; installer in your script and extract it to temp, then run it at the end of your script.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hongsj</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 02:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot, Gonzoek.<br />
probably, my head will be overheat, today :)<br />
<br />
also thanks, Repzion.<br />
but maybe it can possible by installer in installer,<br />
or making something like batch file to delete installer,<br />
or combination of both.<br />
<br />
welcome any new idea<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Here try this:<br />
<br />
After the Installer is created ...<br />
<br />
Section Uninstall<br />
;Uninstaller stuff<br />
Section end<br />
<br />
Section -post<br />
;post install<br />
Section End<br />
<br />
Function .onInstSuccess<br />
     Delete $EXEDIR\exeinstaller.exe<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
-Duane<br />
P.s. Windows DOES have a way for EXEs to delete them selves or an Uninstaller (Not the NSIS uninstallers) wouldn't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm agree, but unfortunately that was not worked.<br />
and finally I made 3 seperate nsi.<br />
#1 for extract #2 &amp; #3 to temp dir and excute #3,<br />
#2 for pure installing my apps &amp;<br />
#3 for excute #2 and delete #1 &amp; #2.<br />
(#3 remains in temp dir. (but I dont care.))<br />
It's really dirty way :D<br />
<br />
grateful to all of you<br />
