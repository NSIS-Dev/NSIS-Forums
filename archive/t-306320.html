<br />
I am including a very important message box in my installer, and I would be sure that the user red the message before clicking &quot;OK&quot;. <br />
<br />
I configured the default button on &quot;Cancel&quot;, but I think it's not enought. <br />
<br />
The better would be to disable the &quot;OK&quot; button, sleep the installer during few seconds end then, enable it. <br />
<br />
But I can't find how to access to the &quot;OK&quot; button of a messageBox with GetDlgItem, do you have an idea ?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">14th May 2009, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">it might be possible..somehow, but NSIS code execution basically 'halts' as soon as the messagebox pops up - so there's no easy way to disable any button on it afterward.<br />
<br />
some of the banner plugins might be what you need, or a custom dialog, or (Anders would know), maybe you can do what you need with the subclassing plugin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">14th May 2009, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">to do this, you would probably need a hook + subclassing, see http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/dMsgBox.aspx and to do this you probably need to write a plugin because I don't think the system plugin can do hooks.<br />
<br />
Its probably possible to do this with just my subclass plugin by waiting for WM_ACTIVATE, but that would be a bit fragile if the user switched to another app just before your MessageBox<br />
<br />
There is already a messagebox plugin, but I don't know if it supports a wait feature, but you might want to check that out first</div></div><hr />
