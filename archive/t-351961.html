You are supposed register your application/file type in the documented way, the user will then pick their desired default.<br />
<br />
The FileExts key was added as a layer on top of that and only explorer is supposed to touch it. The UserChoice key was added later and defines the default progid. In Win8 the security of this key was changed, probably because people could not keep their fingers away from it.</div></div><hr />

No messing with these keys is not going. ;)  Write a program with a fixed file associations.<br />
How to do this using NSIS?<br />
<br />
This registry key is protected<br />
I asked a specific question - how to remove this protection?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have write access to all keys under HKCU, the policy key(s) etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are not supposed to touch the UserChoice key, use the documented keys, they don't require special access...</div></div><hr />

People will use this information for evil, it is better for Windows users everywhere if it stays a secret...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stass</div><div class="date">14th November 2012, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand ... But why not help the user NSIS, setting he needed associations? For example, to make a plugin for the file associations in windows 8. Can it be a secret?  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
See the MSDN links I posted, this is all the information you need to register a file type...</div></div><hr />
