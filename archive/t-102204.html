<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Alpha 7 is not officially out yet. If you want to get pre-alpha 7 use the CVS to download it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david33470</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">i try to go on the link below your message and to go on the cvs link but i don't realy understand how to use cvs. there is an executable file like other version or i have to download all file one by one????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no installer yet. You can go to SourceForge's &quot;browse cvs&quot; feature and download the files one by one, or you can do it the easy way with a CVS client such as TortoiseCVS (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48103&amp;release_id=105667).<br />
Once you have installed TortoiseCVS (it uses NSIS :D ) just right click on the folder you wish to download pre-alpha 7 to and choose &quot;CVS Checkout&quot;. Fill in the details as they are filled in the screen shot I attached and you will have a directory called NSIS created with the latest CVS version. Right-click it and choose &quot;CVS Udate&quot; to update it to the latest version when it comes.<br />
<br />
Pay attention only to the edit boxes in the screen shot. The top list is just a history list, you shouldn't care about it for this.<br />
<br />
The top edit box fills up by itself. Just fill all of the edit boxes below it and it should show exactly what's on the screen shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
May be you could setup something like cvs-snapshot service (acting for example once a day), so we'll be able to download the latest version in one tgz/zip file?</div></div><hr />

Please note that makensis.exe is not generally up-to-date.  You will need to rebuild this if you want the really up-to-date source.</div></div><hr />
