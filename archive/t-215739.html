<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brainsucker</div><div class="date">11th May 2005, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I've created a simple 7z unpacker plugin, takes 7z archive name, unpacks to current dir (based on 7z console sfx but all console stuf ripped). Almost no size optimizations since my 7z package size is about 27 meters, so some kbs doesnt matter at all. So 140 kb .dll, large enough, but anyway feel free contact me if you need it (also i've managed to decrease installer size from 40 to 35 mbs using pure 7z compression, may be due to 32 mb dictionary). <br />
<br />
So that 27 mb package is something like &quot;merge module&quot;, since it never changes, and we are packaging different releases of our product. But when we create setup, we need to pack 20+ mb of data, so compression couldn't be turned off. So we are repacking 27 mb 7z ultra compression archive with nsis-7z-compression. dude. Any thoughts about introducing unpacked data sections to installers?<br />
<br />
Also... Some time ago I've mentioned file @lists and installer compressing progress... It would be very nice to see such features in official NSIS release :) <br />
<br />
Anyway, thanx for that great piece of soft :) gl, NSIS :) :p</div></div><hr />

However, for non-solid compression, SetCompress works perfectly well. In version 2.06, you have to recompile NSIS with no NSIS_LZMA_COMPRESS_WHOLE. In the latest CVS version, you can simply use SetCompressor without the /SOLID switch.</div></div><hr />
