<br />
I'm wanting to create an NSIS installer that also installs a dependent application. Both the dependent application and the application using NSIS as it's installer have same options etc. <br />
<br />
I would like to control the other installer from my NSIS installer. So, ideally when the other installer is run from NSIS installer, fields are populated by NSIS so the user doesn't have to re-select options that have already been selected in NSIS installer.<br />
<br />
Can this be done? :igor: <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MHK</div><div class="date">25th June 2008, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">may be this will work<br />
create temp text file some where, and copy all field values into this file<br />
then when the other installer start make it read from the temp text file<br />
<br />
try it and tell me if it work! because I didn't make it before <br />
;) <br />
<br />
but I guess there is a better solution we don't know!</div></div><hr />

Probably, there is another solution to it , try using InstallAware to make installation in which you have an option to merge an existing installer with your present project with an ease.</div></div><hr />
