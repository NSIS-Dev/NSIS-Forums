<br />
First, i'd like to precise i'm looking for a solution for a week now, reading forum and wiki, even looking at VLC installer script. I might missed something.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is my problem :<br />
<br />
I have two file types (i.e two extensions *.ext1 and *.ext2)<br />
<br />
for ext1 :<br />
<br />
if user wants to associate ext1 with the app<br />
{<br />
  associate .ext1 to icon1.ico<br />
  add first menu entry as default (appearing in bold)<br />
  add second menu entry<br />
}<br />
else<br />
{<br />
  add first menu entry as non default<br />
  add second menu entry<br />
}<br />
<br />
for ext2 :<br />
<br />
if user wants to associate ext2 with the app<br />
{<br />
  associate .ext2 to icon2.ico<br />
  add a menu entry as default (appearing in bold)<br />
}<br />
else<br />
{<br />
  add a menu entry as non default<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
I almost succeeded doing this, but i'm afraid i'm messing up registry keys (i just cant put the finger on how it works internally)<br />
Using registerExtension macro doesn't seem to give me enough possibilities (concerning icon and menu entries stuff)<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to make this ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your attention</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have the script with me now, but i'll attach it as soon as possible<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irakleio</div><div class="date">10th July 2009, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my script (attached file)<br />
<br />
This version only does stuff if user checked the corresponding section, which doesn't fit my requirements (i also want to do something particular if a section is unchecked)<br />
<br />
Also, i'm afraid i should do some extra-code to make this work on Vista.<br />
<br />
SEC031 works properly, but SEC032 doesn't. The only difference i see is that SEC032 extension is already associated with application on my comp<br />
<br />
any help would be very much appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Edit : i just realized i may not use the LogicLib you mentionned</div></div><hr />
