<br />
Is it somehow possible to terminate the thread created by ExecDos::exec when the user clicks on the cancel button? <br />
<br />
I am using ExecDos::exec to run a perl script that installs some packages from CPAN and displays the progress from console in a multi-line text window. Since the installation can take several minutes, I would like to give the user the opportunity to stop the installation. <br />
<br />
I can disable next, back and cancel buttons, but weird things happen also when I use the 'x' in the corner of the installer to close it (and I think that some users might try that if all the other buttons are disabled).<br />
<br />
I was also thinking about creating a separate installer for the CPAN packages installation, is there any other function that respects the cancel button? (I've looked at nsExec documentation but haven't found anything useful yet)<br />
<br />
Thank you for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Is that a good idea? Also why isn't the X button disabled? You're not running your script in a section? This is generally bad practice - the machine should not be touched in any way until the sections are executed. If that is unavoidable the X button can also be disabled (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=322433).<br />

Your Perl script will carry on regardless. You could have some UI for your Perl script with a cancel button on it but I realise that isn't pretty. There isn't really any other way.<br />
