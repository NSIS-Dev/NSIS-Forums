<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hungryOrb</div><div class="date">29th February 2008, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo.<br />
I'm working on creating an installer which simply installs some files, creates some lnk's and writes some registry. However, I haven't really learnt a programming language before, and although this is only a scripting language I'm getting a little overwhelmed working my way through it.<br />
<br />
I've had a look at a bunch of sample scripts and have copied and edited what I have thought to do using the Eclipse plugin and Script wizard, but still the actual structure of the installer I think is still a little vague, I was wondering if someone could point me to a friendly resource, or perhaps offer a small explanation as to the NSIS system and its major parameters for simple installers..?<br />
<br />
TIA if any help. :]</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply, I think I've already read the basic tutorials. The problem is they are very basic, and there doesn't seem to be any intermediate ones :)<br />

Kaos, cool your jets or get a GF (if you already have one, I'd suggest she isn't the 'one')</div></div><hr />
