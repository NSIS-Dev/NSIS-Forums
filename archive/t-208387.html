I need to know how to find out if the user has mysql 4.1 installed on there machine.  If it is indeed installed then I do not want to show that section on the install, but if it isnt, then I would like to show that section as required.<br />
<br />
2.  I need to create a new database on the MYSQL server that was either just installed, or previously installed.<br />
<br />
3.  I need to execute 10 .SQL files that will affect the database that was just created.  These files put in tables and values and such.<br />
<br />
That is about it for now I belive, but I will post again later If I need something else.  Im sorry if this sounded alittle upfront and demanding, but I have a headache and have been searching for a while.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance everybody!!  :D <br />

To hide a section set the sections text to &quot;&quot; using SectionSetText. You must also unselect that section using the UnselectSection macro in !include Sections.nsh<br />

<br />
Exec C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 4.1\bin\mysql.exe &lt; &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\Hess Smith\Desktop\SFR\installer\sam2\sql\tables.sql&quot;<br />
<br />
It doesnt work.  Any ideas??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">22nd February 2005, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Exec only accepts one parameter. You're passing it 6. You need quotes around the whole lot:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfinator853</div><div class="date">22nd February 2005, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">OK that worked.  The data didn't save I'm guessing because it didn't know what database to put it in.  Now what I need is to depict what database (schema in Mysql Admin) it is to create that in.  I dont know if I also need to say my database login details in their as well...but ya.<br />
<br />
Later on in the process of making my installer I am going to have to make a custom page for them to enter their mysql login details and that kinda stuff.<br />
<br />
Any and all help would be appreciated!<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
