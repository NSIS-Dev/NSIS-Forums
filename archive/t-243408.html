<br />
Can't get NSIS to copy 3 files that are added into the <br />
EXE file at time of compile.<br />
<br />
File &quot;Mapifix.exe&quot;<br />
File &quot;ETSTempfix.exe&quot;<br />
File &quot;ETS Temp fix.bat&quot;<br />
CopyFiles &quot;$EXEDIR\ETSTempFix.exe&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\ETSTempfix.exe&quot;<br />
CopyFiles &quot;$EXEDIR\Mapifix.exe&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\Mapifix.exe&quot;<br />
CopyFiles &quot;$EXEDIR\ETS Temp Fix.bat&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\ETS Temp fix.bat&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I have to define the EXEDIR? Isn't that predefined variable which means the files are part of the compiled EXE?<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be appreciated.. I'm not understanding the User Manual when it comes to copying files from the EXE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">14th April 2006, 04:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Your installer extracts files to the destination machine. You've done this with &quot;File.&quot; CopyFiles is for copying files from one spot on the destination machine to another, which I don't think you want to do in this case.<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
File &quot;Mapifix.exe&quot;<br />
File &quot;ETSTempfix.exe&quot;<br />
File &quot;ETS Temp fix.bat&quot;<br />
<br />
Try running that (assuming those 3 files are in the same directory on your computer as your script--if not, enter their full paths). You'll see those files in are now on the destination machine in $INSTDIR. So you had the right code...you were just trying to do an extra step that's not necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JATO</div><div class="date">21st April 2006, 03:12</div></div><div class="posttext">OK... now I'm not getting the copied failed errors..thank you<br />
 but no files were copied into the Directory<br />
The directory is there.. but empty.<br />
<br />
The 3 files are in the same directory as the script..but how do I know they were added to the EXE when it was compiled?<br />
<br />
I searched the user manual.. but can't find the command to ensure they are added to the EXE.. so I think my EXE doesn't have the 3 files compressed into it.<br />
<br />
Do I need to put something in the &quot;Function .onInit&quot; command?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">21st April 2006, 04:59</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to test your script, then why don't you try setting the OutPath to a different folder than your script? Otherwise, how are you going to know that anything actually happened?  <br />
<br />
Also:<br />
The compiler does a pretty good job of complaining if there are any errors adding files to your EXE.  If there were any problems, compiling will stop.  <br />
<br />
And if you look closely at the compiler's log, you'll see where each file was added.  It will look something like this:<br />
<br />
File: &quot;example1.nsi&quot; [compress] 388/831 bytes<br />
<br />
<br />
If you need more help, I suggest you look at some of the examples included with NSIS.  (The compiler example above came from the EXAMPLE1.NSI script located in the NSIS install folder.)</div></div><hr />
