<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asmdsr</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there<br />
<br />
I have constructed an installer which will detect and uninstall the previous (msi) version, via a call to ExecWait, after which the new (nsis) install continues.  This works perfectly under normal conditions.<br />
<br />
The problem comes during the program's built-in update feature.  When it detects an update, it downloads it and runs it via a win32 call to ShellExecute().  The installer runs, detects the old version and executes (ExecWait) the uninstall.  When the uninstall finishes the new install fails to resume, and the install hangs.<br />
<br />
Any clues?<br />
<br />
TIA<br />
Tim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asmdsr</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">OK so I've narrowed it down a bit... perhaps ExecWait is not hanging after all (I'm a bit of a n00b here, probably should do some logging or something here).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was not passing a show command in my ShellExecute:<br />
<br />
ShellExecute(NULL, &quot;open&quot;, [path to installer], NULL, NULL, NULL);<br />
<br />
If i use:<br />
	<br />
ShellExecute(NULL, &quot;open&quot;, [path to installer], NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);<br />
<br />
Then it works.  That doesn't solve my problem though, since my program is already out in the wild and I can't change that call.  However it does indicate that perhaps the installer is returning from ExecWait, but the next dialog is just not showing.  Is there a way to get the installer to tell itself to show?<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asmdsr</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">hah solved it using BringToFront:<br />
<br />
Function onGUIInit<br />
        BringToFront<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
Thankyou everybody.  I've achieved more in 24 hours with NSIS than I did in a year with MSI.  Wonderful.</div></div><hr />
