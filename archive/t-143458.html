<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">As I'm leaving tomorrow on vacation for a week, I have decided to release some partial work I have done in the last few days that might interest a lot of you.<br />
<br />
This version includes the possibility to easily show more than one license page (second license, readme page, whatever you want) and permits access to NSIS's NLF strings so you don't have to redefine them. A list of the LangString names is in Source\lang.cpp. To use any string in the uninstaller just prefix it with &quot;un.&quot; and NSIS will take care of the rest. This feature, hmm... Doesn't really work so good at the moment ;)<br />
<br />
You can get this version here:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/newstuff.zip<br />
An example is attached.<br />
<br />
I haven't uploaded it to CVS because it's not ready yet and I haven't completely tested it. If you find anything quirky it would help if you post it here. Expect encountering missing strings, mixed up strings and lots of weird characters if you're using a language that uses characters with the value of 253, 254 or 255.<br />
<br />
As I said, I'm going on vacation, so I won't be able to answer any forum/IRC questions in the next few days.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Source code included in the ZIP file of course...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">My flight got postponed, so I have made yet another version. Same URL, example attached. Notice there are now two directory pages and each one is using a different variable to work with. There is also a license agreement in the uninstaller, don't forget to read it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice!<br />
I may use the licence page for a readme...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th August 2003, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">More!<br />
<br />
Working example included in zip file (no need to compile).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TonyDS</div><div class="date">9th August 2003, 03:26</div></div><div class="posttext">What do I need to have for this to run, as I just keep getting a invalid command withPageEx<br />
<br />
I've just downloaded the latest updates, and it still doesn't compile</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">9th August 2003, 10:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you need the file from the link in the first post in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th August 2003, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The files required to compile the above example are not in CVS yet because they are not ready. You must use the files in the zip linked to above.<br />
<br />
I have updated the zip to contain the latest changes to support the last example (with the uninstall components page).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TonyDS</div><div class="date">9th August 2003, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Opps, sorry :) and thanks<br />
<br />
Oh just wondering is there or will there be Modern UI version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th August 2003, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course there will be. Once it's completely ready Joost will surely update the MUI to take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olomite</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 01:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Great addition!  I'm using the extra license pages to allow for an intro section, a requirements section and then a license section.  Is there a way to change the message box title so it doesn't append &quot;:License Agreement&quot; to each of those windows?  Thanks!<br />
Lance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">See SubCaption under documentation.<br />
Thinking now, how is it possible to use SubCaption when there are multiple LicensePage's; won't it place the same text on all?<br />
<br />
-Stu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Same URL, lots of new stuff. No more /LANG (one license for all languages for example), more default strings (default LicenseText for example) and more stuff that I don't remember.<br />
<br />
bla2.nsi is included in the zip file this time and shows how to set the caption too.<br />
<br />
I'll be back answering questions soon.<br />
<br />
Good night.<br />
<br />
Last beta before b4 if everything is ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Same URL, text color added (SetCtlColors), some old bugs with SetOutPath and File fixed and another one regarding /REBOOTOK on Windows 98.<br />
<br />
Help me test please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th August 2003, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Extraction progress added. Same URL.</div></div><hr />
