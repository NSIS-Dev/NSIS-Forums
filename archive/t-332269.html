<br />
We are looking for somebody to set up, tweak, and optimize a batch installation using NSIS. It would ideally be able to install several programs (that already have installers) in a row, but much more silently and cleanly than our current method. I developed a rudimentary NSIS installer for these software products, but lack the in-depth knowledge of NSIS scripting to make them work well. They do the job, but there is huge room for improvement. That's where you come in. Please let me know if you are interested, you can reach me at: installer at cimav dot com.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

If they don't have such a mode, there is nothing NSIS can do about it.<br />
<br />
(Well, unless those installers can be unpacked with, for example, 7zip, and you're ok with ripping the installers apart and doing all the dirty work yourself.)</div></div><hr />
