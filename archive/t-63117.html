   Version 1.59 is becoming cooler... but I thought I wanted something more coool for my new Product AnyEdit... so thought of adding some visual effects to the installer... Here is how it looks after the change :-) ... This adds around 12 Kb to the head though :( .. and I hope many NSIS er's are'nt going to flame me for changing the look... Justin, changing the color of the progress bar looks good though, why have it always plain... The same way as changing color of the list box we can have a option to change color of the progress bar too :-)., and an option to change between ordinary look of progress bar and smooth look.  Plus does any one want this code ... you can change the look of progress bar by adding &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;ProgressColor &quot;bgcolor&quot; &quot;fgcolor&quot;&lt;/b&gt;<br />
but for changing the picture you have to go and edit in the code ... <br />

<br />
Anyway the one thing I'd really like to see on that screen is a horizontal scroller so I and others will at long last be able to actually read the contents of the progress listbox....<br />

It is great that you have created something that other developers would like. So, I say this. Submit it to the NSIS Project House. Just PM me with any detail of DS.<br />

Would be excellant if someone could get a Bitmap=sjuhf.bmp thing working in the script - but 'tis still a good idea.  Maybe a pic along the top too would be nice (kinda like MS installer's tend to have)</div></div><hr />

   As I saw from the post there are a few who like it and a few who dont.., I thought of making a few more changes.  Now you can specify the bitmap to place as the brand bitmap with the following line in the script <br />
<br />
BrandBitmap='Filename.bmp'<br />
<br />
and the progress bar colors can be specified if necessary with<br />
<br />
ProgressColor [Foreground color] [Background color].<br />
<br />
I shall update the source and installer package at NSIS project house... <br />
<br />
The link will be up here sooon !<br />

I'm now gonna be torn between using ExoticMandables' version with the tickbox and yours with the bmp :)<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
<br />
Are you gonna do this with 1.6 final before it appears btw,  or will it be 1.59?</div></div><hr />

Once 1.6 final is out I shall update it again.  By the way what is the ExoticMandables' version ? <br />
<br />
I still didnt get the message from nsisphouse... so i shall be updating the package soon in my website on sourceforge and I shall give the link here...<br />
