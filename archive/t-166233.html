<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jddave</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm running an installer which include a lot of small files.<br />
<br />
Once completed, choosing no compression (nor in the script nor at command line), the resulting file is 46MB. Compressed with bz2 is 26MB.<br />
<br />
Since the application is divided into modules and the user doesn't always install all of them, I would like to divide even setup into smallest pieces / modules, because it take about 20 mins to compile.<br />
<br />
Compressing file before launching NSI compile I save 5 mins.<br />
<br />
Dividing into smallest modules, I should save time, because I should re-compile only the one changed.<br />
And since NSI script file is the one often changed I would save a lot ot time.<br />
<br />
Does any one know how to or have any idea to achive this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

I had a computer with Pentium 166, 16 MB RAM before, I compiled my program &quot;Registry Changer - C-Evo&quot; (2.26 MB) with LZMA in 1 minute or more (I don't really know if this is right, but was slow for me...)</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm a junior member because I just registered, but I'm using NSIS for almost an year.<br />
Anyway, any suggestion are well accepted.<br />
<br />
The computer I'm compiling with is a P-III @ 800MHz.<br />
I'm sorry for being not so clear, but 25MB is the size of compressed compiler. The source data are about 100MB. Almost all text of 1Kb to 4Kb, so a lot of small files to be compressed, and I fear this was the cause of so much time to compile.</div></div><hr />
