<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 00:30</div></div><div class="posttext">notice the link in my sig:  does the same thing (color support in v1.0b, language packs, etc).<br />
<br />
cya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkmercenary44</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 07:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats right, you have a sig to, :)  I've tried yours ummmmm let me see what version I have.  I've got v0.0.31, it doesn't work....some things are missing, and when you load a script file, it doesn't find all the commands right [course that could be cause I didn't make it with slate blue :)] And I can't find the color syntax part...all I see is the script editor at the bottom, with no color.  And when I click detach script it won't even let me put anything in the box its empty.  A couple of the commands don't have any options when you double click on them, and it won't let me enter in the values.<br />
<br />
And I get a bunch of errors when closing it, so I decide not to use it, no offense of course, I like the interface and style.  But its not what I want, and you never know there may be others out there like me.<br />
<br />
I just thought I would add another program to the bunch, don't get so crazy because someone else made a program that functions like yours...I'm not asking for donations or anything, so you can have all the money that someone would send...:)<br />
<br />
But anyways thanks for the 'feedback' I've tried all the editors and crap I could find and didn't like any of them so I made one.<br />
<br />
If you want to add color syntax highlighting easily, theres a control called CodeMax that lets you load language file [that you make] and it will do all the color work for ya.  Just thought I would let ya know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkmercenary44</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 07:11</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, I just found your version 1.0b, update your sig link, to point to your site download, I downloaded an OLD OLD version from ZDNet or something [thats what your sig points to], thats probably why I hate it so much....<br />
<br />
Let me download the new one and I'll tell ya what I think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkmercenary44</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 07:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I like v1.0 much better, but still no color, on startup and opening script [script parsing progress] I get &quot;An error has ocurred while calling the API function&quot;<br />
<br />
Just thought that you should know, but like the new style and options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkmercenary44</div><div class="date">12th January 2002, 22:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to be clear, I'm not badmouthing you or your program, it kindof sounds like that...sometimes I'm to blunt :)<br />
<br />
But I just thought you would like some feedback as to why someone like me doesn't like it all that much.<br />
<br />
Just like all I ask of the users that download mine, If you don't like it tell me why, flame me, curse me, whatever just tell me why so I know what I need to improve apon.<br />
<br />
Ok, just didn't want to end this post in bad terms with another programmer, so take it easy and if ya try NSIS Editor then drop me a line either in the forums here or at my email address darkmercenary44@prodigy.net and tell me your opinion...<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 02:15</div></div><div class="posttext">i realize you are not bad-mouthing SB.<br />
