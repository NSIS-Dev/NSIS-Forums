<br />
First of all, sorry for my bad english! I hope you will help me anyway. :)<br />
i'm working the first time with NSIS and this forum helps a lot. But i've got one Problem which i can't find here:<br />
<br />
I don't want to include all Files into the Setup.exe, i want them to be in an subfolder on my cd. So the Setup.exe would be in the root directory and all the program files are in &quot;InstallationFiles\&quot;. &lt;-- Including many sub folders.<br />
<br />
My installer works fine if i use &quot;File /r....&quot; but that way all the files are included in the setup.exe and the file is getting really large. <br />
<br />
The Problem:<br />
CopyFiles &quot;$OUTDIR\Program\*.*&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
doesn't work, and i can't find a solution how to copy all the files to my installation directory, including all files and sub folders.</div></div><hr />
