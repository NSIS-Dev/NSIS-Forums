<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SQwerl</div><div class="date">5th January 2002, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if anyone knew if you could make an NSIS installer, that would download and install options that the user selected. Something like the Netscape Installer. Basically trying to make it so that, users would only download the options that they would want. Instead of having to download a large file, and only use a few of the options. I would appreciate it if anyone has done something like this before, with the NSIS installer. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F. Heidenreich</div><div class="date">5th January 2002, 13:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You could do this by using the NSISdl extension dll that ships with NSIS. It's located at Contrib/NSISdl. Have a look at Readme.txt for an example.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps -<br />
