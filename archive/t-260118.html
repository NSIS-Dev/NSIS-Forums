<br />
I am sure, I will a have stupid question, but I need to ask ;)<br />
<br />
I use nsis for my job, for two years now, and I totally addict of it. So just thnaks you for that. <br />
So my question, I generate the setup with Linux version of<br />
nsis compiler. In the future I will need to have to make Linux setup too. And I don't want to be dependent of a package system, so no deb or rpm file.<br />
For the moment the only tool I found is makeself (the archive in compressed and save under a script shell.<br />
we launch this script shell and the data save inside is installed...<br />
... but it's not as fun as nsis... So do you have plan to make <br />
an Total linux nsis version ? <br />
And if not. do you think I should be an hard work to add this support on the linux nsis compiler ?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd November 2006, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides that, the scripting language is very Windows oriented. What would you have $PROGRAMFILES replaced for? What would you do with registry manipulations? I don't see how a script would be compilable on both Linux and Windows.<br />
<br />
A new version for Linux with other constants and commands would be nice, but I don't want to get into that. It'd take a lot of work and many other solutions already exist.</div></div><hr />
