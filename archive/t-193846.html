<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vun</div><div class="date">17th September 2004, 05:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I am having a problem with my desktop shortcut. I want my shortcut to run a batch file that is stored in the bin folder of my main application folder. I have set my $INSTDIR to be &quot;C:\foldername&quot; and this is also apparently the &quot;Start In&quot; of my shortcut. I want the &quot;start in&quot; to be something like &quot;C:\foldername\bin&quot;. I was wondering if it is possible to have 2 SetOutPath to solve my problem. I have already tried it but the compiler says I did not reference my variable and I am wasting memory. For a better understanding of my problem, I have attaced my code below. I apologise if this is a repeated thread but I do not understand what the other threads mean. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure I well understand your problem, but maybe you can do it like that. <br />
<br />
CreateShortCut &quot;$DESKTOP\SMSCenter.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\startup.bat&quot;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vun</div><div class="date">17th September 2004, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey kobus, thanks for your reply. I really appreciate it. However, I've already done what you asked me to do but each time i tried to run my application from the shortcut, the &quot;Start In&quot; would only have &quot;C:\projects&quot; which is my $INSTDIR. It dosent seem to read anything after my $INSTDIR. <br />
<br />
Eg: CreateShortCut &quot;$DESKTOP\SMSCenter.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\SMSCenter\bin\startup.bat&quot;<br />
<br />
It will not register &quot;SMSCenter\bin\&quot;. It only recognises $INSTDIR and only registers that as my &quot;Start In&quot;. I need my Start In to be in the bin folder because that's where my batch file is located. I hope this is clearer now :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobus</div><div class="date">17th September 2004, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, now it's clear, what is going on :)<br />
<br />
Documentation says:<br />
<br />
4.9.3.4 CreateShortCut<br />
... $OUTDIR is used for the working directory. You can change it by using SetOutPath before creating the Shortcut. ...<br />
<br />
so maybe it will works<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;x:\blabla\bin&quot; ; directory needed for shortcut working dir<br />
CreateShortCut .....<br />
SetOutPath &quot;c:\projects&quot; ; original Install directory<br />
<br />

My installer works fine now. I read that part of the documentation but I didnt really understand it. I really appreciate your quick responses and your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div></div><hr />
