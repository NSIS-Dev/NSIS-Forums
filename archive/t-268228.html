<br />
When I install app and there is a previous installation, uninstall and install work simultaneously.<br />
<br />
the result is files may be removed after they were updated.<br />
<br />
i am using Eexcwait, that means it doesn't wait at all.<br />
<br />
How to handle that?<br />
<br />
<br />
James</div></div><hr />
