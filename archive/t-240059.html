<br />
I used to have ExtractDLLEx working a few months back. I tried it again just now and it no longer works and I can't figure out why.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, I compress the files without a problem, on the client end I decompress them without a problem (ExtractDllEx returns success) yet no files get extracted. It's as if it's failing silently.<br />
<br />
Is there a way for me to get more debugging information out of this, such as what files got extracted and into what path?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Gili</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turns out that I used CompressFile.exe with an input path of:<br />
<br />
../foo/bar.dll<br />
<br />
and so when the file was extracted, it went into $INSTDIR/../foo/bar.dll which I totally did not expect to happen.<br />
<br />
Problem solved :)<br />
