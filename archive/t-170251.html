<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiclete</div><div class="date">20th February 2004, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I'm using this program for 3 days... so I don't know a lot of things and I'm trying to learn the basic =)....<br />
My problems are: I don't speak english very well...<br />
My program compressed is always bigger then if it wasn't compressed.<br />
And the other one is: I have subsections one called: Instalar that means Install in english and other called Extrair that means Extract in english. When you use &quot;install&quot;, the files are extracted to the &quot;TEMP&quot; and when using &quot;extract&quot; the files are sent to the &quot;INSTALLDIR&quot;, I want that when I choose both sections, the program use the &quot;install&quot; files from the &quot;INSTALLDIR&quot;, it means: when choosing both sections, no file will be sent to the (TEMP) and it will install by the (INSTALLDIR). If anybody can help me ... thanks since now. And don't forget about my other problem....<br />
&quot;SetCompressor lzma&quot; it's on my script. I'm not using the Modern UI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See the one-section.nsi example to get sections that work like option buttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiclete</div><div class="date">20th February 2004, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">In this script, when you choose one choice the other is unchoosed, but what I want is to change the (SetOutPath) and the (FILE) location... and not to unchoose the other, is there a way to not compress  files which are already compressed? not all files are already compressed on my script, and is there a location where I could see all the .xxx files who can't be compressed or are already compressed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">20th February 2004, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the Section.nsh macros to get section states.<br />
<br />
To use non-solid LZMA compression get a special build at the website and use SetCompression to turn compression on or off.</div></div><hr />
