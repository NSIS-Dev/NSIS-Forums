<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jamyn Shanley</div><div class="date">26th February 2006, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all.  I did find this (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Random) random number generator, and it looks excellent.  My interest is in a combination of letters and numbers though, as I will be using the result for a windows account password.<br />
<br />
I dug around on the forums and wiki a bit, but didn't find anything that matched something like this.  Does anyone know how this could be achieved? I thought about perhaps using the MD5 plugin to get sorta-random results, but I wasn't sure what file to use that would be constantly changing (and thus the MD5 signature would change frequently, making it harder for someone to &quot;guess&quot; the password based on knowing the file used to generate thee MD5).<br />
<br />
If anyone could help me on this, I would greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The MD5 (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/MD5_plugin) plugin does handle this by itself:<br />
<br />
#generate random MD5sum<br />
md5dll::GetMD5Random<br />
<br />
Excellent. :)</div></div><hr />
