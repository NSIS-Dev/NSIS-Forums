I am using NSIS for our installation programs. Now I need to store 10 clones of one file to prepared exe files and during the installing process dynamically choose one of them to copy to target PC. Does someone know how to store these 10 files into exe files elegantly?<br />
Thank you very much for your opinions.</div></div><hr />

${If} (some runtime condition here)<br />
File /oname=file.dat file_condition1.dat<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
See the manual:<br />

I need to compress many files bud decompressed only one file according a runtime condition. I am going to do it by repeating very similar parts of codes:(. It seems to me to be too difficult. Is there any possibility to use some loop structures or something more elegant;)? Thank you for your opinion:).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">otahalm</div><div class="date">25th July 2012, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have already solved it using this &quot;case&quot; statement:<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\$Condition&quot;<br />
${If} $Condition == &quot;11&quot;<br />
    File &quot;${SourceDir}\11\a.txt&quot;<br />
${ElseIf} $Condition == &quot;99&quot;<br />
    File &quot;${SourceDir}\99\a.txt&quot;<br />
${EndIf}<br />
This is easy enough. Thank you.</div></div><hr />
