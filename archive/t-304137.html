<br />
I have the following problem:<br />
<br />
In our company there is an update from XP to VISTA. We donâ€™t have any admin user rights and we will not get it. I have a program which I have developed in VB 6.0 with some OCX files which are no standard installation in VISTA anymore. <br />
<br />
Therefore you have to register these files with regserv32. But I donâ€™t have admin rights. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to register these files anyway? The administrator of our company told me that they could install the program via MSI packaging. But if they can provide the MSI file I should be able to great such a file too.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Sandro</div></div><hr />

<br />
If not, you can call RegOverridePredefKey before calling its DllRegisterServer function (you can not use regsrv32, you must load the dll and call it yourself)</div></div><hr />
