<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spatacoli</div><div class="date">13th January 2004, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to track down a few problems with log files. I have recompiled the source with the NSIS_CONFIG_LOG set in config.h. I also noted that there was a change made from Beta4 to RC1 where log_printf6 is defined twice in util.h. I noticed that this was added in so I changed it to log_printf7 (as it seemed to make sense in the code). This was just a warning, the error came because 'len' is not defined in exec.c. Not a problem because I don't generate any binary reg keys in my installer so I defined len as 0 since it is only being outputted to the log file and doesn't appear to be used anywhere else. Once that is taken care of, the sources will compile. I insert 'LogSet on' after I know that $INSTDIR is good, and I cannot find the install.log. It doesn't seem to have been created.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm this or is there something else going on in my code? Thank you for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spatacoli</div><div class="date">14th January 2004, 00:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so in reviewing that change in util.h, I noticed that in version 1.25 of the file each defined log_print is followed on by a log_write(0);. A call to log_write seems required to actually output anything, but the comments for the changes on this file aren't clear to me.<br />
<br />
Could someone review this code and see if it works as written?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spatacoli</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the most recent build that has these changes checked in. I recompiled with the NSIS_CONFIG_LOG set in config.h. However, I'm still not seeing the log file. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Use LogSet on, hold shift before entering the directory page or use SilentInstall silentlog.</div></div><hr />
