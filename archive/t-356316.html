<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xwwwx</div><div class="date">25th February 2013, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using the UAC plugin, I am testing with W7. My installer needs to drop a file on windows temp folder and execute it as user so I have something like this:<br />
<br />
	SetOutPath $Temp<br />
	File &quot;build.exe&quot;<br />
	!insertmacro UAC_AsUser_ExecShell &quot;&quot; &quot;$Temp\build.exe&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is that the build.exe file is not being executed, it works if I use $DESKTOP or any other folder that wont change depending on the user level. So I suspect the error is that, the file build.exe is being dropped in C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp (i can confirm this browsing the folder), and UAC_AsUser_ExecShell tries to execute it on C:\Users\normaluser\AppData\Local\Temp (i cant confirm this but i dont know what else could cause the file to not execute)<br />
<br />
I don't want to drop the files on the desktop or some folder like that, i wanted to use temp because I dont want to delete the file since i wont know when it ends the execution and didnt want to handle that.<br />
<br />
Is there any solution to this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
StrCpy $R0 &quot;$Temp\build.exe&quot;<br />
!insertmacro UAC_AsUser_ExecShell &quot;&quot; &quot;$R0&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />

I was trying to use the uac.dll from the git repo which seems to be a more updated version, with this dll i am now using UAC::GetShellFolderPath but I found that there's no CSIDL_ for the temp folder.</div></div><hr />
