<br />
Which Editor would you say is better or which one do you use and is it good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">17th April 2004, 03:19</div></div><div class="posttext">HM NIS Edit is the best for now. It has several options to customize the appearance, has code templates to put common function codes in your script (it should open from and store in files the codes), and the most important, you can create Install Options pages with its easy to use interface.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!<br />
<br />
:up: :up:</div></div><hr />

I like the wizard, pretty darn cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spatacoli</div><div class="date">19th April 2004, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used Venis, but with the release of version 2.2.2 the collapse just doesn't work right. Also, I've found that it puts strange characters at the end of some lines that cause NSIS compiler to say there are errors when there really isn't. It gets so bad that what I end up doing is either opening it up in HM NIS making a minor change and then saving it again, or opening the file up in VIM to fix the ^M that seems to be at the end of everyline.<br />
<br />
HM NIS is pretty much the only tool to use when making custom panel ini files. I wish it had the collapse feature that Venis has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalnos</div><div class="date">25th April 2004, 07:02</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically everyone goes with HM NIS Editor.</div></div><hr />
