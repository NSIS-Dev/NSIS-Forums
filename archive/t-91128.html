<br />
NSIS Error Installer verification failed. This could be the result of an incomplete download, a failing disc, or (possibly) corruption from a virus. you can try to force an install using the NCRC command line switch but it is NOT recommended..<br />
<br />
I even tryed the NCRC command line and it just sat there and looked at me, can someone help?</div></div><hr />

I will take my bet on the virus corruption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J_Bloggs</div><div class="date">15th June 2002, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I've scanned the entire computer for viruses (there's three hours gone), and there is none, so I'm thinking maybe spyware or the fact that I'm moving it from one computer to the other by way of floppy disk, is that a possibillity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th June 2002, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried scanning your hard drive using scandisk or Norton Disk Doctor or something alike? Have you tried downloading the installer again?<br />
<br />
Also search the forum, I think I have seen some cases like this one which were solved.<br />
<br />
Also try using scandisk on the floppy you move with...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J_Bloggs</div><div class="date">15th June 2002, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, tryed all of that. I guess I'll just try again.</div></div><hr />
