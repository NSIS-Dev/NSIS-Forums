<br />
When I uninstall my software some of the directories still remain....they are not deleted in spite of the fact that I have given lines to remove them in my script...What could I be possibly doing wrong...Is there way in which I can delete all the directory(including sub directories) in a single go when all files are deleted?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
Rikkov</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should find out why the folder isn't being removed, though.. does a file remain that you should have deleted first?  Did you use SetOutpath at any point to make it the 'active' folder and you have to use 'SetOutpath $TEMP' to clear it? etc.</div></div><hr />
