<br />
I did an install for my JAVA application. <br />
On Windows 7 the install ask for the admin password to install my application. Once the password is entered everything is well installed.<br />
But the first time the application start it ask for a setup file and perform some editing in a property file. As the current user as no right on the application folder the property file is not modified and my application can not run, somehow it is freezing.<br />
Is it possible during the setup to define read/write and modifiy rights on the application folder and recursively on subfolders and files for users?<br />
<br />
Regards, Max</div></div><hr />
