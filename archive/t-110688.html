Hmm, looks like you aren't very familiar with CVS. The benefit of CVS is that it always contains the latest version of the source files, as well as the complete history of the files.<br />
<br />
PS: Please remove *.plg, *.ncb, *.opt, *.aps, *.clw from the repository, these are temporary files created by Visual C++, they should not be in the repository.<br />
<br />
PPS: Which CVS client do you use? My favourite CVS tool is TortoiseCVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 04:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an NSIS editor available to the public called Venis.<br />
<br />
Venis is not a wizard to create a new install, rather it is an editor to allow you to maintain current install scripts.  It features syntax highlighting, compiler results and other typical editor tools.  Future versions will include an editable word file, a function wizard pop up dialog you can drag and drop into your code and pop up function argument tips.<br />
<br />
Next release will incorporate the wordfile and some typical functions with the function wizards.  Function argument tips and full featured function wizards are planned for a release by the end of the year.<br />
<br />
Please visit the Venis site and please do not hesitate to give me feedback on features/improvements you would like to see.  E-mail: angelo@spaceblue.com<br />

No ;). An NSI-editor can help with the syntax of the instructions, wizards to simplify some standard operations and to provide additional features in the form of things like a compiler-output log analyzer. When there is a working and good editor, I think that many programmers will use those editors to write their scripts.<br />
And by the way, syntax highlighting is only nescessary to make your code better readable.:eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simian Jones</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be surprised to find a better editor than NSIS Workbench.  Are any of these editors adding any functionality that Workbench doesn't have?  The only approach that I could see that would be worth pursuing would be something that is more along the lines of Inno's excellent ISTool.  With that tool you can edit the script directly or you can view the script in terms of sections, files, registry keys you are modifying, custom types, etc, providing a more object based approach.<br />
<br />
I applaud those that wish to make a nice GUI for this great installer, but it makes more sense to make a better GUI rather than just another one.</div></div><hr />

You're welcome although I just hosted the file, I didn't create it. Unfortunately I forget now where I got it from, I've a feeling that I found it in another post that recommended Scite but I can't be sure off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
My website is *very* out of date now compared to the current developments in NSIS, but then I recently had computer hardware hell, I lost two harddisks and a processor in the space of a month :( ... hopefully (fat chance, but I can dream) I'll actually get around to doing the site updates now that my computer is fixed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 12:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Some improvements that will be in N.I.C.E. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis-nice) version 0.02 Alpha are:<br />
<br />
 Syntax highlighting (when I can figure out how to do that in VB6)<br />
 Some wizards for common tasks<br />
 XML-compiler for faster loading<br />
 Easy help access via the right panel<br />
<br />
<br />
Some improvements in future versions are:<br />
<br />
 New project wizard<br />
 Auto-update (NSIS and N.I.C.E.)<br />
 Documentation reading<br />
 Language file editor<br />
 Show possible parameters (simple)<br />
 Show possible parameters (extended)<br />
<br />
<br />
What do I mean with...?<br />
XML-compiler for faster loading: The editable XML-file with the instructions will be put in an non-editable file. This file does not have to be parsed and thus will it load faster.<br />
<br />
Auto-update: The program downloads automatically the newest versions of NSIS and N.I.C.E. and installs them.<br />
<br />
Documentation reading: N.I.C.E. will be able to read the NSIS documentation and install the new and changed instructions, parameters and description.<br />
<br />
Show possible parameters (simple): A yellow bar with the intruction and it's parameters will apprear under the cursor when you type an instruction.<br />
<br />
Show possible parameters (extended): The editor will show a little window with options for the parameters for the instruction.</div></div><hr />

What do I mean with...?<br />
Language component: An OCX-file that can read XML-coded and NSIS-like language files for my program and for the Language File editor that I am building.

I'll propably get one of these programs next weekend, and then I'm going to rewrite the program in it. Visual Basic 6 is way to limited.<br />
<br />
So: Please wait about two weeks. Then I'll release a new (completely rewritten) version of N.I.C.E.<br />

 ablility to run makensis from within<br />
 good shortcut keys (F5 to compile, for instance)<br />

 maybe a side bar of functions that I can double click on (I dbl click on licenseText and it inserts that into my script)<br />
 Find/Replace (essential, and shortcut key would be Ctrl-H)<br />

<br />
I know a lot of these features exist already in some of the editors, and some others are much harder to do, but if I could make a wish list of what I would want from an editor, this is what it would be...<br />

as long as there is all this talk about an editor, these are the things I think I would like in one:<br />
Thank you for your wishlist. Until now, I had to come up with all the features. About your wishlist:<br />
<br />
 Autocomplete (like in vb6) I am going to implement this<br />
 text highlighting If I can figure out how. On PSC (http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb), I couldn't find any code that would do that nicely (without selecting, coloring, deselecting etc.) In VB.net or C#, it should be easier.<br />
 short wizard for starting project That will be in the program for sure.<br />
 ablility to run makensis from within I tought of the 'Compile' and 'Run' menu item like in VB6.<br />
 good shortcut keys (F5 to compile, for instance) That is already implemented in the 0.01 Alpha release of N.I.C.E.<br />
 autosave option Good idea.<br />
 line numbers/character spacing (Row 12, Col 45) Will also be implemented.<br />
 fast execution (difference between starting notepad and starting ms word) This might be a slight problem, since N.I.C.E. now has to load a complete library of instructions, and that makes execution slow. (like in the 0.01 Alpha version)<br />
 collapseable sections (Scintilla can do this, you can collapse sections of code during edit) Maybe...<br />
 maybe a side bar of functions that I can double click on (I dbl click on licenseText and it inserts that into my script) Definitly. I tought about a sidebar with functions, where some (or all of the functions) have a wizard attached which helps you with inserting.<br />
 Find/Replace (essential, and shortcut key would be Ctrl-H) Definitly.<br />
<br />
Some other things that I want to implement are:<br />
<br />
 Script rewriting (removes all the spaces and tabs from the beginning of the lines and add them again, for nice code-readability)<br />
 Complete block comment (out)<br />
 Anything else...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">And I am sorry to inform you all, that the N.I.C.E. Script Editor project is stopped:cry:, because of the following reasons:<br />
<br />
 It's too hard for me, since I'm only 16 years old and I have never used a book in order to learn Visual Basic.<br />
 VB is too simple.<br />
 I can never finish a project when I start with it.<br />
<br />
And N.I.C.E. GUI will propably also stop:cry: because of the same reasons. I made a beginning, but if anyone is interested in the Visual Basic source, let me know (PM me).:weird:<br />
<br />
But I started with a much simpler project: N.I.C.E. Dialog Editor :D, but I also ran into some problems. The foundation is ready, and I could release the program if no-one cares about the fact that you can't use 'comboboxes', 'checkboxes', 'droplists' or 'listboxes' and that you can't group radiobuttons. But I don't think so.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if FrostByte 2k2 reacted to the PM's and emails I send him a month ago, then we could work together.</div></div><hr />
