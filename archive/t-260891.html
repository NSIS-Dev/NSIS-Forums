<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DamagedGenius</div><div class="date">2nd December 2006, 03:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, ladies and gents, no amount of troubleshooting could seem to fix this issue. I'm writing an uninstaller which is supposed to unregister some certain DLLs and then it deletes them. If I use &quot;UnRegDll&quot;, I get a C++ Runtime error for my script. If I use nsExec::Exec &quot;regsrv32.exe&quot; it works, but then certain user interfaces features (most notably the search function of windows) no longer has any text or input boxes. It works if I just delete the folders, but for safety's sake I'd prefer to unregister the DLLs first. Is there any way to fix/ignore/skip this error? The program can continue if it occurs, but continues in the background. (Until you click &quot;close program&quot; in the error window).<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is rather confusing, but I'm tired and trying my best to figure this out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, everyone.</div></div><hr />

As for the runtime errors, they come from the DLL itself as NSIS doesn't use the CRT. You should contact the author of this DLL for support and for instructions detailing how it should be installed and uninstalled, assuming it should be uninstalled at all. For example, MSVCRT.dll is used by so many applications that it's usually safer to just keep it or install a local copy of it instead.</div></div><hr />
