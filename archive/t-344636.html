<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpcoffey</div><div class="date">4th May 2012, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Anders, great news!  Thanks for your prompt reply.  :)  Can you give us an idea of what is going to happen moving forward?  <br />
<br />
<br />
 Are there going to be two forks from now on with a choice of Unicode or ANSI?  <br />
 Are the forks going to be eventually merged to a common version 3.0?<br />
 Do you have a rough idea as to when this is going to take place?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anders, you guys have done a great job with NSIS and we are all very appreciative.  I am only asking because it has been so long since we have received any guidance as to what the road ahead will look like.  You may not have known yourself, so we can completely understand.  Thank you for any feedback you can provide.   :)<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
JPCoffey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">4th May 2012, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the fork has already been merged. (What happens to the fork is out of our control, once we release v3.0 the fork will probably die)<br />
v3.0 will be a unicode compiler that can also create ANSI installers.<br />
Everything related to reading/writing files and !system needs to be rewritten, once that is done we should be getting closer to a release. (No timeframe)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">7th May 2012, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Introduce LZMA2 if possible.<br />
<br />
AFAIK, the LZMA2 algorithm doesn't generally compress &quot;better&quot; than the LZMA(1) algorithm. It may even compress worse! It allows to compress the the data in several independent blocks, which allows for more efficient multi-threading. This may be important if you compress several gigabytes of data. But I doubt it will be that useful for NSIS installers...</div></div><hr />
