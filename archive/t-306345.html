<br />
I'm new to NSIS so sorry if this seems like a stupid question. Is it possible to request a file from the internet as part of the setup? All I need to do is trigger the file which is a script on my server that logs how many times my app has been installed. I don't need to save the contents of this file anywhere and it should ignore the step if it fails or if the user isn't connected to the internet.<br />
<br />
Is anything like this possible with NSIS?</div></div><hr />

That downloads a file to a temporary location, which gets cleared up once the installer exits (or you can delete the file yourself immediately afterrward).</div></div><hr />
