<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zilch</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm assuming this may be a fairly common requirement, but I haven't found any mention of it anywhere...<br />
<br />
I have an application that creates directories under the users $APPDATA directory (for multi-user support).  This means that if Tom, Dick and Harry have use the application under their own logins, there will be a directory structure like so:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\Tom\Application Data\Foo<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\Dick\Application Data\Foo<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\Harry\Application Data\Foo<br />
<br />
...where Foo is the name of the app.<br />
<br />
So what is the cleanest way to remove these directories on uninstall?<br />
<br />
Should I just remove &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\*\Application Data\Foo&quot;?  Or is that just bad form?<br />
<br />
Currently I am writing (one of) the user settings dir to the uninstall section of the registry and reading it back, but really I need to write the all.  I could make an APPDIR key that contains them all like:<br />
<br />
&quot;C:\Documents and Settings\Tom\Application Data\Foo;C:\Documents and Settings\Dick\Application Data\Foo;C:\Documents and Settings\Harry\Application Data\Foo&quot;<br />
<br />
...but am I likely to run into limitations of the length of strings the registry can hold?  And is there an easy way to split the string on ; in NSIS?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help,<br />
<br />

<br />
Writing it into multiple registry keys would be the best solution. Why should it be all in one key?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mainly because I don't know how to do it in NSIS (short of writing a plugin).  Is there an example of an easy way to read an arbitrary sized bunch of registry strings and then remove them?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />

<br />
One solution would be to use numbers: key 1 contains folder 1, key 2 contains folder 2 etc.</div></div><hr />
