<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArialScorpio</div><div class="date">7th October 2004, 06:57</div></div><div class="posttext">i hv created the setup of my vb app. in NSIS. In most of the places its working perfectly but in few locations m getting a runtime error 50003 after installation, when user try to run the app. This runtime error is due to some conflict in registeration of dlls. I am using UpgradeDll function and the sample script given in NSIS help to install VB runtimes. Can anybody help me to sort out this problem. Its urgent.</div></div><hr />

It's also possible a reboot is needed but has not taken place. Do you use the finish page or check the reboot flag yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArialScorpio</div><div class="date">11th October 2004, 05:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for seeking your interest in my problem. I am pretty sure that I haven't missed any dependency as software is working fine in lots of places as i also mentioned earlier. Only from few client sites i am getting this error. I would be thankful to you if you could tell me how to ensure that we don't have two versions of same DLL or OCX on client's machine. Secondly how to restart the machine after setup through NSIS. Who knows this would be the cause of this error. Anyway thanks again.<br />
Hope to get positive reply from you.</div></div><hr />

Some DLL that comes with Internet Explorer 6, for example.<br />
<br />
If you're using the MUI, the finish page asks the user to reboot, if needed. If you're not using the MUI, you should check the reboot flag using IfRebootFlag and reboot using Reboot, or at least let the user know a reboot is needed.</div></div><hr />

I also recommend you to upgrade to NSIS 2.01 and use the new library system to install VB runtimes.</div></div><hr />
