<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ddod</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been reading all the forum threads regarding starting dos commands or batch files and have determined that nsExec should do what I want it to.  However I am having some issues with it casuing the graphics of my installer to hang (using moder UI).<br />
<br />
Here is a brief explanation of my install program.  It is basically a wrapper for an MSI.<br />
<br />
get user input<br />
NSIS Installs files for MSI Installation.<br />
custom leave funtions for MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES hides installer and runs the MSI with appropriate switches<br />
some final pages then determine if MSI installed properly, etc<br />
<br />
However, I have a few command line scripts that I want to run as soon as the MSI install finishes succesfully.  I don't want the dos windows to show so I am trying it with nsExecLog (the output would be nice to display but not necessary).  However, whenever I run this the gaphics hang until the commands finish.<br />
<br />
I have placed the commands in several areas of the code with the same result.<br />
<br />
It is logging the command' output to the installer window but I can't see it happening.  I know it is logging because if I place a message box after the nsExec commands the installer re-paints when the message box appears and I can see the appropriate result in the log window.<br />
<br />
No matter where I run these commands I can't get it to post the output while it is happening.  And the installer hanging will not be acceptable<br />
<br />
I also put all the commands into a batch file and ran <br />
<br />
ExecShell &quot;open&quot; 'firewall.bat' SW_HIDE and<br />
ExecShell &quot;&quot; 'firewall.bat' SW_HIDE<br />
<br />
which runs the batch file fine, but the dos windows still appears even though I have the SW_HIDE option set.<br />
<br />
None of these commands seem to be behaving the the documentation states.  What am I doing wrong.</div></div><hr />

You should either display a Banner (see Contrib\Banner) or use DetailPrint if calling it in a Section.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ddod</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Banner looks like it might work to keep the user busy while these commands run.  However I am getting strange results with it and the ModernUI.  The example file for it says:<br />
<br />
# Look at Readme.txt for usage alongside with the Modern UI<br />
<br />
Yet no readme.txt was supllied for this dll in the NSIS install.<br />
<br />
Where can I find it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Docs folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ddod</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, Thanks.  Does MSIBanner work with the modern UI.  I just tried it and it crashed the program.  I can't find any documentation about the MSIBanner other than the samples.  There is a clue about needing to destroy it in a &quot;Section&quot; section.  I can't do this becasue I would use this Banner after the section have completed.<br />
<br />
Also no one has answered why the SW_HIDE is not working on the ExecShell command.</div></div><hr />

MSIBanner related thread ;) http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=211870 and wiki page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/Banner_with_Cancel_button) with latest version.<br />
It is possible to make DOS plug-in (nsExec or ExecDos)running with /NOUNLOAD (additional thread) but not implemented yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ddod</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">So the documentation for ExecShell is innacurate?<br />
<br />
According to the threads you gave me, it appears that MSIBanner is obsolete and the nxs.dll replaces it?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</div></div><hr />
