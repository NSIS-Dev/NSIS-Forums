<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m0rbid</div><div class="date">16th July 2006, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I don't know if its possible to create what i want but if it is I definitly do need some help.<br />
<br />
Ok what i want to do is is first to search the computer for 1 required file and 3 optional files wich must be in the same directory as the req. one. Lets call them &quot;req1&quot;, &quot;opt1&quot;, &quot;opt2&quot; and &quot;info&quot;<br />
<br />
Than on the directory page instead of the normal box where you can put in your install directory have a dropdown box containing the paths found earlier. (but still should be able to manual point the installer to another location)<br />
<br />
But it gets more complicated now, for a found path to be valid and shown in the dropdownbox it must behave like this:<br />
<br />
req1 + opt1 or <br />
req1 + opt2 or <br />
req1 + opt1 + opt2<br />
<br />
The last optional file (&quot;info&quot;) is a dummy file wich comes with the installer containing a version number and date.<br />
However if present it should read out a line of the dummy file and print it in light gray on the backdrop of the dropdownbox.<br />
<br />
Also it should be sorted in 2 Groups in the box, all in all it should look like  this. Note g1p1 means group 1 path 1 :)<br />
req1 + opt1 should be group 1 and req + opt2 group 2, if it is req + opt1 + op2 the path should be added to both groups<br />
<br />
Crappy Visualization:<br />
<br />
<br />
1st Group Caption    ;only shown if g1 path is present<br />
-------              ;as above<br />
g1p1 <br />
g1p2<br />
<br />
2nd Group Caption    ;only shown if g2 path is present<br />
-------              ;as above<br />
g2p1<br />
g2p2       info   ;&quot;info&quot; file found printing a line of it<br />
<br />
Well thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure you can't place text in the background of the control though.<br />
<br />
To search for files, you can either use my RecFind header for ease of use here:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/RecFind:_Recursive_FindFirst%2C_FindNext%2C_FindClose<br />
Or use the Locate plugin, which will search for your files the fastest:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m0rbid</div><div class="date">16th July 2006, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">${locate::Open} &quot;C:\&quot; &quot;/N=req1 /-PN=Temp|WINDOWS /A=-READONLY|-ARCHIVE /SD=NAME&quot; $var<br />
<br />
${locate::Unload}<br />
<br />
This would load the locate plugin, search for file named &quot;req1&quot; ignore temp/Windows directories and hidden/system files and sort the found paths alphabetical, then unload the plugin.<br />
<br />
What i need in addition is to search all drives, so what do i put in the syntax for it above?<br />
Also i don't quite get it how do save the found path(s), note that i need only the parent directory of the file when it was found eg. if file is at c:\hello\req1.exe i need c:\hello<br />
<br />
A example of  find fileA, hand path over for nextsearch would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get the directory path of the file, use the GetParent function which should be under Useful Scripts in the NSIS documentation.<br />
