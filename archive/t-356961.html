<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">7th March 2013, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, may be this is well-known issue, but search returned 0 results (and I not read forum for a long time :( ).<br />
Last days I received few reports about problems with installer start on computers with 64-bit Windows 7. Up to now Windows 2008 and 2012 are OK. Google offers to run programs in XP-compatibility mode, but would be good to know if any other workaround exists.<br />
I attached screenshots of error message, target system description and PE Explorer info for the distribution file.<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Thanks in advance ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aminifu</div><div class="date">8th March 2013, 06:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If this is a work place system, maybe there are policies in place blocking installation of media players.<br />
<br />
Also, as a side issue, a 3.4 Experience Index seems low for even an older Intel cpu and 4 GB of memory. Does the system run ok otherwise, with other 32-bit apps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">8th March 2013, 08:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, MSG, I'll ask customers to double check emulation. Strange that this happened on 6 computers in 2 different locations. Also customers might send incorrect information and package was damaged. On my Win7 64-bit English VM this not reproduces. I still hope to get access to one of the comps. What I really worry about is that some new MS KB* patch was applied to those systems. But while no other reports with the same situation, probably this is not NSIS compiler compatibility problem.<br />
Thanks, Aminifu, fortunatelly media player is not included :). All comps equipped for server' purposes, so performance should be OK. But I'll ask to check this again. 32-bit application execution will be a part of WOW64 emulation check.</div></div><hr />
