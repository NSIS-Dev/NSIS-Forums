<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">26th July 2003, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever I leave my computer idle for extended periods of time (after the screen saver has come on, after the monitor turns off and after the hard drive turns off), and then I come back to my computer, the NSIS compiler doesn't work properly. I can resolve the issue by rebooting...but, this gets kind of annoying after awhile. I'm on Windows ME, by the way.<br />
<br />
Here is the error message that I get:<br />
<br />
Unable to initialize MakeNSIS. Please verify that makensis.exe is in the same directory as makensisw.exe.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to correct this issue would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">26th July 2003, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...is it?<br />
makensis.exe and makensisw.exe are they in the same folder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">26th July 2003, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they are in the same folder...otherwise, it wouldn't even work after I rebooted. Any ideas why I have to reboot to correct this issue?</div></div><hr />

If you're asking if MakeNSISW was up and running when I left my computer alone...then the answer is &quot;No&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If so I can preper a special version that will give some more information along with this message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">31st August 2003, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've upgraded to Windows 2000 recently (from Windows ME, where I was having the problem). I haven't seen the issue in Windows 2000, yet, but I'll let you know if I do. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
