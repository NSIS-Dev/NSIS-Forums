I.e. the user can select where they wanted to install a file and now I need to find it.  I know the file name but need to search specific folder trees and find out where it is.<br />
<br />
Any ideas/help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Locate::Find can search for just a file name and returns the full path and name of any files found (second parameter to the Find call).<br />
<br />
There was post in this forum about using it with GetDrives to search all local drives for files only a few days ago - the solution provided looked pretty good.<br />
