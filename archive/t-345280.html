<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">1st June 2012, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't know where this macro (http://pastebin.com/3FeNdUwc) came from, i couldn't find it on the wiki or the forum. i'm pretty sure though i got it from someone here.<br />
<br />
so, i've been using this for some years now and never ran into a problem. from what i remember, this allowed me building an installer with user rights and whenever it runs an executable, it will display an elevation dialog if required by the executable.<br />
<br />
however, i've been told it won't work if the path or the executable contains a single quote. any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">1st June 2012, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">That macro uses the SEE_MASK_NOCLOSEPROCESS (0x00000040) flag meaning that your code is leaking process handles. Other than passing the working directory as a parameter without having to use SetOutPath, this macro has no advantage over ExecShell...<br />
<br />
Edit: I'm guessing somebody that does not know what they are doing copied parts of this macro (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellExecWait). That macro has the same single quote issue but at least it provides some actual value over ExecShell...</div></div><hr />

i have no idea. as i said, this was recommended me to someone as i wanted to be able to execute a program with admin rights even if the installer runs with user rights only. from what i remember a simple exec didn't execute such a program, whereas this macro popped up an elevation dialog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A normal ExecShell will do that (ExecShell calls ShellExecute and Exec[Wait] calls CreateProcess)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">1st March 2013, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">hm, i noticed when using ExecShell runas it only works with .exe files but .msi files will not open at all. is this a limitation by windows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">1st March 2013, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">An MSI file is not an executable. You must use msiexec.exe.<br />
<br />
Edit: And why are you using runas exactly? You should just use RequestExecutionLevel (along with UserInfo) to ensure the installer is already elevated before any installation occurs.<br />
