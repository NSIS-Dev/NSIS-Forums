I'm not sure when Joost will have time to upload it into CVS, but be sure to look out for it if you were interested.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions concerning the code or have suggestions on how to improve, you can direct them to me ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, ok, just haven't read the whole readme (this code is written in Borland Delphi 6 and compiles with the freely available Personal edition), maybe this should not be added only to the changelog. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th August 2003, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Changed that.<br />
<br />
The UI is not that important, the GenPat tool is very easy to use and the Readme contains good instructions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">12th August 2003, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">then the gui is the same thing as the command line tool? i hoped it is something like a 2 directory compare and set up a patch file or something :) (haven't compiled it yet, got to complicated with registering that stuff)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">12th August 2003, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not yet created the non-NSIS distribution, which will have a precompiled GUI. The GUI allows you to select a single old file, and then (multiple) old versions of that file. Then you can use a slider to set the block size, and hit &quot;generate&quot;.<br />
When there were lots of options to set, the GUI was useful, but currently the command line version is just as powerful.<br />
<br />
A directory compare is not in there. That is because generally, you should only patch *big* files which are changed. The savings of patching a 10KB readme to a new version, for example, is not worth the effort. And executable patching does not generally give good compression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">12th August 2003, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, the thing is that i have a 100mb distribution to patch to a new version with many files changed and keep the package as small as possible...<br />
<br />
at the moment i compare two directories with a compare program which gives out a file list and a small nsis setup using the command line tool to make a patch file and generate patch code, maybe something like this in a more professional made shape would be helpful<br />
<br />
and thx for the great plugin, thats a very important add to nsis!<br />
