<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nabukodonosor</div><div class="date">22nd January 2006, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there. I a newbie in all this. What I want is to extract some Dll files in some folder in Program Files (INSTDIR). I did this. Next what i want is to ectract some other files to C:\some folder\folder 2\. I don't know how to do that.<br />
Also, some of those files are .ax files, and need to be registered. In &quot;real life&quot; these files register file called regsvr32.exe. How to manage to do this? tnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">23rd January 2006, 05:54</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Use the SetOutPath command to set your working directory and then a File command to extract the file into that directory.  Alternatively, you can use the /oname switch on the File command to specify an output directory, but since this option must be used with each file, I prefer to use the former.<br />
<br />
2.  Use the RegDLL command to register files.  It works the same as RegSvr32.<br />
<br />
More information about both commands is in your NSIS user's guide.  You can also find working examples in your NSIS Examples folder included with the NSIS install.</div></div><hr />
