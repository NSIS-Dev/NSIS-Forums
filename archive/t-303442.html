<br />
<br />
I just got started with NSIS, but i feel pretty comfortable with the script language.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now my question was: Is there a way to patch a zip file with only the .pat file in the installer.<br />
<br />
<br />
and how do i get the .pat file into the installer etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there a step by step someone could show me, or make one?<br />
<br />
That would be awesome, thanks!:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">25th February 2009, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">have you considered the VPatch plugin?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">creepin</div><div class="date">25th February 2009, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, i know that.<br />
<br />
<br />
my question was, how do i use the vpatch plugin? and does it work with .zip files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">25th February 2009, 00:26</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, it works with .zip files (that is to say, it can patch one zip to another..it doesn't patch files within; you'd have to extract those first)<br />
<br />
as for how to use it... there's bot documentation...<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/VPatch_plug-in<br />
<br />
...and an NSIS code generator (where you just specify the old file, the new file, it generates the patch file -and- NSIS code to patch that file)...<br />
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsispatchgen<br />
<br />
Couldn't be easier, really :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">creepin</div><div class="date">25th February 2009, 00:32</div></div><div class="posttext">well, ok, if i have to include the entire new .zip <br />
<br />
then i wont need this anyways, i thought about patching a .zip while only including the additional data in the installer..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">25th February 2009, 04:17</div></div><div class="posttext">well you don't have to include the entire new zip.<br />
<br />
let's say you have a ZIP file... my_archive.zip<br />
and it contains...<br />
  somefile.exe<br />
  hello_world.txt<br />
  blabla.ini<br />
<br />
Now you change something in hello_world.txt, and create a new archive.. my_archive2.zip<br />
Then with vPatch, you can certainly create a patch file for the difference between my_archive.zip and my_archive2.zip , and you would only have to include that tiny .pat file.<br />
<br />
vPatch doesn't care whether the file is a ZIP or not, it just checks for file differences.<br />
<br />
I think this is what you want, and that should be fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I meant earlier was this..<br />
<br />
Say you have a myfile.zip with hello_world.txt, and you have a new hello_world.txt with changes, and you make a patch file for the difference between the two hello_world.txt versions.<br />
<br />
Then, with vpatch, you can't adjust the hello_world.txt -inside- myfile.zip with a patch.  You'd have to extract that file from the zip first, patch the hello_world.txt with vpatch, and then re-zip it.</div></div><hr />
