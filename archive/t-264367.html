<br />
I'm trying to capture any errors my applications may come across, but after searching the forums etc I'm still can't see an explanation.<br />
<br />
I can see an error if I do something like:<br />
<br />
ClearErrors<br />
    &lt;try to create file x&gt;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
    DetailPrint &quot;Error creating file x&quot;<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
It seems like I can only get an &quot;errorFlag&quot; raised and that I have to know the context of the error; i.e I was trying to create &quot;file x&quot; and it failed.<br />
<br />
I'd like to do something like:<br />
<br />
ClearErrors<br />
    &lt;try to create file x&gt;<br />
    &lt;try to create file y&gt;<br />
    &lt;try to create file z&gt;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
    DetailPrint &quot;Error creating file &lt;name of file&gt;&quot;<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
...but I think I may have to write:<br />
<br />
ClearErrors<br />
    &lt;try to create file x&gt;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
    DetailPrint &quot;Error creating file x<br />
${EndIf}<br />
ClearErrors<br />
    &lt;try to create file y&gt;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
    DetailPrint &quot;Error creating file y&quot;<br />
${EndIf}<br />
ClearErrors<br />
    &lt;try to create file z&gt;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
    DetailPrint &quot;Error creating file z&quot;<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
Is this correct, or am I missing something? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

ClearErrors<br />
File &quot;${file}&quot;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;error with ${file}&quot;<br />
${EndIf}<br />
!macroend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drod</div><div class="date">25th January 2007, 21:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys. I'd realised I could wrap checks into macros, but I thought there may be a way to be more intelligent by say checking errors status codes returned by each command.<br />
<br />
It just seems that it could make the code very bulky if I have to check the status of most of the commands I run.</div></div><hr />

So where is the difference if instead of:<br />
ClearErrors<br />
File &lt;try to create file x&gt;<br />
IfErrors do_this do_that<br />
<br />
you were using:<br />
File &lt;try to create file x&gt; $0 ;return var<br />
StrCmp $0 &quot;&lt;errorlevel&gt; do_this do_that<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem a difference to me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I was writing a Unix script I'd be able to access the return code in the &quot;$?&quot; variable - this may be say &quot;2&quot; for &quot;no such file&quot;, or &quot;13&quot; for &quot;permission denied&quot; etc. You could pass that info back to the user so they knew the cause of the error.<br />
<br />
Unless I'm missing it, I only seem to be able to get a &quot;you had an error&quot; here. I think this means that I have to wrap each call with a &quot;clearErrors/IfError&quot; type block in order to offer a little more info; eg<br />
<br />
ClearErrors<br />
&lt;open file for writing&gt;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Cannot open file for writing&quot;<br />
${Else}<br />
ClearErrors<br />
&lt;try to write&gt;<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Cannot write to file&quot;<br />
${Endif}<br />
${Endif}<br />
<br />
Does that make sense?</div></div><hr />

I thought we're talking about file extraction, indeed regarding to file extraction doesn't make any noticeable difference.</div></div><hr />
