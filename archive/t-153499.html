<br />
A dated directory created everytime this program is run.<br />

 Why can't everyone just write in Qbasic. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">22nd October 2003, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">But have a strange thing with the NSISDt, much times, he increase or decrease the time by 1 hour. Using it in South Hemisphere is even worse. The better one is from the API &quot;GetLocalTime&quot;. Reveals additionally the weekday and the miliseconds of the time called (but i.e. you don't get the Time Zone name, you have to call it using System Plugin). But you have format the result using some codes in the page. Get it in my signature (below):</div></div><hr />
