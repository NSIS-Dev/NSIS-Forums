<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I experienced some problems with the latest CVS version of NSIS.<br />
<br />
In the MUI:<br />
LicenseLangString: Please add remark at the MUI_PAGE_LICENSE documentation! <br />
<br />
Please also add a sample for multiple parameters with LanguageStrings. Add an remark in the Syntax section of the documentation. I don't know how to get MUI_LICENSEPAGE_TEXT with two<br />
LanguageStrings to work. What about language strings in other strings? I cannot find a topic in the documentation regarding this feature.<br />
<br />
Please extend the multilanguage sample. It only shows very few features of multilanguage setups!<br />
<br />
During the compilation I get the following warnings:<br />
<br />
GERMAN language file version doesn't match. Using default English texts for missing strings. (macro:MUI_LANGUAGEFILE_BEGIN:11)<br />
FRENCH language file version doesn't match. Using default English texts for missing strings. (macro:MUI_LANGUAGEFILE_BEGIN:11)<br />
<br />
label &quot;mui.langdll_done&quot; not used<br />
<br />
LangString &quot;MUI_BUTTONTEXT_FINISH&quot; is not set in language table of language 1036<br />
LangString &quot;MUI_BUTTONTEXT_FINISH&quot; is not set in language table of language 1031<br />
<br />
Are the language files still not complete for beta4?<br />
<br />
In the NSIS documentation:<br />
<br />
5.2.3 ${__DATE__}<br />
Date date according to the current locale.<br />
<br />
Date is twice. Please fix that.<br />
<br />
Another thing I experienced is that the general description at the components page (&quot;Hover you mouse over a component...&quot;) is grey (disabled). It become black (enabled) as soon as you position the mouse above one component. Makes no sense to me to make a label control disabled, if the text is applicable (and important).<br />
<br />
Another last question:<br />
<br />
How can I set/change the dialog title after the &quot;:&quot; in the MUI. The Welcome and the startmenu dialog has no title after the &quot;:&quot;. Please fix that!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for an answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">* Info about multiple texts has already been added to the MUI docs.<br />
<br />
* A note about langstrings has always been there. Just use a langstring instead of text.<br />
<br />
* I'll remove the double date in the docs.<br />
<br />
* The text is disabled because it is not a description. It makes it easier to see whether a description is being displayed or not.<br />
<br />
* The language system has just been changed. Most of the language files have not been updated yet.<br />
<br />
* There is no page description in the window title for the MUI. It's already in the white header. You are probably using an old version (of a few days ago) that incorrectly showed the text for a few pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your answer.<br />
<br />
Please do add a notice, that you have to use MUI_PAGE_LICENSE with an LicenseLangString instead of an LangString parameter in a multilanguage installer.<br />
<br />
I cannot get the following to work: <br />
<br />
!define MUI_LICENSPAGE_TEXT $\&quot;$(README_Bottom)$\&quot;$\&quot;$(README_Button)$\&quot;<br />
(The LangStrings README_Bottom and README_Button are correctly defined)<br />
Please provide a sample, because I don't know what's wrong with this line.<br />
<br />
The caption of the windows definitely consist out of the AppName, the version name, &quot;installer&quot;, &quot;:&quot; and a dialog specific topic like &quot;License Agreement&quot; in the license page (e.g. &quot;WinCD 2.71 Setup: License Agreement&quot;). The text in the white header is a different one. Some pages like Startmenu and Welcome does not have a topic. They only consists out of AppName, VerName and &quot;Setup&quot;. In which way will it be in the final version. Now it is a littlebit nonuniform.<br />
<br />

Please get the latest development snapshot and you will see that the MUI_LICENSEPAGE_TEXT docs and the window captions have been changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with the newest CVS, MUI_LICENSEPAGE_TEXT doesn't work. Also the window captions are like I described before. Please help me with my MUI_LICENSEPAGE_TEXT problem.<br />
Thanks in advance, Konrad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 22:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Your syntax is wrong (there is another topic about it). It has been fixed in the latest MUI docs. There is also no windows caption anymore.<br />
<br />
Use the latest development snapshots if you want to get these files. Public CVS access is 1-2 days behind: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=139427</div></div><hr />
