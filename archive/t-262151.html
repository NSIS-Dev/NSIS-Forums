It has taken flippin two days of reading thru the code to understand what it was doing and when.  It now detects everything fine and moves to do the proper install.<br />
<br />
I have one part left to figure out.  Is there a way to jump to the next section.  Say I set a variable to &quot;a&quot; and at the beginning of a section I check the variable, if true it continues down the line, if false it basically needs to skip the section.  Right now I have it going to End: which shows a complete page with a next button, I would rather it go straight to the beginning of the next section instead of End: of the current section....<br />
<br />
Right now at the beginning of the section I have this<br />
<br />
  Strcmp $DOWNLOAD_FLAG &quot;download&quot; Install End</div></div><hr />

Do you have 2 InstFiles pages or do you mean functions used on custom pages?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
<br />
and now it goes to the right starting point if JRE is installed...<br />
<br />
Id like to know WHY....just so I know.</div></div><hr />
