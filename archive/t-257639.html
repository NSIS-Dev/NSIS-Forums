How to integrate it in a CD or DVD with NSIS.<br />
Let the CD can detect that board's chipset, vga's chipset, <br />
lan chipset and then install their driver correctly.</div></div><hr />

It integrated all driver you needed to install.<br />
But i needed to detect which driver is correct to <br />
be installwith the kind of mainboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
 The CD may have many drivers like &quot;VIA chipset driver&quot;, <br />
&quot;Intel 845 or 945 chipset driver&quot;,&quot;Intel lan driver&quot;, <br />
&quot;Realtek lan driver&quot; in it.<br />
<br />
 Now i have one mainboard it use intel 945 chipset and <br />
intel lan chipset.<br />
<br />
 When i use the integrate CD it can detect the board <br />
945 driver and intel lan drivers is needed and then <br />
auto install them.<br />
<br />
Does NSIS can do this? <br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

You could write your own plug-in based on one of these, or anything else that might fit:<br />

<br />
Sorry, but this IS exactly what you need.<br />
<br />
In any case you have to make available all needed and unneeded drivers.<br />
And - there is actual (as said) no way for nsis to detect and install drivers.<br />
But Windows can do - as usual.<br />
<br />
Get practice with nLite and you will see...</div></div><hr />
