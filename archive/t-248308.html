<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">12VoltMan</div><div class="date">9th June 2006, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">In the NSIS Manual, it says &quot;Warning: when deploying DLLs, always use redistributable files. Never copy files from your system directory.&quot; <br />
<br />
Why should you not use the files from your system directory? I'm trying to recreate our badly behaving install using NSIS and it would be a lot easier to just grab what's on my system than to try to locate the redistributables. It sounds like that's not a good idea, though.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Which one are yours?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">10th June 2006, 01:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Well..most of them come with Microsoft Visual 6 Studio Service pack 6, although the installer 60 MB =\<br />
<br />
My recommendation is try to use IFileExists instruction and use at the most the installers from Microsoft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr Inches</div><div class="date">10th June 2006, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The general reason for not doing this is that the versions of the various libraries you have can vary from the standard installs. Not all of the actions the installers does may have been recorded in log you are using either, for example library registration, registry entries etc.<br />
<br />
Consider how many applications you have installed since you did the basic operating system install. Do you know exactly which version of each of the libraries you have and how they compare the 'standard' versions originally issues. Do you know what other changes were made when you installed the application that put them on your system?<br />
<br />
Consider how happy you would be if someone handed you a copy of (some of) the .NET framework files from their computer, and said 'it works OK for me' rather than an original Microsoft issued installer?<br />
<br />
If you have access to a plain vanilla installation to draw from, then you may be able to use files from there, but if you don't, it is probably safest to use the installations provide by MS (or whoever else originally provided the libraries.)<br />
<br />
As a general rule, if an original installer for the libraries exists, you are better off running it as part of your installer than trying to collect the various bits and pieces from your development system.<br />
<br />
Of course, while troubleshooting you can do whatever you think helps locate the bug, but you should consider the above when it comes to your actual installer.<br />

The &quot;why&quot; was about what I expected but I wanted to make sure there wasn't anything more sinister lurking in the shadows (so to speak).<br />
<br />
I guess I'll try to track down the actual redistributables.</div></div><hr />
