<br />
I have a bunch of games I serve up for downloads.  I would like to stamp in some information real-time when someone requests the exe.  For example, download date, affiliate code, etc.  Is there a way I can do this from a servlet?  Can I set aside a spot in the nsis install exe where I can stuff this data?<br />
<br />
Then when the installer is running, I would probably write this data to the registry.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Craig</div></div><hr />

(How you'd access the NSIS Installer exe while in setup is beyond me though =P)<br />

Feel free to contact me if you would like an elaboration or possible example, and I shall provide you with such. (I don't check the NSIS forums all too often--sorry)<br />
