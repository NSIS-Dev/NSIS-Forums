<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsfis</div><div class="date">29th November 2004, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using NSIS since version 1.4 and I am very satisfied with it. But with the arrival of open source tools for authoring of MSI packages (Wix), some questions came to my mind and I have not found answers yet. Is there anybody here in this forum who knows both NSIS and Windows installer technologies and who is able to compare them? I don't mean comparison of installer authoring (like authoring tools, script syntax, custom dialogs design etc.) but the instalation process itself. I have read that MSI uses Windows Installer service. What is the difference between installing files via this service and installing files in NSIS way? Are there any advantages of Windows Installer? Is there anything in the instalation process what NSIS cannot accomplish?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
The MSI engine needs to be installed. In modern days, is rare a user to still have Win95 nor Win98. Office 2000 uses the MSI engine, so from there wouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
NSIS decompress it self in a temp. directory, then is delete it. The MSI keeps a backup in your hard drive (C:\Config.msi).<br />
<br />
Adding more dialogs, in the MSI increase your MSI database, thing that in NSIS is verly a few bytes :)<br />
<br />
Well... a few details about MSI. Yes, MSI is a modern way to install files, but...you know Micro$oft... something is hidden :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
