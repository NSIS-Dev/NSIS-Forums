<br />
on a target PC several versions of a dll exist in different folders and I don't know the folders.<br />
<br />
How do I know which dll is currently registered = active?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">That depends on the DLL. Every DLL saves information differently or doesn't save information at all. If it's a COM DLL, you can normally find its path under HKCR\CLSID\{dll guid}\InprocServer32.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xirisone</div><div class="date">7th February 2007, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a COM-DLL, it has been registered with Regsvr32.<br />
<br />
Scenario on target-PC:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\mydll.dll<br />
c:\tools\mydll.dll       &lt;- this dll is registered=active<br />
d:\software\mydll.dll<br />
<br />
I want to find out which dll is currently active on the target PC so I can e.g. check it's version.<br />
<br />
Can I detct via NSIS which of the Dlls is currently used?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
   xiris</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">7th February 2007, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS is actually used to created installers ;) and, yes via a Process plugin you could detect if a DLL is running. This is hower not a trivial task.<br />
<br />
Better is to refrase your question I think: If we would know what ultimately you want to achieve, we could give a more detailed and helping answer.</div></div><hr />

Ok - I'll try to clarify the task. On the target PC we have several products that use a dll with a certain name.<br />
My NSIS Installer is only allowed to update a specific dll if the version is 11.22.33.44. I know the absolute path of this dll and so I can check it's version using ${GetFileVersion}.<br />
So far so good. But I also have to make sure that this dll is the one which is still used = which is still registered. If 'my' dll is no longer active and I install a new version I might break the other product's active dll which is installed in a different absolute path which I don't know.<br />
<br />
So if NSIS could tell me from the registry the path of the dll which is currently registered I could act on the save side.<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
