<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vc6</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">This may sound as a dumb question but I am somewhat puzzled by what seems a discrepancy between the documentation and what I see in my own script.<br />
<br />
The NSIS documentation reads:<br />
Uninstaller section names are prefixed with 'un.'<br />
But my script's uninstall section was mistakenly named:<br />
Section &quot;Uninstall&quot; <br />
And it still works.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I don't understand why it works.<br />
<br />
How does NSIS really find the uninstaller section?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any explanation you can provide.<br />
<br />

Now that we have an uninstall components page, we need to be able to give sections names again, which is the purpose of un. appended to the front.<br />
