<br />
You may probably know that the newest version of the http://www.7-zip.org/ archiver can open NSIS-Installer.exe files and extract data.<br />
<br />
Quoting Website: <br />
Unpacking only: RAR, CAB, ISO, ARJ, LZH, CHM, Z, CPIO, RPM, DEB and NSIS !!!<br />
<br />
I tried it - it works I can open my NSIS installers and get to the raw data :(<br />
<br />
In one of my installers I want to prevent that! Can I somehow prevent people from doing this ?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

I don't think anyone has done this before though, so it's up to you to find out how to do it or what to use.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dandaman32</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 22:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Use 7-zip to compress and encrypt your program's files at compile time, then use nsExec to execute 7zip at runtime and unpack the installer data.<br />
<br />
You may want to use a C++/VB/whatever program to generate a random 64-character or so encryption key at compile time and then have 7-zip use that key to encrypt the compressed archive. That way every copy of the installer would have a different encryption key, but compiling the installer might take a little bit longer, especially if your program is big. If you really want to go secure, make a PHP or ASP.net script that recompiles the installer each time someone orders a copy and provide them with the key, that would mean that each copy of the installer would have a different key. If you don't want users to have to enter the key themselves, you could always make your C++ program generate a simple NSH file that contains the key and then use !include to use the generated file, but this can be a bit insecure in some cases.<br />

<br />
I hoped that there is some compiler option to use compress format - not encrypted, but just not openable.<br />
I think I then leave my stuff the way it is - doing this changes is too much work and adds another layer of complexity.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 02:34</div></div><div class="posttext">For now, you can use bzip2 compression to keep 7-zip from extracting.  However, no guarantees that will continue to be the case.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
I just found a funky tool called &quot;Yoda's Protector&quot; that has some basic EXE encryption.  Unfortunately, it only seems to work from a GUI interface and can only encrypt one file at a time.  But, it's free and from my quick tests with 7-zip seems to work.  Might check it out:<br />
