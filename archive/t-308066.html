<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nobswolf</div><div class="date">8th July 2009, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the File /r command in a section and exclude several filenames. Some are exact, some are with wildcards. Finally I ask for a generic wildcard to get all files but some at the end. This works nicely.<br />
<br />
I also want to exclude directories. This worked nicely also for Eclipse- and SVN-directories like .svn . <br />
<br />
But now I need to exclude another directory including everything 'below'. And this does not work. The directory and it's contents are in the resulting installer.<br />
<br />
This is the command I use, HTDOCSclean and HTDOCSobf are the directories I want to exclude:<br />
File /r \<br />
 /x *.jpg /x *.gif /x *.png  \<br />
 /x .svn  \<br />
 /x HTDOCSclean /x HTDOCSobf  /x Thumbs.db \<br />
 /x .project /x .settings  \<br />
 &quot;*.*&quot;<br />
NSIS version is 2.45<br />
OS is XP<br />
<br />
What I am doing wrong? Can you help me please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should have noticed it is only the images that are in the unwanted directories. Those are packed in another 'File /r' that was missing the /x .<br />
<br />
sorry</div></div><hr />
