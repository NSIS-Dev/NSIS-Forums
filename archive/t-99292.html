<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">i was wondering if the following idea could be implemented in a future version of NSIS. thinking about the problem from this post (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=98492) i was wondering if you could make excluding sections in nsis2.<br />
<br />
let's say i have a subsection with two sections. the two sections are excluding each other, means only one of them can be selectedd (not both the same time).<br />
<br />
as for the problem of the link above: i'd create this as first subsection and put the sections &quot;configuration for winamp 2&quot; and &quot;configuration for winamp 3&quot;. not as elegant as the other way to support both versions, but it's less code and just one extra click.<br />
<br />
i was also thinking of this, cause i wanted to add more changes to these to configuration types (i.e. since autoexecute is no feature of winamp3 but of winamp2)<br />
