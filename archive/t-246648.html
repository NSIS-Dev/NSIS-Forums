<br />
i'm going to be distributing a client to users as they download it to their computer.  I'd like to link the client to the server using a unique identifier that will already be stored in the database (i.e. the user has already signed and stored in the db when they go to download the application).<br />
<br />
i have already used nsis to create a setup.exe that installs my application.  i am compressing it as well using the best compression.    <br />
<br />
the servers will be linux and running sql or something...<br />
<br />
i'd like the client to know what it's unique identifier is *when the user downloads the software*  <br />
<br />
my questions:<br />
1) is there a way of including the # on the fly inside the compressed .exe file..?  i.e. to have a placeholder inside the .exe that i could just textually replace on every download?<br />
2) are there any other elegant ways of doing this?  how would they work in lay man's terms? :P <br />
3) i suppose i could run the nsis thing each time the user wants to download the client, and include this special # within the applciation directory, but i'd rather not...<br />
<br />
help!<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

Even though NSIS has a $COOKIES constant for the IE cookies folder, the user may well be using other web browsers.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to temporarily store their IP address in the database. You'd need to have a server-side executable written in PHP or Perl (etc), which your installer would query with the InetLoad plugin passing the users' IP address to it.<br />
