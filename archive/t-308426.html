<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Icks92</div><div class="date">16th July 2009, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">In my NSIS I changed different colors, like the background of the branding text.<br />
<br />
But I see that some times it appears in white like I asked its, and some times it appears in grey, like its defult color. <br />
<br />
I absolutely not control that and it is very unpleasant.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know how to resolve it ? <br />
<br />
Thank you !</div></div><hr />
