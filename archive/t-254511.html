<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vitoco</div><div class="date">31st August 2006, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed a small problem with FindProc (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FindProcDLL_plug-in) plugin:<br />
<br />
I wrote an installer that requires the user to be an administrator of the machine, so it uses UserInfo to check for this on init. As this installer can update an application if it's already installed, it also checks (using FindProc) on init if the installed program is currently running and warns for that event. <br />
<br />
If the logged user is not an administrator, and has the application running, when I run the installer using &quot;Run as..&quot; option from the context menu (right-clicking over the installer) to give an administrator account, it seems that FindProc doesn't find the running application.<br />
<br />
I guess that this plugin only searches inside current user's programs list, not the machine's one.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround or fix available?<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />
<br />

The source code is distributed along with the plugin, so you can try playing around with it to see if you can get it to work.</div></div><hr />

I am running into the same deal here, except I am using the LSRUNASE program to launch an MSI and the FindProc plug-in will not find the process b/c it is being launched as the admin and not the user that is logged in.</div></div><hr />
