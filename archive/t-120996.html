<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PerditionC</div><div class="date">11th January 2003, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to use the InstallerOptions plugin, but I can't get the installer to work correctly with it.  I am using the one included with NSIS 2.0b0 but I also checked with the latest one in cvs and it behaves similarly.  I create a dialog box with a label and a combobox, this all works fine, but after I click next the buttons become disabled and nothing displays in the center status area (I have to kill the process here).<br />
In showCfgDlg() I changed the line<br />
  if (was_ok_enabled) EnableWindow(hNextButton,0);<br />
to<br />
  if (was_ok_enabled) EnableWindow(hNextButton,1);<br />
and the installer will then allow me to click next and exit the installer.  However the center status area is still not shown, so I can't see the details window nor NSISdl progress bar (I've tried with this commented out to try and make sure it wasn't effecting things).<br />
<br />
I am mostly testing using the Modern UI but similar issues occur without it (though instead of 'Next' I get a 'Close' button).<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  Is this something I did wrong, has it been fixed already, or is more information required?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Jeremy</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does NSISdl have to do with it?<br />
<br />
If you can attach the script this will all be a bit clearer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PerditionC</div><div class="date">11th January 2003, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that explains a lot.<br />
Yes I was using it in a section, right before I made a call to NSISdl (I am trying to prompt the user to select a mirror site to download from), so I wasn't initially sure which plugin may have an error (or if it was just me -- which is what it is :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks, I'll look into altering my approach then.</div></div><hr />
