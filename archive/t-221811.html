<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueHabu</div><div class="date">18th July 2005, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a somewhat large installer 330MB compress/550 uncompressed.  Using MUI the progress seems to get &quot;stuck&quot; at the point when files are being copied (around 25%) and stays there until all the files are copied (about 3 minutes) . Then it jumps to like 75% to launch a setup exe I have. Then it finishes up.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas what is going on? I would like the progress bar to move during the time files are being copied over.  I very newbish about this stuff. I just took on the installer project where i work<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">19th July 2005, 05:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is because the progress bar's maximum value is the number of commands in the install section, and as the commands are carried out the progress bar increases for each command. I have a big installer (250 uncompressed/ 50 compressed) and I noticed this on my installer. The files being copied take a while to execute but the registry commands; INI writing; executing other programs; etc... take almost no time to execute. If you put all your file commands at the end of the section (after all other commands) you will see that the progress bar will jump at the start and then it appears to stop right at the end.<br />
<br />
It's just one of those things you have to live with.<br />
One solution I can see is to put a command that takes no time to execute in between the file commands so it looks like the install is constant.<br />
<br />
I hope this info helps.</div></div><hr />
