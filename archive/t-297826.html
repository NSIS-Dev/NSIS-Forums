Anyone have a good example of section dependency using the LogicLib?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">25th September 2008, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.. I took a look at the wiki article ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Section_Dependency ) and made a LogicLib version below.<br />
<br />
There are some differences, however.. From reading the wiki, there's a comment that reads &quot;# Check if Sec2 was just selected then select Sec3 and Sec4.&quot;.  However, it doesn't actually do that in the code there.  The below LogicLib'd code does.<br />
<br />
In short, the behavior is as follows:<br />
Selecting Section 2 -&gt; Selects Section 3 and Section 4<br />
Unselecting Section 2 -&gt; Unselects Section 3 and Section 4<br />
Selecting Section 3 -&gt; Selects Section 2<br />
Selecting Section 4 -&gt; Selects Section 2<br />
<br />
To match the behavior of the wiki article code, just remove the code that selects Section 3 and Section 4 when Section 2 was selected.<br />
<br />
In addition, I have hardcoded the value of the independent section's selected state in .onInit.  The reason I've hardcoded this is because, presumably, as the author of the installer you would -know- whether your independent section ('Section 2' in the example) is selected on startup or not (made optional using &quot;Section /o&quot;), so detecting this at runtime is a bit wasteful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">max0davis</div><div class="date">25th September 2008, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you and good work Animaether! You know what would be really cool, if someone wrote a dependency library or even just a macro for dependencies... so the macro would have syntax something like this:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro DEPENDENCY ${Sec2} ${Sec3} ${Sec4}<br />
<br />
where the first param (Sec2) is the section all other following params (sections Sec3 and Sec4) are dependent on.<br />
<br />
Not even sure if that would be possible but it sure would make it simple to set up dependency trees.</div></div><hr />
