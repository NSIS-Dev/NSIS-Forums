<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xDan</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, is there any plugin or example to request the user for feedback on uninstalling the app? I.e. to ask why they uninstalled.<br />
<br />
(I guess it would post to a web form or something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xDan</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">It's ok, I think I will just open a web browser window to a webpage on uninstall, that will probably be much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">except, there is a problem with opening browsers in the uninstaller, mainly, the add/remove program window waits for every uninstaller child process</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xDan</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Really? I just tried on XP and there didn't seem to be a problem.<br />
<br />
I did use this technique: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Open_link_in_new_browser_window<br />
<br />
Which is better than plain ol' ShellExecute.</div></div><hr />

That code is both wrong and stupid, ExecShell is the correct choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, ow, use ExecShell as Anders says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xDan</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So are you going to bother to back that up with facts? Why exactly is it stupid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
ExecShell calls ShellExecute and that is correct way to open a url. Parsing the registry on your own is so error prone and not future proof.<br />
<br />
1) ReadRegStr $0 HKCR &quot;http\shell\open\command&quot; &quot;&quot; is problematic since open might not be the default verb, you would have to read HKCR &quot;http\shell&quot; &quot;&quot; first and get the default verb, if empty, use the first key found, if no keys are found, use open (this sounds weird, but thats how it is)<br />
<br />
2) This code does not handle REG_EXPAND_SZ<br />
<br />
3) Does not handle DDE, DropTarget or shellex handlers<br />
<br />
4) Breaks shellexecute hooks<br />
<br />
In short, it could start the wrong browser or not start anything at all. The specifics of ShellExecute is way to complicated for someone to emulate in a simple helper function like this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xDan</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, ok then, I didn't realise that. ShellExecute is still annoying, though, in that in some cases it will use an already open window.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not ShellExecute's fault, it depends on the end user's setup (default browser and how this browser is registered)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You could try rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler http://example.com probably not documented and might just call ShellExecute internally, I don't know<br />
<br />
edit: <br />
yeah, on XP.SP2 at least, it just calls ShellExecuteA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xDan</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks anyway. I guess this isn't really a critical situation, I can live with a few problems if they are uninstalling the software trial anyway.</div></div><hr />
