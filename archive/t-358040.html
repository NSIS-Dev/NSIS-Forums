<br />
i am using the EnvVarUpdate.nsh to set a system variable.<br />
Now I am getting the following warning:<br />
&quot;uninstall function un.EnvVarUpdate&quot; not referenced - zeroing code (179-377) out&quot;<br />
<br />
Indicating i am not calling &quot;un.EnvVarUpdate&quot; - removing that system variable during uninstallment. However for certain reasons I do not want to remove that variable. But how can i get rid of that warning without calling &quot;un.EnvVarUpdate&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
The warning does not mean that the uninstaller will remove the environment variable during uninstall. (The NSIS compiler doesn't actually understand NSIS scripts on such a level.)<br />
In fact, the warning only means that the function &quot;un.EnvVarUpdate&quot; is never *called* by your script, and therefore the function is never used. Unused functions only consume memory without ever doing anything, so the compiler just skips the function and doesn't compile it.<br />
<br />
Unused functions are perfectly fine. (After all, the only bad thing they could do is waste memory, and the compiler prevents that by skipping their code.) As long as *you* don't remove the enironment variable during uninstall, then *NSIS* will also not remove it. NSIS only does exactly what you tell it to do in the nsi script.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your answer.<br />
However I was not mistaken about the warning mabye i didn't write it clearly. As I said in my previous post (&quot;Indicating i am not calling &quot;un.EnvVarUpdate&quot; &quot;) i am not calling that function so i get that warning. There is of course no magic removal of that variable or things like that ;)<br />
<br />
My question was: How can I get rid of that warning without calling &quot;un.EnvVarUpdate&quot; in my script. I know that the warning can be ignored - however I don't want to. Thus my question is: Is there is a way to remove or surpress that warning.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
