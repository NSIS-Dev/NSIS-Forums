<br />
<br />
I have seen this problem many times by searching Google and found nothing so I coded it. (Now the irony is that I finally found about the &quot;Nopey&quot; plugin but it was too late).<br />
<br />
So here it goes.<br />
<br />
I have implemented a library to be called with the System plugin to facilitate the execution of installation code (or another program) under an administrator account.<br />
It is a bit limited for the moment but patches are welcome.<br />
<br />
More details can be found here:<br />

This code is distributed under the LGPL with an exception documented in the source code headers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">1st June 2006, 00:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever thought of building software with scons? You need the Platform SDK Server 2003 edition, Visual Toolkit 2003, Python, and scons. NSIS itself uses this for its build system. This is what I use to build all my software at home. I only use the Visual C++ IDE to edit the source code.<br />
This sure beats opening each project and compiling each one in Visual C++ separately :).<br />
<br />
I forgot to add I have read the wiki page and noticed what you build the software with, which is why I posted a reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wolfgangsourdea</div><div class="date">2nd June 2006, 05:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I still prefer not to use Visual C++ and stuff like that. GCC replaces it quite well. At least for my use. Besides I have a quite good knowledge of GCC too. The matter is not to use gratis tools, it's to use *free* tools... ;)<br />
<br />
For the rest, I don't know about them and do not have much use for them either. The tools I use generally are GCC, GNU Make and GNU Emacs, even to edit Delphi code. I love Python though and I do use it to write most of my scripts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dll is working without problem... :-) <br />
But I need 2 more features:<br />
1. Possibility to wait for program to finish.<br />
2. Something like ExecDos - to hide command window if I launch  command application.<br />
<br />
I realy don't know is it possible or not, but please try to make it. These 2 features will be realy usefull.<br />
<br />
Best wishes and thank you for great work.</div></div><hr />
