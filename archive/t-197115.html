<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jay.smith</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a java class that has a dollar sign in the name when is compiled. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas how to make the following work?<br />
<br />
File &quot;MyApp\LibMessageDigester$MyHandler.class&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanted to try to escape it with \ but that will be considered part of the path?<br />
<br />
File &quot;MyApp\LibMessageDigester\$MyHandler.class&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Any pointers greatly appreciated.<br />

Thinking about it again, it shouldn't even process the dollar sign, so there is no reason to escape it. I have just tested it and it works fine. Make sure you got the path right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jay.smith</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot that the orginal files get deleted, the installer piece works ok, complains of an undefined variable in the uninstall section with the DELETE &quot;my$StupidFile.class&quot; but the installer does build.  <br />
<br />
It doesn't remove that file during uninstall.  Thanks for you help I really appreciate you taking the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Delete line you need double dollar sign because it is parsed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jay.smith</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried that and it does not complain about the undefined variable but still doesn't remove the file at uninstall time.<br />
<br />
Thanks, I will just but it in the known issues list and roll on.  Maybe there will be a solution for it in the future.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You should specify a full path when using delete. Use:Delete $INSTDIR\my$$StupidFile.class</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, that did work changed it from C:\Program Files\cognos\crn\sdk\java\ExecReportsInstall to $INSTDIR and it started working.  Dummy me, I wasn't pointed to the install dir at all.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for humor a stupid programmer,  today I am worn out.  It's working and you were a great help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FkYkko</div><div class="date">28th January 2008, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I've got a question related to this long dead thread's discussion:<br />
<br />
I'm making an installer which will contain Java-files containing $-signs in the filename. I'm also using the <br />
Uninstall log (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Uninstall_only_installed_files). The specific macro I'm having some problems with is.<br />
<br />
; File macro<br />
!macro File FilePath FileName<br />
 IfFileExists &quot;$OUTDIR\${FileName}&quot; +2<br />
  FileWrite $UninstLog &quot;$OUTDIR\${FileName}$\r$\n&quot;<br />
 File &quot;${FilePath}${FileName}&quot;<br />
!macroend<br />
!define File &quot;!insertmacro File&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
When I add files using e.g <br />
<br />
${File} &quot;c:\Muppet$Kermit.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
it generates warnings since both the IfFileExists and FileWrite are runtime and will think $Kermit.txt is a variable and can't find it.<br />
<br />
I'm using a external script which generates these lines in an autobuild enviroment so there would not be any problem generating <br />
<br />
${File} &quot;c:\Muppet$$Kermit.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
instead, but this results in an &quot;file not found&quot; error.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to make IfFileExists and File behave the same regarding variable names?<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Is there another uninstall log which is recommended for use? (since these macros doesn't seem to have changed for a couple of years)<br />
<br />
Or do I have to rewrite these macros to change the string for the IfFileExists command? (uglyfying the code)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th January 2008, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the easiest solution in this case would be uglyfying the code.</div></div><hr />
