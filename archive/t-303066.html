<br />
My desktop shortcut icon looks fine on some machines but not so good on others - It loses clarity becoming slightly blurry.<br />
I suspect it is down to the screen resolution of each machine.<br />
<br />
The .ico dimensions are 32x32 and the file size is 4KB. I use this icon for the Desktop and Quicklaunch shortcut. I've tried making the .ico larger to 48x48 but to no avail.<br />
<br />
In terms of the .ico how do you get it to look really crisp. Ideally we would have vector graphics which scale up without any loss, however, .ico are raster images and once scaled up lose quality (e.g. pixelated) which doesn't help.<br />
<br />
Any ideas anyone?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

<br />
have you tried vector magic (http://vectormagic.com/) yet? it doesn't always produce good results, but you can usually proceed from there.</div></div><hr />
