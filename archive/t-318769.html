<br />
I want to create a installer in which once user enters the credentials in the user configuration page, basically user name, access key and the url. Now with the help of web service check the authentication of the user and if the authentication is correct then only allow user to go ahead with rest of the installation process. I want to create this installation for my Microsoft Outlook Exchange server add-on. Hope i am making sense. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">29th April 2010, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">have a look at the inetc plugin:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in<br />
<br />
It supports both http get and http post and both http and https (if you want to make it s a secure connection)<br />
<br />
as long as your web server can return the &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;NOT OK&quot;, you should be good to go from there.<br />
<br />
A very simplistic version might use http get, with the server generating a simple text file response, which you can then parse further with NSIS</div></div><hr />

BTW if possible can you share an example. the web server returns the response in json. what can i do with that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">29th April 2010, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS doesn't have a JSON parser at current but you are welcome to write one. It could be done in NSIS script or as a plug-in (looks like there is plenty of implementations you can use, such as in C).<br />
<br />
If possible though you want to change the output to say XML or perhaps a simple INI file which you can then parse using existing techniques.<br />
