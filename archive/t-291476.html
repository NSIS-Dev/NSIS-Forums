<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coolblu77</div><div class="date">8th May 2008, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
I'm obviously missing something, i can't get the AccessControl plugin to work.<br />
<br />
I'm using Vista, running as an admin user with the UAC turned on.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to make a file have generic read and generic write access for all users, or maybe just full acccess.<br />
<br />
I've tried the line:<br />
AccessControl::GrantOnFile &quot;$strMachineIniPath&quot; &quot;(S-1-1-0)&quot; &quot;GenericRead + GenericWrite&quot; <br />
But this gives me an error when I compile, am I missing something such as including the dll or something?<br />
I've copied the AccessControll.dll to the same directory as my install script (nsi and ini's).<br />
<br />
<br />
After reading up on how to use a dll I've tried:<br />
System::Call 'AccessControl.dll::GrantOnFile(t .&quot;$strMachineIniPath&quot;, t .&quot;(S-1-1-0)&quot;, t .&quot;FullAccess&quot;)'<br />
This compiles but does not seem to do what I wanted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also does a return value get pushed? I tried pop $r1, it had &quot;success&quot; in it, was that from this call or left over from a previous function call?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated, I've been reading the forums all morning and still dont see what I'm doing wrong.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Coolblu77.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew it would be something simple like that, I'm sure I read that NSIS looks in the current directory as well as those defined for plugins, but maybe not.<br />
<br />
Anyway thats working now.<br />
<br />
And I can see that it is returning a response on the stack.<br />
<br />
<br />
One other question, I'm setting the Security Access Controls for a directory just after its been created, I was hoping that any files copied to that directory would inherit the settings of the directory, but they dont seem to be.<br />
<br />
Do I need to call EnableFileInheritance or anything?<br />
Or am I just going to have to call GrantOnFile for each file?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm now calling AccessControl::GrantOnFile for the directory, after I've copied over the files that need to inherit, this seems to work.</div></div><hr />
