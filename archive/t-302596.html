<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smarmit</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all:<br />
<br />
On all my MUI2 pages I set the header and sub-header text to blank (&quot;&quot;). I do this depending on the page, but my particular problem is for the uninstall finish page. For my install finish page I define:<br />
<br />
!define MUI_INSTFILESPAGE_FINISHHEADER_TEXT &quot;&quot;<br />
!define MUI_INSTFILESPAGE_FINISHHEADER_SUBTEXT &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
This works as expected and no text is shown. However, I do not see in the MUI2 documentation an uninstall counterpart and my other &quot;tricks&quot; were unsuccessful. I keep getting text on the final uninstall finish page.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know a way to remove text from the uninstall finish page?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Scott</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Those defines are for the instfiles page, not the finish page. The finish page defines are MUI_FINISHPAGE_TITLE and friends.<br />
<br />
But if you were indeed referring to the instfiles page, those should work for the uninstaller too and work fine for me. Have you defined MUI_UNFINISHPAGE_NOAUTOCLOSE as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smarmit</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi: Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
To clarify, I'm referring to the uninstall page at the end where the user can click &quot;Close&quot; to complete un-installation, or &quot;Show Details&quot;. I do have this set:<br />
<br />
!define MUI_UNFINISHPAGE_NOAUTOCLOSE<br />
!insertmacro MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES<br />
<br />
So as details are going by, &quot;deleting this, deleting that...&quot; there is no text next to my image at the top of the uninstall page. As soon as it's completed and the the &quot;Close&quot; button becomes active, then some text shows up that says:<br />
<br />
&quot;Uninstall Complete&quot;<br />
&quot;Uninstall completed successfully.&quot;<br />
<br />
At least that's what I think it says as it is partly cut-off by my left-hand side image. That's the text I don't want.<br />
<br />
And lastly, on my *install* page equivalent which also has NOAUTOCLOSE set, there is no extra unwanted text. I believe this setting takes care of that:<br />
<br />
!define MUI_INSTFILESPAGE_FINISHHEADER_TEXT &quot;&quot;<br />
!define MUI_INSTFILESPAGE_FINISHHEADER_SUBTEXT &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words, I *think* I would need something like:<br />
<br />
!define MUI_UNINSTFILESPAGE_FINISHHEADER_TEXT &quot;&quot;<br />
!define MUI_UNINSTFILESPAGE_FINISHHEADER_SUBTEXT &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
... notice the &quot;UN&quot; prefix. I know those don't exist so I don't know how to get rid of that final text.<br />
<br />
I hope that all made sense.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Simply define them before inserting the MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES macro and after inserting MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES,</div></div><hr />
