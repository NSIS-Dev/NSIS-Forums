<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaszbo</div><div class="date">23rd November 2002, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to detect if OpenGL is installed and if not it will automatically install the files needed.  <br />
<br />
Also is there anway to detect for .net framework?  I know that ms installer will check if there is .net installed and if not it will run dotnetfx.exe, but I would like any way to detect if .net is installed and if not it will run this app.  So when I compile .nsi I would include the dotnetfx.exe. I just have no clue on how to do this and would appreciate any help.</div></div><hr />

I don't quite understand what files exactly you want for OpenGL... AFAIK every graphics card has different OpenGL drivers, and you can't just driver that will handle them all. There is a program that comes with Q3A that is supposed to install the latest OpenGL drivers for you. It's called GLSetup, but it's pretty much dead now, last news item on their website is from September 17th, 2001...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaszbo</div><div class="date">24th November 2002, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">your right most will have opengl already, but in case they don't. I would like to install<br />
you can go to opengl.org and download the files.  They are to be extracted into your system directory. <br />
I'll looking at the post you posted about .net now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaszbo</div><div class="date">24th November 2002, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the link. I just wasn't able to get anything done though.  I mean unless I used their installer, but I would pefer to use NSIS</div></div><hr />

I have 120 page paper on groups project and I wrote 10 pages on the benifits of NSIS.  So I have to get this to work.<br />
I found out that I can do a silent install, which will install and then do a check, so if there's a way I can include this it would be nice<br />
<br />
dotnetfx /q:a /c:&quot;install /q&quot; <br />
<br />
Just not sure how I would put this in the nsi <br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />

Try doing a check to see if the windows\Microsoft.net\framework directory exists...if it doesn't then run the dotnetfx /q:a /c:&quot;install /q&quot; command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">To execute a program use Exec, ExecWait or nsExec (only with the latest version from the CVS).<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\MyProg.exe&quot; bla.blo'<br />
<br />
I wrote 10 pages on the benifits of NSIS. So I have to get this to work.<br />
<br />
Any chance we'll get to see it? :D<br />
<br />
And about OpenGL, quoted from the download page on OpenGL.org:<br />
You do need an OpenGL hardware driver for your particular 3D hardware accelerator board.</div></div><hr />

it seems to be working great now.<br />
just have to finish other things on the project now.  One more question.  Does anybody have a list of popular software that uses NSIS? I would like to add it in my documentation for the project<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />
