Is there some kind of way to geotarget so it will show that screen only for US users?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">12th April 2011, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not a question about NSIS installer coding. If you need help with programming your application, you'll have to ask elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Hmm, maybe I misunderstood your question. If you want to get the country the installer is run in, there are several ways to go about it, but I don't think any of them is foolproof or even good to use. Try googling for 'windows get country'. You can use the system plugin to call windows API commands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was looking over the plugins and maybe the IP Plugin will work in this instance?  <br />
<br />
I would just need an IP database of some sort for the plugin to lookup and determine the end user's location.<br />
<br />
Whatcha think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">12th April 2011, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Using reverse DNS lookup is extremely unreliable, even more unreliable than, say, calling GetLocalInfoEx. Also, reverse DNS requires an internet connection, and the user will probably get a warning from the firewall software. I don't think you'll want this.<br />
<br />
There's no real way of doing what you want. Any solution you'll end up using will be 1) unreliable, 2) easy to crack, and 3) probably very annoying to your users. I strongly (VERY strongly) suggest you rethink your installation strategy.</div></div><hr />
