exellent compression ratio, better than *zip, rar, etc., free library from Microsoft ...<br />
for example Ghost Installer use it.</div></div><hr />

3) NSIS doesn't want to be a Ghost Installer clone. Just because they have it, doesn't mean that NSIS needs to have it. The bzip2 compression would help create smaller installers.<br />

so ... thanks for welcome :) <br />
<br />
sure, NSIS doesn't want to be GIns clone, NSIS already InnoSetup(or many other installers) clone, because both use zlib compression :D <br />
you have exellent logic :D - because all other installers use GUI, NSIS dont want to have it. NSIS must have work under b&amp;w txtmode command prompt :p ...<br />
<br />
and sorry for my ugly english ...</div></div><hr />

NSIS has much lower footprint (smaller) and supports more complex instructions AFAIK. :)</div></div><hr />
