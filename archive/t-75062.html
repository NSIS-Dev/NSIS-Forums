I cant make a good icon in 16 bit color!! How long has super vga been out?? Isnt it time you guys atleast let us use 256 color icons atleast! Is there some kind of problem thats keeping you from being able to use higher color icons :igor: :weird: :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tresni</div><div class="date">10th February 2002, 22:27</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know there is no problem that keeps them from doing it.  It's something much simpler actually.  Something called file size.  The more colors your icon has the more space it's going to take up (compressed or not)  So by limiting it to 16 colors by default this will make for the smallest possible executable.  And though the super VGA has been out for a while that doesn't mean everyone is using it.  There are still those who choose to stick with older technologies and what not.  So if you want  256 colors get the source and do a search in the forum.  This topic has been brought up before and people have even said how to change it!</div></div><hr />

Poor argument :)<br />
Let the difference of file size be about 1-2 KB - what that compared with an over all size of a few hundret KB for the data to install?<br />
I think the creator of the installer should decide wether to use an 16- or 256-color icon.<br />

...and do it again for every update of makeNSIS?<br />
Not really an efficient way, isnt it?</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should comment my arguments instead of repeating yourself :)<br />

I didnt meant to tease anyone here. Just read my arguments instead of guessing.</div></div><hr />

Let's compare an icon really quick.  For ease of argument I'll use the default NSIS icon.  File size of the NSIS icon in 16 colors: 766 bytes, file size of the same icon in 256 colors: 2.92 kilobytes!  That means just by bumping the colors up to 256 you almost quadrople the file size!  Okay, you say 3kb ain't huge, but when you are making installers that are less the 35 kilobytes like I do, 3 kilobytes is a lot!  So if you want your 256 color icons, edit the source cause I don't need it :p</div></div><hr />

Two things:<br />
1. Does the possibility of using 256 color icons excludes the possibility of using 16 color icons? Technically speakting, I would say &quot;no&quot;. So if you want to use little icons and the initiator of this thread (that wasnt me ;) wants to use big icons, why makeNSIS cant make both of you happy?<br />
<br />
2. In which context &quot;3KB is a lot&quot;? I mean, if you create 35KB installers, they will be downloadable even with a 2.4K modem - nice, but a 37KB installer will be also...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">THe problem is replacing the icon in the resource section of the exe.<br />
Once you get to 256 colour icons, they are not linear icon resources, as it is a resource of multiple icons.<br />
<br />
1. Some may not have 256 colour displays.<br />
   Thus, all exes would have to have both.<br />
2. I did write a hack for NSIS that allowed both a 16 &amp; 256 colour (it took the first icons from the icon resource file). Some people would not need the 256 colour but because when the ptr to the data is found, it is just to a malloc'ed section in memory--the new one is just copied straight over the top. There is no relocation or resizing of data within the resource sector.</div></div><hr />

Do you really think so? :igor:<br />
Even Windows 95 looks ugly in &lt;= 256 colors...<br />
<br />
<br />

I didnt had a look into the exe creation code yet - it is created as a constant then?<br />
In this case it would probably a good idea to add the desired icon as a file, unpack it at startup, load it then via Win32 functions and set it as the application icon.I made this for one of my projects, because our customers wanted to see their corporate logo.</div></div><hr />

What i really meant to say was that Smarty has a good point about the file sizes but subjecting all of us to that change is unfair. I think??:weird: Because thats kind of the whole idea behind NSIS (to keep it small). And if you want IT then edit the source add IT your self, it's not hard. <br />
<br />
Oh and something for the thread starter: When you post a thread like that stated the way you did there a going to be senior mems who already don't like the thread without even reading it. It's nicer to ask. Also a better way to get something added.</div></div><hr />

I thought that the main aim of NSIS is to be better than e.g. InstallShield (which is already true;))<br />
For my personal use, I dont need &gt;= 16 color icons, so i will surely not implement something like that to makeNSIS.<br />

Thats completely right. I have read his posting only because there was a download in progress and I needed something to do...</div></div><hr />
