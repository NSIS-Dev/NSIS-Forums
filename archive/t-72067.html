<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 00:17</div></div><div class="posttext">This release is only for placing and resizing controls, you have to write all other parameters yourself (shouldn't be too hard).<br />
<br />
This program will let you create, move, and resize the controls supported by InstallOptions.  It will also generate a .INI script file that InstallOptions uses to make the window.<br />
<br />
It also comes with the source code. :cool:<br />
<br />
Please read the readme.txt for more information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 03:08</div></div><div class="posttext">hey is there any reason why you didnt just do button = 1 so that you could left click drag? i tryed it and it worked fine for me... right click dragging just doesnt seem natural in this type of situation...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">the right click dragging is a shitty remnat from the other version, where left click loaded the stats and right click dragged.<br />
<br />
you can post a recompiled version with your name in the credz, or i will later tonite.<br />
<br />
cya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">it is by far not a big enough change for me to put my name on it... its all your work that was just a suggestion. go ahead and post your recompiled version ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">aside from that, is the program OK?  do you find it useful?  does it export scripts correctly?<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 00:30</div></div><div class="posttext">waiting for some more feedback...come on guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">hi. this was a very good idea, to make such a program. it works fine (i think) but the colors are horrible :igor: why don`t you do such an interface like an normal installation? so the user will see the &quot;final&quot; product - how would it looks (hope you understand what i`m talking about)<br />
<br />
   cheers, trace ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">19th January 2002, 02:13</div></div><div class="posttext">make it simulate the NSIS window exactly?<br />
<br />
i will make the colors better :)<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">19th January 2002, 04:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice.<br />
<br />
How do you remove a control once it has been placed? *poke*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">19th January 2002, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">first : fine to have a ui designer<br />
<br />
but :<br />
<br />
now it comes.<br />
the drag n drop feature isnt very good<br />
it would be better to make it like in any other ui designer<br />
click on the control that u want then move the mouse to the position on the form and then click on the position where u want it to place<br />
<br />
like delphi, vc++ ...<br />
<br />
the interface of the programm ...<br />
ok but it would be better to drag the positions directly not with the textboxes on the bottom.<br />
<br />
i'll find some more ...<br />
<br />
although its nice for a first try on a designer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th January 2002, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please add an option to resize with the mouse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">19th January 2002, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">there is no way to remove a control :P yikes!<br />
<br />
i'll try to make it like vc++ or delphi<br />
<br />
i will also try to add the corner resizing thing :)<br />
<br />
cya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prodangle</div><div class="date">21st January 2002, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a very nice tool, I agree with most of the above posts though.  It doesn't look too great, standard Window colours would be nicer, and right-click dragging isn't very intuitive (with the last version I didn't even realise that controls could be dragged :D :D ).  Resize with the mouse would be nice too.  Looks like I got here too late though, and you've probably done all of these things already ;) <br />
Everything else I can think of is spot on IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcgarrah</div><div class="date">22nd January 2002, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having trouble with controls being placed where I want them on the screen.  They always jump to the left about half a control length.  Am I missing something like a snap-to-grid feature?<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mc^^^^</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 03:25</div></div><div class="posttext">can someone write a tutorial for this, i dont know how to put it in my .nsi and how i can have a checkbox do a certain thing when its ticked. and nothing when its not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 21:47</div></div><div class="posttext">i will also fix this control placement bug.<br />
<br />
a readme should come with the next release.</div></div><hr />
