<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John P.</div><div class="date">28th October 2005, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always wanted to ask this but never got around to it:<br />
<br />
I was wondering if it's possible to run the script through the same process that goes on in makeNSISW compiler, but without actually compiling the .exe file? Just get the report at the end, or get an error if something's wrong?<br />
<br />
The reason I'd like that is that when I compile a script now, sure enough if there is an error in the script, the compile process will halt, BUT sometimes I'd just like to test the script itself, and if it turns out there's nothing wrong with the script, then the compiler will go on to compile the .exe (obviously!).<br />
<br />
The problem there is that with some of my installers it can take more than ten minutes to compile, because of the time it takes to compress the files. And it's a pain to have to wait for that, when I really didn't want to compile it at this stage, I just wanted to see if there were any clear errors in the script.<br />
<br />
So is there something I can do to just test the script for errors without compiling it into an .exe?</div></div><hr />

It won't test compressing the files, but it'll compile much faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-I'll try that. :)</div></div><hr />

!error &quot;&quot;And ultimate solution is to add this to end of the makensis commandline.&quot;/X!verbose 0&quot; &quot;/X!error ''&quot;</div></div><hr />
