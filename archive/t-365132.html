<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmichae3</div><div class="date">1st July 2013, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">many of the syntax items (if not all) have 0-height &quot;textboxes&quot; with scrollbars on them so you can't see the syntax. as it turns out, those are XHTML pre tags. somehow, those are getting I think some sort of CSS problem with overflow: or something.<br />
for example CopyFiles, Files<br />
if I could just see the style.css I could maybe debug this.<br />
my default browser is not IE10, but firefox, on windows 7. don't ask me to change browsers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmichae3</div><div class="date">1st July 2013, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">chm. I did a view source on it to try to debug it as best I could - at least I could see the syntax that way - as long as a person can read XHTML/HTML.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmichae3</div><div class="date">3rd July 2013, 00:51</div></div><div class="posttext">what's happening is that if the help window is too small, the scroll bars show on the pre tags, and the vertical scroll bar ends up with too little space, so it doesn't show.<br />
<br />
it is possible this is something you can't fix. don't know. pre tags on my web pages can cause scroll bars on the browser, however, it is unknown to me if the html help application is capable of displaying scroll bars or not at the bottom.<br />
<br />
it's also possible the best and only solution is to simply resize the window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">3rd July 2013, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">if you're talking about what you see in the attached screenshot, i'm getting this for the old 2.46 docs as well (could be my viewer though!)<br />
<br />

<br />
this hardly deserves being called a &quot;solution&quot;<br />
<br />
on a side-note, i never understood why open source software would support a proprietary, though reverse-engineered format like .chm. the functionality of the windows help viewer can easily be replicated in html (solutions are plenty!) i hate installing a chm-viewer whenever i'm not on windows. since nsis can be compiled on non-windows platforms, a non-windows manual makes sense! a non-compiled html documentation can be viewed offline on every platform without the need of extra software.<br />
<br />
also, i'd like to mention that the official online documentation is not up-to-date. updating it to 3.0a0 is probably a better choice than using a manual that lists commands that aren't used by any stable version or the alpha (e.g. TargetMinimalOS.)</div></div><hr />

When building you can generate chm and html docs at the same time if you want (Multiple pages or single page html). The docs are in the format used by the halibut generator and it could probably generate pdf and rtf if you really wanted to as well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">4th July 2013, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm well aware of the halibut generator, but still .chm is a rather closed format. a personal favourite of mine would be markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), though even more than for a manual it's an ideal format for 3rd party addon developers. writing a proper documentation is often the part where developers get lazy and having to write two versions (distributed and wiki) doesn't help it. markdown is very readable in plain-text and there are many ways to render them in the browser to html, or use it for cms platforms and even wikis.<br />
<br />
anyway, there are currently four versions of the nsis documentation: distributed chm, the html scripting reference on sf.net, the wiki and also github-hosted markdown. there are plenty of choices. unfortunately, not all are on the same level, which is something that should be looked into in the future (i've been testing out several things already, more to come!)</div></div><hr />
