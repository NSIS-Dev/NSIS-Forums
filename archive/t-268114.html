<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zethris</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The strange part is, is that it is only extracting to one folder amongst multiple folders that is extracted. I even recreated the folder and it still extracts desktop.ini and thumbs.db to that one folder for some reason. <br />
<br />
Why is this? Where in the heck is it coming from? <br />
<br />
Is it because the folder starts out empty? <br />
<br />
<br />
Section -Main SEC0001<br />
    SetOutPath $INSTDIR ;files to be extracted and placed in folder upon install<br />
    SetOverwrite on<br />
    File /r 'File Service*' ;within this folder has the \upload\ directory that should be empty but has desktop.ini and thumbs.db extracted to it for some reason.<br />
    File /r 'Utilities*'<br />
    File /r 'CommonData*'<br />
    File /r 'HttpFileClient*'<br />
    ;Sleep 1000<br />
    !insertmacro ReplaceInFile &quot;$INSTDIR\File Upload Service\Config.xml&quot; &quot;__ID__&quot; &quot;$ID_NUMBER&quot;<br />
    WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;${REGKEY}\Components&quot; Main 1<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
I make no call to the desktop except creating a shortcut icon to it and changing the shortcut icon to a custom icon located in the \File Service\ Folder. Is this why? <br />
<br />
How can I make sure those files are not there?</div></div><hr />

They're located in the folders you extract and are therefore extracted as well. Use /x to skip them.File /x desktop.ini /x thumbs.db 'some folder\*'</div></div><hr />

<br />
That /x is good to know for other uses too. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
