<br />
I've checked everywhere and am surprised not to be able to find the answer to what must be a common problem.<br />
<br />
I am installing a program, and want to check if the program is already running.  If it is, obviously I won't be able to update it with a new version, so I want to pop open a window telling them to exit it first.<br />
<br />
I could set overwrite mode to &quot;try&quot; and use &quot;IfErrors&quot; afterwards, but the copy might have failed for some other reason (need admin permissions, for example).<br />
<br />
I looked at FindWindow, but the title changes, and the class seems to change too.<br />
<br />
If only &quot;File&quot; did more than just set an error flag.  I need to know what the error was.  If it was a file-in-use error, then the program is probably already running.  If it is a permission thing, then they probably need to log on as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Any ideas out there?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rob.</div></div><hr />

You can download it from here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=575&amp;instances=0,32).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am looking at the description of the plugin, and I have a question for you:  If $R0 = '1', then were can I find the window handle in order to send it a WM_CLOSE message?  Thanks!<br />
<br />

If you want it to gracefully shutdown, use the FindWindow instruction to get the window handle before sending the WM_CLOSE message.</div></div><hr />
