<br />
Anwyay, the real reason I came to the forum was to ask you to contact me directly by email so I can contact you back. I have already started to work on NSIS:SG, mainly cosmetic stuff (I am good with interfaces) and cleaning up the source code and project files.<br />
<br />
So Deep-Trouble please email me at paul@pawsoft.co.uk so I can get your email address.</div></div><hr />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

   Thanks for starting up early on this project.  The code as you can see is a bit too ugly, hope you can easily clean this all up so that other developers dont get confused and can easily contribute the code.  Rest in mail ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PabUK</div><div class="date">21st April 2001, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I am indeed tidying up the project (giving meaningful names to everything, slightly improved code layout). I just wanted to confirm it here so nobody else starts doing the same thing. I will soon be able to upload what I have done so far to Sourceforge so other devs will find it easier to work with than the first release.</div></div><hr />
