<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LIGHTNING UK!</div><div class="date">27th February 2006, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
For a bit of background info, I have the basic v2.14 of NSIS installed and then I usually download the CVS nightly build and overwrite the files in the NSIS folder.<br />
<br />
I've found that because the CVS text files don't have the proper CR/LF combos, the installers created don't work properly under Windows 98.<br />
<br />
I use the modern ui in my installer and the picture that's supposed to be on the left of the welcome/finish screen doesn't show up - nor does the 'Welcome to...' text at the top.<br />
Both show up fine under later OS's like XP.<br />
<br />
File by file, I copied a working base version of 2.14 over an updated CVS version, until it started working again.<br />
<br />
In the end, it was the 'ioSpecial.ini' file in the 'Contrib\Modern UI' that seemed to be causing the problem.<br />
<br />
So is there a way of either making the CVS files contain those proper CR/LF combos or making the makensis (or whatever) deal with files that don't contain them?<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

Server side languages apart from ASP (because it is Microsoft) tend to read \r\n new lines correctly but unless you force write \r\n for new lines, it will use \n instead (as it is UNIX.)<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is the same case here, but I have had this problem in the past (when web programming).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LIGHTNING UK!</div><div class="date">27th February 2006, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I just thought it was a little weird that the all the text files in the CVS nightly.zip have this cr/lf problem and none of the 'final/release' version ones do.<br />
<br />
I would have assumed they'd both be packaged up in roughly the same way - only the release one obviously has an installer.<br />
<br />
I was hoping that whatever packages up the nightly.zip file can be told to use cr/lf so it doesn't cause problems for us Windows users!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th February 2006, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Final versions are packaged on Windows, the nightly ZIP is packaged on a Linux. By default, CVS uses just LF on Linux and CR/LF on Windows. I couldn't find a way to make non-Windows CVS client to use CRLF, so, for now, I've added a manual step to convert all INI files to CRLF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So from now on (or tomorrow night at least), I should be ok to use the nightly CVS one?<br />
<br />
Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />
