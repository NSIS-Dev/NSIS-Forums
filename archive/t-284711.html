<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Protagonist</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I need an installer for Windows XP / Vista which offers the option to install for current user / all users. It is no problem under Windows XP, all i have to do is alter setshellvarcontext accordingly (I know that this is not 100 % correct as I theoretically need to alter the uninstall info etc, but as most people are logged in as admins anyway it suits me fine)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=282529) I found some good hints what I have to do for the installer to function properly under Vista<br />
<br />
What I could not quite grasp was if you are locked in as an admin and want to install for the current user only. Does the UAC plugin cover that ?<br />
<br />
Oh, and if anybody has already coded an installer with the abovementioned feature I would be very happy to take a look at that piece of code.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance. <br />

You'd simply have to wait until the user selects the installation type before you use it to execute the installer again as an administrator.</div></div><hr />
