<br />
<br />
I created 2 nsis installers(which work great btw): one for windows 32 and one for windows 64. Because they contain the same program, they have a lot of files in common (pdf's, etc..). Is there a simple way to make a kind of common install file, so when I put the 2 installers on one CD, they can both use one file for their common parts. I read about multivolume installations with cab files but this seems very complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">28th January 2009, 11:36</div></div><div class="posttext">CAB is pretty simple, actually.. just stick the common files in the CAB, and extract them with the CAB plugin to the appropriate location in each installer.<br />
<br />
You don't have to use CAB, btw - you could stick them on the CD 'as is' and just use CopyFile instead.<br />
<br />
Yet another option is to make the 32bit vs 64bit installer the same exe and let it determine itself whether it should install 32bit or 64bit (and/or provide the user the option to choose, pre-selecting the appropriate one based on OS capabilities)... that would require some rewriting in your install script though (merging both together).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilmephisto</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering if cab files have problems when using the same cab file on windows xp 32, 64 and vista 32, 64. Do you have any suggestion with which program I would create the cab to have no problems with nsis? I also thought of using a zip file, since this seems more stable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">30th January 2009, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">nah, doesn't matter.. a CAB is basically just an archive format, just like ZIP, so it truly doesn't care whether your host system is 32bit, 64bit, XP, Vista or '7'.<br />
<br />
It has some advantages over ZIP files (longer paths allowed, for example - but that shouldn't be an issue for an installer anyway), and some disadvantages (not really a common format for typical archiving - usually only used by installers.. but hey look at that, what's what NSIS is for :) ), of course.<br />
<br />
Both CAB and ZIP can be handled by NSIS plugins, or you could use a command-line tool.</div></div><hr />
