<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilb</div><div class="date">12th April 2004, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I am repackaging some .msi some data files, and a setup.exe file, and trying to create one installer to extract all these files into a temp directory, run the setup.exe, and then delete the temporary files once done.  I have gotten pretty much everything to work except for two things.  First, Once it is done extracting the files into $temp and runs the setup.exe it says finished installing &quot;installed program's name&quot; and then it has a check box that says run &quot;ipn&quot;, however if that is clicked it THEN installs the application.<br />
Second, after it is done installing the application, it leaves the files located in the $temp directory unless I tell it to include an uninstaller then I can go into add/remove programs and remove the temporary files.<br />
My two questions are 1. Is there a way automatically start the install once the files are extracted into a temp locations without the check box?, and 2. Is there a way to delete all the files stored in the $temp directory after it is finished installing the program?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) Use the plug-ins directory ($PLUGINSDIR after calling InitPluginsDir). It will automatically be deleted when the installer quits.</div></div><hr />
