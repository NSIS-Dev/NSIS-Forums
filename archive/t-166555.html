<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">25th January 2004, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Bug: MakeNSISw.exe - When I &quot;update &gt;&gt;&quot; a symbol, and when I &quot;delete&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; it, it continues with enabled buttons &quot;Edit &lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot;, even if don't have any symbol defined.<br />
<br />
Question: Have a way to define a value of a variable without pointing to the variable, like !define MyDefine $MyVar but just getting the variable text from the variable and turning it into a constant?<br />
<br />
Question: Have a way to put the string &quot;${StrStr}&quot; without converting it to a constant, and returning the text constant when having something defined with &quot;StrStr&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">25th January 2004, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is it possible to execute functions on compile-time? if not, could u include a function like .onCompileStart and .onCompileEnd, or something like that?<br />
<br />
my problem is, that i want the installer to set some strings automatically at compile-time, by reading out the filenames in directories and other things.<br />
but i dont know any way to do so. i tried it with a macro, but it always says, that the commands are valid outside a section or function :eek: .<br />
<br />
yes, i could harcode those strings, but i don't want to :D<br />
and it would be uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
possible Bug: '!echo &quot;123&quot;' shows '123 (X:\y\z.nsi:0)' where '2' is the number of the line containing the '!echo' command. if it's not a bug, ok, but i don't like it, coz it has nothing to do with copy-right messages or similar :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defines are parsed on compile-time. It has nothing to do with run-time variables. You can just declare a variable and use StrCpy to set it's value to the value of another variable.<br />
<br />
It is not possible to add your own commands. Support for compiler plug-ins will be available in the future (probably NSIS 2.1).<br />
<br />
Executing run-time commands on compile-time is not possible, because the compiler and installer VM are completely different things. You can use header files or let an application create them for you (using !system).<br />
<br />
It is normal that the compiler shows the filename and line for echo, warning and error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">25th January 2004, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, ok, i understand.<br />
but it would be a very interesting feature for nsis, to execute script-code at compiletime.<br />
<br />
and what do u mean should i do with header-files? i want to set the description of some sections dynamicaly by the content of some folders, only existing on compile-time.<br />
is this possible in any way?<br />
<br />
and i said already, that it isn't very comfortable to hardcode these descriptions.</div></div><hr />
