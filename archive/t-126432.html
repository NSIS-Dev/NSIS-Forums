<br />
I would like to know that whether there is possible or not for using user own defined user varibles instead of using of $0-$9 and $R0 - $R9 NSIS's variables. Because I need more user varibles to declare and hope that I can declare myself to make it more meaningful. <br />
<br />
Can anyone give me of guide line or advise. Thanks!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Push $0<br />
Push $1<br />
# use $1 and $0 here...<br />
Pop $1<br />
Pop $0<br />
# $0 and $1 are same as before the push now<br />

!define myConstant '4.3'<br />
<br />
This might release some variables that you used up to this time for eg the version number. Besides that, writing parts of your installer in a function that doesn't user variables (by putting the original values on stack and retrieving them afterwards) might help. See the example of deguix.<br />

Good luck,<br />

<br />
!define NumberOfFiles $R3<br />
<br />
You would reference this as<br />
<br />
Pop ${NumberOfFiles}<br />
<br />
StrCpy ${NumberOfFiles} $R0<br />
<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Files = ${NumberOfFiles}&quot;<br />
<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you've stated yourself, the &quot;variables&quot; defined by &quot;define&quot; would become constants; has there been any thoughts of the possibility of free &quot;usernamed&quot; variables ? Would it hard to program ? What are the challenges (there must be some since it hasn't been made yet ;-)...<br />
