<br />
I have a question about changing access rights to files I install through NSIS.  Our software has a few ini files that get accessed and changed with every use of the different programs.  When I install these ini files through NSIS they have some initial default settings.  What happens is the software always gets installed through an Administrator account and these files get added.  But when a user with a limited account uses the software it will not allow the ini files to be updated, throwing an error about &quot;unable to write to....&quot;  Is there a means of giving these files the proper permissions on install so anybody can change them?<br />
<br />
I apologize if this is easy one (it seems it might be), but after looking and searching for a while, I haven't come up with the solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help...<br />
<br />

It seems to work nicely.  However, if there is a more elegant solution, I wouldn't mind using it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
