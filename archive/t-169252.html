<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net<br />
<br />
however, sf.net is down every now and then. posting about that here will have no influence on that. so just be patient in future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;the amount of bandwidth we have here at aol, when you add it up, is really quite a lot. i mean, it's rather unfathomable really. it's just plain ludicrous. and we give most of it away, which is even funnier. you really can't get your head around just how unbefuckingmindbogglingly huge it is. more than pretty much anything you can comprehend. it's just that big.&quot;<br />
<br />
afterall nsis is more or less nullsoft.</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to find another good host.</div></div><hr />

It can't handle all of the projects that use it, and it slows down the HTTP server too. SF do have plans to upgrade their server, add a few more and integrate some load balancing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We get about 250,000 pageviews a month. I don't know exactly how much datatraffic that is, but it will be several gigabytes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inthegray</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking to register a domain name and getting some hosting space for Winamp Unlimited in the near future. I'd be more than willing to share the space with the NSIS development team, free of charge. If you wanted your own independent domain name instead of winampunlimited.com, you could probably cheaply purchase your own and have it forward itself to my hosting servers, so you don't have to pay monthly fees.<br />
<br />
Most likely, I will have 10 GB of bandwitdh at my disposal. I don't expect to use over 1 GB of that. If you think you can operate with a 9 GB per month restriction, feel free to contact me so we can talk about this more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, but 9 GB is quite limited and sharing accounts is not a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inthegray</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to hear I couldn't help. I wish you luck anyways on finding a Sourceforge alternative.</div></div><hr />
