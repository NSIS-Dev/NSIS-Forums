<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KRFournier</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still using Visual C++ 6.0. Does anyone have any experience writing plugins in this environment, and if so, how did you debug them? My guess is that I need to debug the extracted installer, but I can't do that if it only exists at runtime.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to create a permanently extracted version of the installer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS is built with VC6 (SP5+ProcessorPack+PlatformSDK) and so are all of the official plugins. I'm not sure what you mean by extracted version of the installer. If spawning your installer from Visual Studio is not enough you could probably build NSIS as a debug version (I don't think there is a pre-built debug version, but there is an extended logging version @ http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Special_Builds )</div></div><hr />

I has compiling my plugin as rdkinst.dll and making a copy of it into the Plugins directory called rdkinstD.dll. Since the install was using a differently named DLL, I couldn't debug. Once I named the output file the same namde it worked.</div></div><hr />
