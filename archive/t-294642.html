<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hazmatt</div><div class="date">16th July 2008, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, in my installer, I have install a lot of files and that are too large to be embedded into the installer (over 2 gigs each), so I use CopyFiles...  When that fires up, Windows puts up a Copying Files dialog to show progress. Since I copy from two folders, I execute CopyFiles twice.  Problem is that when   the CopyFiles completes (shows 0mb remaining, it doesn't close),  it stays there and the NSIS installer progresses to the next screen. This means one has to click around the progress window to get to the NSIS installer and click finish.<br />
Its real ugly.  I'm seeing this on Vista.  Obviously /SILENT prevents the dialog, but I need to show progress, we're talking several gigs of data.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

In short, it's a Vista problem that should be fixed with the service pack. Microsoft has this article &quot;The copy process may stop responding... (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/931770)&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hazmatt</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Attempting to install that update, its says, this update does not apply to your system.  This could be because it is for X32, X64 or its already part of SP1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">If you read the KB article from the prior link, it has info for both 64 and 32-bit systems.  <br />
<br />
It also says &quot;This problem was first corrected in Windows Vista Service Pack 1&quot;<br />
<br />
You will also notice it lists some files included with the service pack along with their version numbers. This should allow you to determine if the service pack actually took (aside from just looking at the version number)<br />
<br />
If you are certain you have the service pack, then I'd recommend trying to duplicate the problem within Windows (outside of NSIS) just to see if the problem is with Windows or NSIS.</div></div><hr />
