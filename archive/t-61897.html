<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prodangle</div><div class="date">8th October 2001, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, http://www.firehose.net/free/nsis/ for NSIS 1.52, (most'll already know that by now ).  <br />
<br />
Now for a proposal.  Rather than have loads of threads scattered about for each new NSIS that appears, I suggest just using this thread here.  That way, anyone who wants to be notified by email soon after a new version appears can post a random post here and tick the email notification box below.  When a new version does appear the first person to notice it can post to this thread, and we'll all get notified.  <br />
<br />
There is one problem with this plan you'll probably already have thought of; if anyone posts a random post to get notified, then we'll all get notified of a new post, but I think the good outweighs the bad on this one :)<br />
<br />
Sounds like a good idea to me right now.  If it isn't just ignore me... :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">10th October 2001, 13:21</div></div><div class="posttext">v1.54<br />
<br />
Merged EW_CREATEDIR and EW_SETOUTPATH (since they essentially do the same thing) <br />
<br />
Fixed bug in uninstaller (blank Next button, oops I introduced this in 1.53. Wow, I really suck).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nels</div><div class="date">10th October 2001, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here's another hacked version of NSIS: 1.54f<br />
I added f because I would like to add all the features developed by others in one installer. Can zedzed23 post his sources because I'd like to add the 2 compression types. I also couln't get the lch version :(<br />
<br />
For now here's what's new in version 1.54f:<br />
-Edgewize's ProgressText function<br />
-Edgewize's ReadEnvStr function<br />
-UI now show the &quot;Close&quot; button when aborting<br />
-Some minor fixes (just look at the sources)<br />
<br />
I didn't add Edgewize's /HIDDEN and /UNCHECK flags because I think it's not really useful.<br />

<br />
v1.58<br />

- Added ReadEnvStr (at Eduardo Amatria's suggestion) <br />
- Fixed URL shortcut creation in default installer (thanks to Eduardo Amatria) <br />

It's available on http://www.firehose.net/free/nsis/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 03:53</div></div><div class="posttext">And Now 1.59 !!!!!!!!!!!! Holy Crap!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">17th October 2001, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">And the v1.59 what's new list is:<br />
- Removed GetParent (see GetParent in functions.htm for a replacement =). <br />
- More size optimizations (registry reading, instruction optimization, big exec.c changes, and the removal of GetParent, means even though we've added things like environment reading and better strcpy, we're still 35k). <br />
- Made StrCpy support negative lengths and start_offsets. <br />
- See, what we're going for, is doing more in script, and less as instructions. We'll improve the compiler soon to support things like parameters to functions. Maybe. <br />
- Made Abort command so that you can specify variables as parameters. <br />
- Made RegDll so you can specify variables in symbol name/status text. <br />
- Added output param option to ExecWait (so you can process error codes) <br />
- Fixed some blank output dir &quot;bugs&quot; in Exec and Extract. <br />
<br />
About the parameters: There already is a way to do it.<br />
First, push all vars onto the stack.<br />
Set the parameters in $0-$9 (the ones you need)<br />
Call the function<br />
Get all variables back from the stack.<br />
That could be implemented directly of course.</div></div><hr />

I don't know...  Maybe your way makes far more sense and is far more efficient, but there's something kinda nice about this way (I think at least :D :D :D )<br />

Anyway - I'll shut up too now, I shouldn't be posting here without there being a new NSIS available :p <br />

 Made progress bar use MulDiv() for positioning (more accurate, heh). <br />
 Made install code/stringtab put closer to beginning of installer. (this will help if/when we implement a bz2 mode that needs to mostly access the data sequencially) <br />
 Added GetWinampInstPath function to functions.htm. <br />

Download dev: http://firehose.net/free/nsis/nsis163beta.exe (433kb)<br />
<br />
1.63 beta<br />
 Fixed issue with SetDetailsView <br />
 Added contrib\ <br />
 Moved splash and zip2exe to contrib\ <br />
 Added InstallOptions to contrib\ <br />
 Made it so that when Abort is called from uninstall completed message isn't displayed. <br />
 Made it so than UninstallExeName can contain a fully qualified path (or a non-fully-qualified path) <br />
 Made it so you can override the default file writing error text (FileErrorText) <br />
 Utilized Peter Windridge's resource searching code (for faster makensis startups). <br />
 Utilized Dave Laundon's ideas and (some) code for process_string improvements (which make for smaller installers, yay). Didn't directly integrate though, figured a way which I liked better. <br />
 May have introduced many bugs.<br />
Great stuff.  Yep, I like your way better too :D <br />

That's because the lines are combined before parsing the ;.  I'm not sure this is a bug or just a feature.<br />
