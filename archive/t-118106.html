<br />
Ok. Ive been using NSIS for some time, but I've never tried to delete files specified by a variable...<br />
This is what I do in my uninstaller :<br />
<br />
Delete $2<br />
;where $2 is a filename like C:\crap\myfile.bla<br />
<br />
;I also tried to do :<br />
Delete &quot;$2&quot;<br />
<br />
;and to envelop the filename in &quot;&quot;'s like :<br />
;$2 = &quot;C:\crap\myfile.bla&quot;<br />
<br />
but still the file doesn't get deleted...<br />
The files are not beeing used/open/whatever in any way!!!<br />
They're not hidden/system files...<br />
When I specify files directly, or using &quot;$INSTDIR\myfile.bla&quot; it works just fine...<br />
<br />
Im used NSIS version 1.98 and then downloaded the new version v2.0b0<br />
which does the same thing.<br />
I'm using the old GUI and Windows2000<br />
<br />
Help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />

<br />
I can tell you that the variable contains the right file name, as i made some debug output!<br />
<br />
I'll state the sections that have to do with deleting the file :<br />
<br />
Function un.delete_file<br />
   push $R0<br />
   StrCpy $R0 $2 3 -3 ;get file extension<br />
   StrCmp $R0 &quot;dll&quot; unreg delfile<br />
   StrCmp $R0 &quot;ocx&quot; unreg delfile<br />
unreg:<br />
   UnRegDLL $2<br />
delfile:<br />
   Delete &quot;/REBOOTOK&quot; $2<br />
   pop $R0<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
The variable $2 is read from a logfile i create myself, and I am sure the filename is right!!!<br />
I also tried : <br />
Delete $2<br />
Delete &quot;$2&quot;<br />
and to add &quot; to the filename at the front + back...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean with <br />
StrCpy $2 &quot;C:\foo&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">16th December 2002, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the file reading goes wrong. Use StrCpy and check wheather it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rarefluid</div><div class="date">16th December 2002, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, the problem was that I read the &quot;lines&quot; from a file and the $\r$\n didn't get cut correctly, so the files didn't get deleted... Now it works.<br />
The filenames seemed to be correct, and I didn't notice that the CRLF shouldn't be there.<br />
<br />
Sorry for bothering...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">17th December 2002, 23:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Unrelated, but just spotted a bug in your function (might have just been a typo when you wrote the message):<br />
<br />
   ...<br />
   StrCmp $R0 &quot;dll&quot; unreg delfile<br />
   StrCmp $R0 &quot;ocx&quot; unreg delfile<br />
   ...<br />
<br />
The second StrCmp will never be executed because the first one branches off somewhere else in all cases.<br />
<br />
HTH!<br />
