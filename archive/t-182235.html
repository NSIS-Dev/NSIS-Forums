<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakanor</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to switch from my current setup maker to NSIS, cause it looks like it does a better job for my purpose, except one thing: at the end of the installation I have to present the user up to 3 options (checkboxes). How can I do this? Do I really have to write a custom page for this? I browsed through the documentation and it seems to be quite difficult and I didnt find a way to test the user input of the checkboxes with something like an if-statement.<br />
<br />
Any help would be very appreciated. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

As for the If statements; There was a Logic library supporting that functionality. It was written by dselkirk. You can find this plugin here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=349).</div></div><hr />
