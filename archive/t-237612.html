<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">viachi</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
such problem appeared:<br />
I have to uninstall Cygwin, and install PostgreSQL. I do uninstall step by step as it is described in documentation - stop and remove all services, remove directories and registry,unmount all information related to Cygwin(umount -A, remove the &quot;C:\cygwin\bin&quot; from the systme PATH. <br />
If I don't remove the &quot;C:\cygwin\bin&quot;, usually an error appears  on starting PostgreSQL installer, but I am sure it is not in PATH anymore. <br />
Then I run the PostgreSQL installer and the error still appears. So I think the installer still remember system settings from the moment it has been started, and it knows that &quot;C:\cygwin\bin&quot; is in PATH. <br />
I tried to split the installer in two parts, one for Cygwin uninstalling and one that starts after that with PostgreSQL installation, but it is the same.<br />
So, is there way to refresh installer, or restart it again(without rstarting windows), or some other way?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

If you type: echo %PATH% from a DOS prompt you'll notice that Windows still has &quot;c:\cygwin\bin&quot; in it's path.  So, you'll need to set the path again using set with all the other paths except the one you don't want.  Type: set /? from a prompt to see the options.  I've never had to do this so I'm just assuming.  I removed a path from my path using the GUI and it didn't reset the PATH variable either until I restarted but SET will also do that.</div></div><hr />

I checked PATH, after removing directory from My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt;Advanced -&gt; Environment Variables, with &quot;echo %PATH%&quot; and &quot;SET&quot; commands. In both cases my directory was missing. But when I tried to change PATH with SET command, no, changes appears. <br />
Thanks anyway, i will read about this more, when I have little time, guess,I can find a solution :).</div></div><hr />
