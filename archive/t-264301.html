<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pawel</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
I would like to do an installer with custom page. On that custom page there will be some very important text - user must read this text, so I want to . <br />
For example:<br />
...<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES  ; installing files<br />
  Page custom CreateMe CheckMe &quot;&quot;  ; creating custom page<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH     ; finishing installer<br />
...<br />
Function CreateMe<br />
 InstallOptions::initDialog /NOUNLOAD &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\test.ini&quot;<br />
 !insertmacro MUI_HEADER_TEXT &quot;Some text&quot; &quot;Some other text&quot;<br />
 InstallOptions::show<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
Function CheckMe<br />
;???<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
How to do that Custom Page will be shown, after installing files with &quot;Next&quot; button dissabled (on this custom page). After 15 seconds all buttons (back, next) must be enabled - user can click this button and finish installer<br />
<br />
Is it also possible to  show, on disabled &quot;Next&quot; button, counting down from 15 to 0 - that user could see progress to enable buttons.<br />
<br />
If anybody knows how to do this, please help me. Thanks<br />
Regards!</div></div><hr />

Perhaps someone else could think/show another more accurate way.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, it is not what I am looking for...<br />
Or I don't understand what that example do...<br />
My custom page must be shown with some text, with disabled button &quot;Next&quot; - after 15 seconds this button must change its state to enabled.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that. Nothing is working...<br />

At least as far as I can get.</div></div><hr />
