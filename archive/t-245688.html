<br />
* but now I want to sign the un-installer also. <br />
<br />
I know I can install on a test PC the get the uninst.exe ofcourse, but how do I get this into the installer again? hmmm... cannot sign the STUB since it is not final when compiling NSIS script.<br />
<br />
MY IDEA:<br />
I would like to have an option just before the uninstaller exe is &quot;glued&quot; to the intaller to sign this executable. Is there a mistery option? e.g. the un-install is writen as temp file on build machine so I can just before it is &quot;glued&quot; sign the application</div></div><hr />

When the installer writes the uninstaller, it doesn't just extract a precompiled executable. It copies itself, patches the icons and appends the data.<br />
<br />
What you can do is to create the uninstaller on the build machine, sign it, and use File to extract it instead of WriteUninstaller. It can all be done in a batch file called using !system.</div></div><hr />

I realize I will just puzzle along again on my quest for the ultimate build system.<br />
<br />
BTW <br />
I succesfully signed an Win32 installer on FreeBSD with opensource http://sourceforge.net/projects/osslsigncode<br />
<br />
For this you need ofcourse an Authenticode sign key and cert you buy e.g. at http://www.thawte.com/</div></div><hr />

Any 'tricks' to getting the uninstaller to uninstall itself? Or should one just use the /REBOOTOK when removing...</div></div><hr />

Close, but not quite what I was wanting. I'm thinking that if I write my own uninstaller completely, (so I can sign it) then it must be able to delete itself. In that case, the main installer won't have an uninstall section. <br />
<br />
I guess the traditional delete on reboot is the way to go in that case...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mauvecloud</div><div class="date">26th March 2008, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I do for signing an uninstaller:<br />
1. Have an &quot;uninstall maker&quot; script that doesn't install any files; it silently performs the WriteUninstaller step to put an uninstaller in the application directory. It includes the uninstall section and whatever &quot;un.&quot; functions you need.<br />
2. Run the &quot;uninstall maker&quot;.<br />
3. Sign the resulting uninstaller.<br />
4. Use the &quot;File&quot; command to extract the uninstaller during installation.</div></div><hr />

&gt; 2. Run the &quot;uninstall maker&quot;.<br />
<br />
Exactly this part is my problem, this strategy will not work if you make your Win32 builds on a Linux/Solaris build Machine. <br />
<br />
Thanks anyhow for the idea, might help someone else whou build on a Windows OS not Linux(Or Apple OSX for that matter ;).</div></div><hr />
