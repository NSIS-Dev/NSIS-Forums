<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">f1nn</div><div class="date">17th October 2007, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I am having a install problem with the $INSTDIR. the first time the application installs it installs to C:\progrm files\application, durring the install files are installed to a bin folder. This works well. The problem is if I would try to install it a second time say if a file has been added the destion folder will now show as C:program files\application\bin this causes a second bin folder to be created and the installation to go to there. My script sets setoverwrite to on. but i am not sure why on the first install the destination folder is C:\program files\application and on a second install it is C:\program files\application\bin should it not be the same destination folder as the first time. the script does set SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\Bin&quot; in the main section. I think this may have something to do with it but if so why is the first time installation only setting the path to C:\program files\application. many thanks for any help anyone can give me :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backland</div><div class="date">17th October 2007, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing you are using InstallDirRegKey in your installer. This causes the installer to remember the Bin directory on the second install.<br />
<br />
For more details, look it up in the docs.<br />
<br />
PS: Please try to use paragraphs :eek:</div></div><hr />
