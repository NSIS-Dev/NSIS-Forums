<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cvx_borg</div><div class="date">16th May 2003, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">hello, i have the following question: is there a possibility (in 2.0b0) to be able to _set_ the installation type? i need a restartable installation tool that (during the 2nd run) skips the initial screens, starts right at the installation options, having set the insttype to the saved one. (saving it is no problem, but setting it back is.. :)) does anyone have an idea? (apart from saving the &quot;enabledness&quot; of all sections on the 1st run and setting it back on the 2nd and so on.) it would be great :)</div></div><hr />

That shall help you a lot.<br />
<br />
If you aren't using MUI, then set pre functions like so:<br />
Page Directory DirectoryFunc<br />
Function DirectoryFunc<br />
  StrCmp $0 1 dontSkip # if $0 = 1 don't skip page<br />
    Abort # skip the page<br />
  dontSkip:<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
-Stu</div></div><hr />

 thanks, i did not mention that i already solved the skipping pages part of the problem :) i only have problems with setting the insttype. since i abort the components page the insttype gets reset to the 1st one, even if the user chose the 2nd in the last session.. :(</div></div><hr />

 :( btw, can i tweak the mui somehow so that the (to-be-aborted-anyway) components page would start up with insttype #2 by default? i guess it would solve my problem as well, although it's not too nice but would do the work :) else i guess i really should resort to save all flags-restore all flags in the very first hidden section.. :/<br />
<br />
Care you supply an example script?  i would, but can't :( sorry, it's about 1000-1500 lines long, with a modification in the mui core, so i guess it would be a bit too tiring :) besides, parts of it are company confidental in this phase :(, and most of all, as far as i understand, i need a yet-non-existent code to be inserted somewhere, so the current code would not help too much, would it :)</div></div><hr />
