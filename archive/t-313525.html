<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OrganicBytes</div><div class="date">8th October 2009, 05:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting this error message when I reinstall my app in Windows Vista.  It appears after I close the installer once it's finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;This program might not have installed correctly.&quot;<br />
<br />
This only appears when I reinstall while it's already installed.  It doesn't happen on the first install and if I uninstall and reinstall I don't get this message.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to figure out why this message is appearing?  Vista doesn't give any information other than that message.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">8th October 2009, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We are getting the same error in our installer, but only on a reinstall, and yes, we have Admin as the required level. We do write to the registry for the ARP, but I guess because it is a reinstall, it is writing out the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
Do we need to do registry shenanigans to solve this? Write some random string just so Windows doesn't stroke out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">8th October 2009, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">hm, maybe add/update the &quot;InstallDate&quot; would work, at least if windows is hashing the data the hash should change<br />
<br />
and if not, maybe ask over @ http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/</div></div><hr />

My &quot;problem&quot; was something like this: I had string &quot;install&quot; mentioned in the file properties Description field (it was actually a part of a bigger word: &quot;installation&quot;), Win7 found it *after* running the exe. The exe wasn't an (un)installer, so Win7 thought something was wrong. I removed the word and error didn't appear anymore.  Was pretty hard to figure out..</div></div><hr />
