For example, C:\PROGRA~1\TASKTR~1. Full filenames are only appearing after browsing for a folder. Script attached.</div></div><hr />

Ah, so that's why I couldn't download it. I thought it was an error or something :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">michaelmross</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's try that again. But anyway, the issue is not present on another system, so maybe it's not NSIS-specific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you made sure this short name doesn't come from the installation directory registry key (HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\TaskTracker.exe)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">michaelmross</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe that was it. I can't say positively because the problem has gone away for now on the original system. I browsed to the directory, and this problably reset the key. It's correct now. If it recurs, I will check it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that on XP you can turn off the 8.3 filename support within the OS. It speeds up disk access considerably (almost 35%) since the OS doesn't have to create 8.3 filenames for each of the files it is writing to disk. Perhaps, on the system you are using the creation of 8.3 headers was disabled.</div></div><hr />
