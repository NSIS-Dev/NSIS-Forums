<br />
I have to install COMDLG32.OCX on my target system, and I need to make sure it is at least the version I have (6.0 something).<br />
How do I only install it when it's a newer version?<br />
At the moment I only install when the file doesn't exist yet. Using IFNEWER doesn't work, because NSIS takes the file *creation* time instead of the file *modification* time! That's not right, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RookieKiwi</div><div class="date">2nd April 2001, 07:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The IfNewer option is a great addition, but some sort of version checking is still really needed. I know users get mighty mad if you stuff their system up with an old DLL or OCX.<br />
<br />
At least the new version of NSIS allows you to copy the existing files into a backup folder first, just to be safe.<br />
<br />
I notice there was a patch sent in around version 1.1j that had OCX and DLL version checking, anyway to integrate this back in to the new versions?<br />
<br />
I'm cursed with only being able to code in VB, otherwise I would do it myself. :-)<br />
<br />
Anybody want to write a C++ exe that can be called from the installer and passed parameters?<br />
<br />
Something like:<br />
<br />
Delete &quot;$TEMP\Newer.txt&quot;<br />
ExecWait CompVer &quot;$SYSDIR\mfc42.dll&quot; &quot;$TEMP\mfc42.dll&quot; &quot;$TEMP\Newer.txt&quot;<br />
IfFileExists &quot;$TEMP\Newer.txt&quot; Jump or Extract file</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Have a look at this... It can retrieve file version info and it's VB. I haven't got time right now to write a version compare app, but this might work... As long as you're distributing the VB Runtimes with your project, that is.</div></div><hr />
