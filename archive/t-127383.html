<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a custome dialog page that has a bitmap in it.  I want the bitmap aligned to the left edge of the dialog so there is no empty space between the bitmap and the left edge of the dialog.  In my ini file for the dialog I have the following entry for displaying the bitmap,<br />
<br />
[Field 5]<br />
Type=bitmap<br />
Text=MyImage.bmp<br />
Left=0<br />
Right=16<br />
Top=0<br />
Bottom=314<br />
<br />
I figured Left=0 would but the image right on the edge of the dialog but there is clearly space in between the bitmap and the edge of the dialog.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  Although if I change the dimensions it resizes the image to fit the dimensions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is usually a margin between the inner window and the edge of the dialog.<br />
<br />
You can add an extra rect to the UI dialog resource and use the IO Rect setting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes sense then.<br />
<br />
You can add an extra rect to the UI dialog resource and use the IO Rect setting. <br />
<br />
I don't know what you mean by adding an extra rect though.  Do you mean I need to modify the dialog resource exectuable?</div></div><hr />

You should modify the UI (Contrib\UIs\default.exe) and use ChangeUI.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that's exactly what I want to do.  I'll definitely try that out. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I could be looking at this wrong but ChangeUI doesn't seem to let you change the appearance of the finish page.</div></div><hr />

Sure I understand that.  However, I'm looking at the resource exe's that are currently there (default, modern, modern1) and I don't see any visual relation between the dialog's in those files and the ones that are used in my installer.  I'm sure they are related I just find it difficult seeing any relation at all.  Is there an easy way to tell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The black rect in the middle of dialog 105 is the one NSIS puts the dialog on. You need to create another one just like it, resize it to fill the width of the installer and tell InstallOptions to use it with the Rect field in the Settings section of the INI file.<br />
<br />
Because NSIS puts the other dialogs &quot;inside&quot; that rect you will never see a &quot;complete&quot; dialog in the resource editor only parts of it. Other than that some controls are hidden by default and are unhidden by NSIS at runtime, that might create a difference too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">That was the key.  Once I set &quot;Rect&quot; equal to 1044 I got what I was looking for.  Thanks alot for your help guys!</div></div><hr />
