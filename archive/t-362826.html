<br />
My installer requests for admin privileges using &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot;.<br />
When the installer is run by a non-admin, the UAC dialog requests for admin credentials.<br />
After that is provided, the installer dialog is no longer visible properly (it is just a white window) though it runs. <br />
<br />
I saw some discussions that when the UAC plugin is used, the installer runs in the background. But I do not use the UAC plugin.<br />
<br />
What is the reason for this behavior? And how can I resolve it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Srividya</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you provide some more information? Windows version, NSIS version etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the quick response.<br />
<br />
It is not visible at all. (Before and after requesting credentials).<br />
(No longer was with reference to the scenario where it is run by an admin where it is visible and everything works fine).<br />
<br />
Windows version: Win7 and also windows server 2008.<br />
NSIS version: 2.46<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need any further information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">3rd June 2013, 08:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it also happen with a really basic script?<br />
<br />
<br />
RequestExecutionLevel admin<br />
outfile test.exe<br />
page instfiles<br />
section<br />
sectionend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srividyatr</div><div class="date">3rd June 2013, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, the same behaviour/problem is observed with the basic script that you have mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">3rd June 2013, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never seen this problem before. Have you tried reinstalling NSIS?<br />
<br />
Also just a note if you aren't already you need to check the user is actually an administrator using UserInfo::GetAccountType.<br />
<br />
Stu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srividyatr</div><div class="date">4th June 2013, 05:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Realized that the problem is happening only when running the installer remotely on a win7 machine (connected using mstsc). If I am locally logged in a win7 machine, then it works fine. <br />
Is there some way I can address this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">4th June 2013, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe NSIS cares if you are using RDP. It only uses standard controls and basic GDI stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srividyatr</div><div class="date">4th June 2013, 07:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem happens not just with an installer created using NSIS but even with installers created using other means. But if there is a way it can be addressed, then it would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">5th June 2013, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">If it happens to non-NSIS application it is probably a Windows issue, drivers maybe?</div></div><hr />
