I would think you would have to compile the NSIS MakeNSISW for linux, right? Then you could use it via command line. The reason I'm compileing on a linux box is simple due to what we run on our server. The installer would, have a CD key that would have to be inputed to get to the rest of the install process. For this to work, I'm going to have to compile a version of the installer each time with it's own key. Any help would rock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I should be able to run the command `makensis` on the shell and have it make the installer. Where would I get the binary for the linux version from?<br />
<br />
Also, any guidance you could give on a CD Key style authication would be very good.</div></div><hr />

For others, you'll have to build it yourself according to instructions in INSTALL and the documentation (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixG.html).</div></div><hr />
