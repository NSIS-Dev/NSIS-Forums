<br />
Using setups created using UltraModernUI I noticed the plugin directory was not removed at the end of the installation.<br />
UltraModernUI only copies bmp files used to customize the look of the setup, no dll is used at runtime.<br />
When I exit the setup, bmp files are removed, therefore the directory is empty, but is not removed.<br />
To me it looks like NSIS couldn't delete the folder because windows, at the time it wanted to delete the folder, hadn't finish deleting the bmp. But i can be wrong.<br />
<br />
Is there any known issue with UltraModerUI (it works (= it fails  to remove the directory)) with the basic.nsi example of this &quot;plugin&quot;) ?<br />
Is there any known syncronisation issue with the deletion of ressources in $PLUGINSDIR ?<br />
<br />
I tried with an empty script initializing the pluginsdir without using it, it is deleted as expected.</div></div><hr />

That will prevent the directory from being removed. You should do a SetOutPath to any other location before exiting the installer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I customized UltraModernUI so as to be able to define my custom .onGuiEnd function (since the plugin catches it already) and in my callback i change SetOutPath to $INSTDIR before leaving.<br />
<br />
The only SetOutPat $PLUGINSDIR i do is followed by a SetOutPat $INSTDIR, therefore the problem seemed to come from UltraModernUI (as i mentioned earlier it can be reproduced using UMI samples).</div></div><hr />
