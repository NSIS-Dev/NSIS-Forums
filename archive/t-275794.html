<br />
I was wondering if there was anyway to implement a language selection dropdown into the installer welcome page (or some other IO page)?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">12th August 2007, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome page or some other IO page means the gui is already running.<br />
Language should be set in function .onInit or at least in function .onGuiInit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bl4d3</div><div class="date">12th August 2007, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">i know this is not what you wanted, but why you want a language selection on welcome page instead of this:<br />
<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Arabic&quot;<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Polish&quot;<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;German&quot;<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot;<br />
...<br />
!insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_LANGDLL<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
//this one ask the user for his prefered language before the installer starts his job<br />
<br />
<br />
i think something like this doesn't make so much sense, because from what reason the user should change from one language to another? the user will always choose his motherlanguage during the short time he spent to install your program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backland</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 05:26</div></div><div class="posttext">What is requested is to not ask the user for a language and automatically choose the OS language if available in the installer, otherwise default to english.<br />
<br />
However, they also would like to have a small dropdown or button to change the language on the first page of the installer, the Welcome page in this case.<br />
<br />
As for changing the language after onInit, i think its not really a problem to change the lang on the first page as we can just restart the installer with the new lang</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 06:00</div></div><div class="posttext">So what is your query, if you can add a dropdown on welcome page?<br />
It is documented that you can edit the iospecial.ini.<br />
Changing the welcome/finish page by adding another control should be the easy part of the job, however, I can't seem to figure how the language change would work at that stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backland</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, thats my query: How to restart installer with a new language.<br />
<br />
I think its possible to store the new language in the reg and read it after restarting in onInit, looking into it...</div></div><hr />
