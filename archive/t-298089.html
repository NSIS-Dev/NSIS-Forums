<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kukomamasan</div><div class="date">4th October 2008, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, if you know the location where regasm.exe should be installed (my location is C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322), make an<br />
<br />
ifexist &quot;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\regasm.exe&quot; good<br />
file &quot;ur location of the regasm.exe&quot;<br />
good:<br />
---<br />
<br />
also make sure you $INSTDIR is C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322 , or what ever ur version is.<br />
Well not an expert here by a longshot, but maybe it will make you get ahead by trial and error :-), since no on else did answer yet?(but im sure some expert will now, since my explanation is not the best i guess hehe)<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">4th October 2008, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">a more appropriate method of checking should be to read the registry value of<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v1.1.4322::SP<br />
<br />
The value of SP dictates the service pack installed.<br />
absent = err<br />
0 = no service pack<br />
1 = service pack 1<br />
2 = service pack 2 (or would have been if there was one; MS is at .NET 3.5 SP1 by now)<br />
<br />
For the curious, check the following code sample from Aaron Stebner (*tips hat*) for detecting the various .NET framework versions and service packs:<br />
http://astebner.sts.winisp.net/Tools/detectFX.cpp.txt<br />
<br />
Some of this detection may already be in an NSIS header, for that matter... didn't spot one, though (saw some disjointed examples for framework 2 / detecting 'framework in general')</div></div><hr />
