<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wacaveman</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also doing a two-in-one install.  I have everything worked out (I think), except for the uninstaller.  I have an uninstaller for each package, which does everything, with the exeption of being able to delete the shortcuts correctly.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to pass information to the Uninstall section using variables?  Globals don't seem to stick very well.  It does seem a bit odd, as $INSTDIR works fine, but everything I define does not.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

The built in variables are automatically detected at runtime.<br />
<br />
If you need some install data in the uninstaller, you can save that data to the registry or a file at install time, see the ReadRegStr and ReadINIStr functions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darthvader</div><div class="date">15th August 2007, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The $INSTDIR populated is the default value you have given by using this command <br />
<br />
InstallDir &quot;XXXXXXXX&quot;<br />
<br />
Hence when the user changes the Installation Directory your uninstallation will fail. So the best bet is to make a registry entry and then read it back during uninstallation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backland</div><div class="date">15th August 2007, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if the user changes the install dir at runtime, that will break your uninstaller (unless you disable the user from selecting a dir).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wacaveman</div><div class="date">15th August 2007, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">No, since the installer is two-in-one (actually about seven-in-one), the directories are fixed,and the user doesn't have the luxury of changing directories.  Since I overwrite $INSTDIR (rather than using InstallDir), it seems to work fine.  Much better than the alternative of having installers three levels deep.</div></div><hr />
