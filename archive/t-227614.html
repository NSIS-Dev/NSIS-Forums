<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jamyn</div><div class="date">4th October 2005, 07:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen a few plugins that do banner-style or popup progress bars.  Is there anything that mimics the install progress bar for Sections?  By this I mean, the progress bar for install sections is built into the page itself.<br />
<br />
I would like to call a pre-install page that has a progress bar; it's not actually installing anything, but instead checking for/downloading updates.  Since this section is not inside the Section area, I can't utilize the standard progress bar.<br />
<br />
MSIBanner seems to be a pop-up. :\  Same thing for the one built into InetLoad (It looks like you can have InetLoad's banner built into a display page, but that page must be inside the &quot;install files&quot; section).<br />
<br />
I'll keep digging around, but hopefully someone's seen something I've missed :)</div></div><hr />
