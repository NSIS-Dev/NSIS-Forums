<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brandNewUser</div><div class="date">4th November 2005, 02:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm very new to the NSIS way of doing things, but I've got an install script now (written in another installer product) that uses a lot of external Cygwin calls to launch rsync.exe, which then copies updated files around depending on various conditions.<br />
<br />
One of the things I do with this script is pop open the bash.exe window I launch rsync from, and configure rsync to output verbose information to that screen.  That way, users can see exactly which files are being transferred, and how long each file should take.<br />
<br />
Using my current product is a little clunky.  I'd love to be able to stay within the native installer dialogs, but there's no way I know of to constantly update text on a dialog short of some really ugly hacks.<br />
<br />
Basically, I want to show the user a dialog that contains a running tail on a file.  I remember the old WinAmp install used to do something analogous, which is what made me think of NSIS.<br />
<br />
Can NSIS do anything like this?</div></div><hr />

Banner with Cancel button, MSIBanner. Two banners for direct draw on the dialog window - Marquee and Embedded Banner.<br />
From the other hand you can create a whole custom page, please read NSIS manual or use forum search for a code samples.</div></div><hr />
