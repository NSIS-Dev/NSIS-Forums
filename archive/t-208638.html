<br />
I'm developing a NSIS script that includes the installation of the drivers for several non-PnP PCI devices.<br />
 <br />
I've tried many things with no result. The latest I've found is a script by Kuba Ober that you can find in NSIS Archive as &quot;Driver installation and update&quot;  When I run it, my driver is not installed because in the results window appears the following message:<br />
 <br />
&quot;The device is not plugged in, cannot update the driver&quot;<br />
 <br />
I don't know if this script has been specifically designed for USB devices.<br />
 <br />
I wonder If some of you have had any experience with this script and would like to suggest any solution or comment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your time!<br />
<br />
Marcos.</div></div><hr />
