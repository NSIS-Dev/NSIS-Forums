<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeisan</div><div class="date">2nd June 2006, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, i need a little help, im doing an install for a oracle runtime, it mess with registries and reg diles and another setups extracted to a temp file.<br />
<br />
in that there is no problem i did everything reading the forums but now in the UAT. <br />
<br />
i found the next problem.<br />
<br />
When i install the first time it creates the folders as i told it. ie.<br />
<br />
C:\oracle\forms<br />
This is mis $INSTdir <br />
<br />
and inside it it have several folders like BIN<br />
C:\oracle\forms\bin<br />
<br />
but after it finish i decide to reinstall it without uninstall it to see what it doest and i realize that the installations was not skipping or overwriting so i decide to dig a little and i found the next.<br />
<br />
in the 2nd. install i found inside the BIN folder a identical structure as it was the instdir <br />
so in exemple<br />
<br />
inside C:\oracle\forms\bin<br />
i found another bin<br />
C:\oracle\forms\bin\bin<br />
and in here i find all the files of the installation.<br />
<br />
i checked and i dont find where to look to fix this error.<br />
could it be when in compiled ? or a bad directory that i wrote.<br />
<br />
here are some parts of my code.<br />
<br />
OutFile &quot;Setup.exe&quot;<br />
InstallDir &quot;c:\oracle\forms&quot;<br />
InstallDirRegKey HKLM &quot;${PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY}&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
ShowInstDetails show<br />
ShowUnInstDetails show<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Runtime&quot; SEC02<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\BIN&quot;<br />
  SetOverwrite try<br />
  File &quot;C:\oracle\Forms\BIN\CA60.DLL&quot;<br />
  File &quot;C:\oracle\Forms\BIN\CORE40.DLL&quot;<br />
  File &quot;C:\oracle\Forms\BIN\D2SC60.DLL&quot;<br />
  File &quot;C:\oracle\Forms\BIN\D2SCV60.EXE&quot;<br />
  File &quot;C:\oracle\Forms\BIN\DE60.DLL&quot;<br />
  File &quot;C:\oracle\Forms\BIN\DEB60.DLL&quot;<br />
  ....<br />
<br />
<br />
if someone could help me with some tip to fix this it would be really appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
ps. i attached a composed image of 2 explorer windows so you can see what im talking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd June 2006, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this might be the problem.<br />
You are using:<br />
InstallDirRegKey HKLM &quot;${PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY}&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
However, when you write to it after installation (in Section -Post), your code is:<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;${PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY}&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\BIN\D2SCV60.EXE&quot;<br />
<br />
Should be:<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;${PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY}&quot; &quot;&quot; $INSTDIR<br />
<br />
Just a question... was it not possible to use File /r instead of including each and every file individualy?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd June 2006, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to compress a folder, use:<br />
SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
File /r &quot;local_folder\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
This will extract all files in local_folder to $INSTDIR.<br />
<br />
Similarly:<br />
SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
File /r &quot;local_folder&quot;<br />
<br />
This will extract local_folder and its contents to $INSTDIR.<br />
