<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">midix</div><div class="date">3rd July 2007, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I live in Latvia and we here often have computers where the Windows setting &quot;Language for non-Unicode programs&quot; may be Latvian or Russian (depends on the user). That is why I usually make my software with Unicode support to be sure it will work correctly. <br />
So I made a setup package with NSIS and selected Latvian language. Everything is fine on a Latvian PC but on a PC with Russian codepage I see many unrecognizable simbols in my setup package (because I did not include English language :D  ). <br />
<br />
It is a pity that such a complicated and great install system does not have Unicode support! :( <br />
<br />
If developers do not plan to add Unicode support for some time then maybe someone could suggest other freeware installer which supports custom dialog translations and Unicode?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
P.S. Hmmm... maybe I should get the source and try to &quot;Unicodize&quot; it? If only it will not be really hard task....</div></div><hr />

Please look for the Unicode thread in the NSIS discussion.  It explains how to download and test this version of NSIS.</div></div><hr />
