<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taake</div><div class="date">27th September 2006, 02:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys.<br />
<br />
I have finished coding my installer using NSIS, but there are a few little features that I'd like to sort out to make it more 'user-friendly'.<br />
The main one that I'm having trouble with is being able to prompt the user to locate a file (this will be inside a certain section).  Basically, the user has selected a certain install configuration at the components page which enables them to use their own file in the installation progress, and I want to be able to prompt them for that file's location to be able to use it.<br />
Right now I've basically told the user, with a messagebox, to place the file (named exactly a certain name) on the Desktop so I can pick it up. Of course, as you can imagine, this isn't very friendly and could be a lot better using a prompt.<br />
<br />
I've searched extensively (well, at least, I'd like to think so) and haven't found anything on the matter, so I was wondering if anybody around here has some method to do this.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taake</div><div class="date">27th September 2006, 23:21</div></div><div class="posttext">PageEx wouldn't work, as this can only happen inside a section (unless I use SectionGetFlags I guess).  The plug-in will, though.<br />
<br />
Considering that I couldn't get any good results by typing 'nsis dialogs' into Google just then, it must've been pretty well hidden :/<br />
<br />
Looks like you made this one yourself.<br />
Thanks for it.</div></div><hr />

Did you try the same search query on wiki (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Category:Plugins)</div></div><hr />

Not initially, no.  I searched the wiki, but didn't look in the Plugins category.<br />
Thanks again, I implemented it yesterday and it works very well.</div></div><hr />
