A small C plug-in (6KB) which extends the functionality of NSIS to support C-style expressions. They can be used in an ${If} like so:${If} ${Expr} `(R0 == 9 || r0 == 3) &amp;&amp; (R0 == 0 || !r2)`<br />
  ...Or they can be evaluated with their result written to a variable:${ExprEval} `(r3 + 20) / 3 * -2` $R0http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsExpr_plug-in<br />
<br />
See Readme.txt in the zip file for available operators. May need some further testing.<br />

Please write a little more about usage on the wiki!<br />
<br />
My personal opinion:<br />
Using  R0-R9 (for $R0-$R9) and r0-r9 (for $0-$9) is not too user friendly as NSIS script is case INsensitive which may lead to some hard-to-find errors during debugging the script.</div></div><hr />

OK will do.<br />
My personal opinion:<br />
Using  R0-R9 (for $R0-$R9) and r0-r9 (for $0-$9) is not too user friendly as NSIS script is case INsensitive which may lead to some hard-to-find errors during debugging the script.<br />
You do not have to use R0 or r0 if you don't want to (you can just superimpose $R0 and $0 into the string). The benefits of using R0/r0 though is outlined in the readme. The reason I have chose R0 and r0 is because this is what the System plug-in uses. It wouldn't be wise to invent another variable naming system. Even so, what would you suggest? You can't just put 0 for $0 can you...<br />
