<br />
This code should contain the following instruction:<br />
<br />
WriteINIStr $TEMP\something.ini section1 something 123<br />
<br />
Accordingly after the first run of the app was written in the section1 of the file something.ini the key something with its value 123.<br />
<br />
But does this also mean, that at every new run of the app the key something with its value 123 was written again in the section1 of the file something.ini, though this key and its appropriate value already exist after the first run of the app?</div></div><hr />
