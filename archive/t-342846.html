<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaMsTeYr</div><div class="date">3rd March 2012, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that this question MAY have been answered before, but the last correspondence was in 2002 and I'm wondering if things may have changed since then.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is essentially this:<br />
<br />
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/508717/Untitled-1.jpg<br />
<br />
Something did I did before, using a custom page, that dynamically writes the checkboxes on the page via the files of that extension in a certain folder. The limitation of this however, is that I can only have 20 on screen at one time, and that is certainly an issue for me.<br />
<br />
What I'm asking is this: Is there anyway I can display a near infinite number of this in a single NSIS page, through scrolling or any other methods? I'm trying to figure this out but nothing comes to mind.<br />
<br />
Help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could use a ListView with checkboxes but that is a little bit of work, there should be a listview nsh around somewhere, try searching for it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
NSD_CreateListBox?<br />
<br />
anyway, i wanted to point out this installer demands quite a lot from the user. if you can't avoid this, at least consider adding select/deselect all buttons.<br />
<br />
also i was wondering why you didn't use the components page for the selection, would've been the easiest way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaMsTeYr</div><div class="date">4th March 2012, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, I'm not using NSIS as an installer in this case, and in above mentioned case. They're not meant to install things per se.<br />
<br />
For example, the application above, was made so that it was easier for me to extract the contents of .u files for Unreal Tournament, where it would do so for only the selected .u files. To do so manually would be using the command line prompt for it all.<br />
<br />
I was planning to see if I could make an app installer for Android, where if I pointed to the location of all my APK files, it would automatically select them all, and I could untick the ones I don't want.<br />
<br />
It's simpler to say I am using NSIS for more than what it was intended for.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll have a look at that, thanks.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Not really what I'm looking at with ListBoxes, not what I wanted from the interface at least.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to make something like this in NSIS:<br />

Taken from the MSDN, Check Box Lists.<br />
<br />
EDIT-2: Case should be closed, no idea why this didn't come up earlier, something written by Afrow-UK before.<br />

<br />
Looks like exactly what I need :)</div></div><hr />
