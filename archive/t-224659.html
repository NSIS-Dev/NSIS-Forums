<br />
Is there a trick that is needed to get Merge Modules (.msm files) to install correctly?<br />
<br />
I've created an install which needs to install the microsoft SAPI 5 speech support.  MS's speech support is given in the form of .msm files.  When I try to install the .msm files directly, they don't seem to successfully enable the speech support.<br />
<br />
I created a blank .msi install (that only installs the .msm files) and it gives me the correct support, so I know which files I need and that it *can* work.  I've visited other posts which have told me how to install .msm files by themselves (basically they say to use 'msiexec /i &quot;&lt;filename&gt;.msm&quot;') and this *seems* to work in that it says that it is 'installing...'.<br />
<br />
I've tried installing them manually and it doesn't work.  Short of the MSI, I've not been able to get the speech to work, and I presume that's because the merge modules haven't been installed correctly.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong?  Has anyone else had any similar problems getting .msm files to install correctly?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Luke</div></div><hr />
