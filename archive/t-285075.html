<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SoKoOLz</div><div class="date">16th January 2008, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I've searched the WIKI and the forum already.<br />
The only thing that I found was the Unicode version of NSIS, I've tried it and still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
So I think I should start some post.<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm currently working on the uTorrent (http://www.utorrent.com) installer [not official]. Which will contains All of its plugins, WebUI, Language, icons, etc.<br />
<br />
I've managed to make it works for sometimes now, however up until now I figured that the Uninstall entries and the shortcut entries are not exactly the same as the program itself. Since the name &quot;uTorrent&quot; , the 'u' character in this place stands for micro(Âµ) &lt;&lt; the Special character representing the power of 9 in Mathematics, not the normal 'u' we've already known about. <br />
<br />
So all I want is to change all of my entries to this 'Âµ' instead. However, it doesn't seems to work at all. I tried to converting my script to the Unicode format so that I can put this 'Âµ' in my script. But the shortcut and the uninstall entries display wrong character. <br />
<br />
Below are my Screenies:<br />

<br />
<br />
I have no idea what to do now. Any suggestions anyone?<br />
May be the only way to do this is to use the RAW ASCII code or something..<br />
<br />
Thank you guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SoKoOLz</div><div class="date">16th January 2008, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">T_T, well that's too bad then..I've just found the Âµ ASCII code. But don't know how to use it in NSIS. <br />
<br />
The ASCII code for &quot;Âµ&quot; is 'ALT+0181' (without +).<br />

<br />
I guess I might have to leave it like this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">16th January 2008, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a Unicode registry key, Unicode Windows API calls should be used to write it. Assuming that the unofficial Unicode NSIS version uses these Unicode registry functions, I think you should check whether the encoding of your script file is correct.<br />
<br />
By the way, the mu symbol also exists in all the standard Windows ANSI codepages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SoKoOLz</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I see.., I think it's my system then. hmm.<br />
My system could not save 'Âµ' character in ANSI encoding script, I have to convert it to UTF. T_T<br />
<br />
So I think there's no way to make this installer on my system.. so sad..<br />
<br />
But, thanks anyway for the replies.<br />
Cheers ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't give up, Somewhere along the line you made a small mistake. IMHO The best is to start with a real minimal NSIS script from *scratch* which does nothing more than to write and entry in the registry like:<br />
<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\mytestentry&quot; &quot;DisplayName&quot; &quot;ÂµMyTest&quot;<br />
<br />
So NO old code just make a small NEW script...<br />
<br />
etc.etc.<br />
<br />
It can be done, see attatchment where for fun I changed 7-Zip uninstall entry.<br />
<br />
TIP: read this about Unicode for a good understanding.<br />
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html<br />
<br />
Good luck, and thank you for choosing NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SoKoOLz</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, now I can see that it is very normal character to the system. However, with normal script encoding (ANSI) in my system. I couldn't get it out, it displays 'à¸•' instead of 'Âµ'.<br />
<br />
What editor are you using? I'm using Notepad ++?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The standard Notepad should work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also use a solution similar to the following with the ANSI version.<br />

Was there a specific problem?  Are you using some plugins that are not part of the regular NSIS install?</div></div><hr />
