<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgt-d</div><div class="date">18th April 2003, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I made an installer based on yesterday's cvs snapshot...  it runs fine from any folder on my computer.  But, if I burn it to a CD it won't run right.  It creates the $INSTDIR and then sets $OUTPATH to that folder, then it just freezes.  You have to ctrl+alt+del to kill the installer.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else seeing this problem?</div></div><hr />

Make sure the CD has no scratches and that the data on it isn't damaged (copy it back to HD and diff). If it's a big installer that uses bzip2 you should also give it some time until it extracts big files from the installer.</div></div><hr />
