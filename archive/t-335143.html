<br />
I am writing an installer and using the nxs banner (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nxs_plug-in) plug-in to display progress while running some additional tasks during the installation process. The problem is that if the user clicks on to another application while the banner is displayed and then clicks back to the installer the banner window goes behind the main installer window which looks confusing.<br />
<br />
For the moment I have used the /h switch to put a button for the banner window in the taskbar but I would like to be able to force the banner to stay at the front. My idea was to use SendMessage to call BringToFront on the banner window but I can't find anything in MUI that would expose the main window OnActivate/OnFocus event that I would need to handle to achieve this.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
