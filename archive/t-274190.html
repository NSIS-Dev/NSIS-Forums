<br />
- I need to have a page on my installer which shows the default IE proxy settings. Also it prompts the user to use the default proxy settings/feed in his own values for the proxy. I am unable to figure out how to do this.<br />
<br />
- It is probable that my installer will be distributed as files in a CD drive to respective companies. Presently I am taking files from the C: drive to test my installer. However for CD drive installation it has to change to that particular drive. I know its something to do with 'GetDrives' but being very new, I am unable to understand how to go about the code for this.<br />
<br />
Please advice. Thanks a lot for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Yep GetDrives is a good option, if you want to spend some time to check out the documentation and the provided examples.<br />
However, there are a couple of related plugins at wiki.</div></div><hr />
