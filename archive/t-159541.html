You can download it here (http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=856).  If you find something that I've missed, things you think should be changed, or, find it useful at all, please let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">13th December 2003, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">DirVerify, GetInstDirError, Nop, LangString, UninstPage, UninstIcon, SetBrandingImage, the /a switch for File, the /e switch for SubSection, the /o switch for Section, $PLUGINSDIR, !ifmacrodef, !ifmacrondef, IDD_LICENSE_FSRB, IDD_LICENSE_FSCB, the /FINAL switch for SetCompressor and the /SD switch for MessageBox are missing. InitPluginsDir, IfSilent, CreateFont and SetCtlColors are not attributes, they're commands. EnabledBitmap and DisabledBitmap are obselete. LoadLanguageFile is an instruction, it's... hmm... atrribute? Uninstaller now has un.onMouseOverSection and un.onSelChange too. There is no un.onInstSuccess and un.onInstFailed, it's un.onUninstSuccess and un.onUninstFailed. It might also be worth getting ${__FILE__}, ${__LINE__}, ${__DATE__}, ${__TIME__} and ${__TIMESTAMP__} in there.</div></div><hr />

DirVerify, UninstPage, GetInstDirError. <br />
I couldn't find these in the documentation.  Do they really exist?  The rest have been added.<br />

Those are covered by the highlighting for symbols.  Unless you think they should be something else?  The new version is now available at the same location.<br />

No, symbols is a good place for those. I just thought you might want to highlight them differently.</div></div><hr />
