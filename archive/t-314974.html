<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beaglelander</div><div class="date">30th November 2009, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting the dreaded &quot;This program might not have been installed correctly&quot; message when running an NSIS exe on Vista / Win7.  Note: the exe is not an installer, I use it to launch my application.<br />
<br />
Before I get flamed to death, I do realise this question has been asked before, and the solution to everyone else's problem seems to use RequestExecutionLevel but that doesn't seem to work.<br />
<br />
Here is an example of my problem:<br />
<br />
Name &quot;Tester&quot;<br />
Caption &quot;Tester&quot;<br />
OutFile &quot;tester.exe&quot;<br />
RequestExecutionLevel highest<br />
<br />
SilentInstall silent<br />
AutoCloseWindow true<br />
ShowInstDetails nevershow<br />
<br />
Section &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Hello World!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Quit<br />
  <br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
I have also tried RequestExecutionLevel admin &amp; user but problem remains.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">30th November 2009, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I compiled your sample using NSIS 2.45 and ran it on my Vista system from a standard account ... and did NOT get the &quot;program may not have been installed correctly&quot; message.<br />
<br />
The same thing happened when I ran it from an administrator account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beaglelander</div><div class="date">30th November 2009, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for trying pengyou.  I'm running it on Win7 with UAC enabled (set to default level) and get this message with or without the &quot;RequestExecutionLevel highest&quot; line.<br />
<br />
I've just tried it on a Vista machine (setup a new user account with UAC) and I do not get the message with the &quot;RequestExecutionLevel highest&quot; line included, but when I remove it I DO get the message.<br />
<br />
So this would seem to imply that the line fixes it on Vista, but not on Win7...  Oh dear.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else with Win7 give this try?  If this is a problem with NSIS/Win7 then it's something we're all going to have to contend with sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">30th November 2009, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using NSIS 2.45? If you are using an earlier release then you'll have problems with Windows 7 because earlier releases of NSIS do not use the new manifest format that Windows 7 requires. If Windows 7 does not find the right manifest then you'll get that kind of message when you run your &quot;installer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit: I tried running tester.exe (compiled using NSIS 2.45) on Windows 7 RC from a standard account and from an administrator account and did not get any &quot;did not install correctly&quot; messages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beaglelander</div><div class="date">30th November 2009, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah ha!  I've upgraded to 2.45 and you're absolutely right.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your help - problem solved  :-)</div></div><hr />
