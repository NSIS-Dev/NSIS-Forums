<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jisin</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">During the installation, I would like to copy a CD to the hard drive (or select the location where the CD is copied already.) The screen should allow you to locate the the cd and if required, make a new folder to place the files into (or just select where to put it all.) Also, the installer should save where that folder is, since it will be used later in the installation. Thank you for all your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the best way would be to create an InstallOptions dialogue with a DirRequest control. You could have a drop-down list on there also for the user to select his CD drive (you might need to use the System plugin to get a list of drives and then add them to the drop-down using WriteINIStr)<br />
<br />
You'd have to use CopyFiles to copy files and CreateDirectory to create directories (quite obviously).<br />
<br />
E.g.<br />
IfFileExists &quot;$NewFolder\*.*&quot; +2<br />
 CreateDirectory &quot;$NewFolder&quot;<br />
CopyFiles /r &quot;$CDDrive&quot; &quot;$NewFolder&quot;<br />
<br />

I am use to C programming, can't figure any of this out. I've read the entire manual, went through the forum and reviewed all the examples. And I still have no idea what I'm doing. Is there a step by step tutorial somewhere out there?</div></div><hr />
