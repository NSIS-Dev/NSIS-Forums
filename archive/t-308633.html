<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">20th July 2009, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">since i'm using win7 rc (x64), i have run into a couple of problems using nsExec. in some cases it works (running .exe from $PLUGINSDIR), in others it doesn't (running .exe from $PROGRAMFILES).<br />
<br />
i assume, that i need to use the UAC plugin to fix this. however, i have built in support for parameters into my installer. when i launch my installer with UAC, it keeps on telling me that i launched it with a wrong/unknown parameter. <br />
<br />
it seems uac launched another instance of my installer, according to the warning it does so with a parameter unknown to my installer. another question would be how to pass on parameter i'm launching my install with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm not so unhappy, i don't have to use UAC - still i'm looking for a solution. i noticed the same problem happening in another script, both use RequestExecutionLevel admin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">20th July 2009, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not sure what the best way to give more clues. i can't reproduce the problem in a reduced installer, and the full script has nearly 3000 lines.<br />
<br />
i tested the installer on win 2008 server (x64) and get the same problems. in the process explorer i can see the application is launched, but it doesn't react. i can run a different application from the same folder. on 32-bit win xp i don't have any problems.</div></div><hr />
