<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgzuck</div><div class="date">6th June 2002, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an exe made with NSIS.<br />
It is called as part of a larger install process from a batch file.<br />
The steps after the nsis exe is called rely on it running to completion first, howver, the nsis file does not hold onto the command console, so the next step starts right away, instead of waiting.  Is there any way around this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">6th June 2002, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe there are batch commands to execute a file and wait for it to return (like ExecWait in NSIS), but I do not know this.<br />
<br />
The solution I would suggest is that you convert the batch file into NSIS script. NSIS can do most of the things and more (and has a nice GUI instead of a command window). Do this by creating a script for the batch file and call the other NSIS script using ExecWait of just build one big installer.<br />
<br />
But as I said, maybe there's a command like ExecWait...<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
