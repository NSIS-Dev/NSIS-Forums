<br />
I Have a dll file which doesn't have version info tablesheet, when I try to compile a script installer using upgrade a DLL macro, it return an error since my dll doesn't have version info tablesheet.<br />
<br />
How can I add version info into my DLL file ? (just to set a dummy version to make upgrade DLL macro work), or <br />
is there any error trap to ignore upgrade DLL macro from detecting a DLL that doesn't have version information ?<br />
<br />
I have search the forum, but I only found &quot;Adding a Windows Version Info Tabsheets to NSIS installer executables&quot; topics. Looks like it doesn't solve my problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, your information is valuable for me.<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
However, try to register your dll on your system to find out if your dll could/should be registered or not. If not you wont have to use the dll macro - you just could copy it to the destination path.<br />
Just run the following command in START &gt; RUN:<br />
<br />
regsvr32.exe &quot;[YourPathToDLL]\yourdll.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
You will get a message which says, if the registering was successful or not. If not you just could copy your file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the dll was loaded, but the DllRegisterServer entry point was not found.<br />
This file can not be registered<br />
<br />
Do I have to just copy to the system directory without registering ???</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">4th July 2005, 09:47</div></div><div class="posttext">one could theoretically patch a DLL to add Version resource. But since you are new to it, it will cost you some effort to undersand this technique. <br />
<br />
Basicly you can take a resource editor and add Version resource and than save the DLL again.<br />
<br />
Your second option is to do a MD5 Checksum on the DLL to see if it another version an couple the MD5 Checksum to the version in a valuetable in you installerscript.<br />
<br />
Success</div></div><hr />
