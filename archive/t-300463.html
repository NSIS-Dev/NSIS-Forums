<br />
Are there any plans of making a native x64 version of NSIS?<br />
<br />
I don't like to run regsvr32 to register a dll, not to mention that I have to pollute the NSI file with !if directives to set SetRegView 64 etc.<br />
<br />
I would like to have only one script which would create the right installer for every platform.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm not the only one who thinks this way, see 7-zip, the author used MSI for 64 bit installer.<br />
<br />

If all you want is to access the 64 bit registry and programfiles, there is no need, the 32 bit version can do that</div></div><hr />

Not only that, but it can be installed without WOW64 meaning that ONLY a native 64-bit installer will work.<br />

Native 64-bit binaries will become a very important requirement for us very soon.</div></div><hr />

That is really cool, but I don't believe 32-bit drivers were ever feasible in 64-bit, nor 16-bit drivers in 32-bit Windows.<br />
<br />
I'm not allowed to post URLs yet? ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">byteboon</div><div class="date">11th May 2009, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, without a 32-bit version and without Wow64 on a 64-bit version you won't be able to run 32-bit code at all... NSIS installers will fail to execute entirely. Drivers aren't my concern--exe's are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalverson</div><div class="date">15th May 2009, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">There is probably still plenty of time before being forced to use a x64 version of NSIS.  The next version of Windows does include Wow64; it is just optional to remove it or install the OS without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">byteboon</div><div class="date">15th May 2009, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">For most, yes, but our software needs to work on the existing configuration of the system it is being installed on (for support purposes). For *us* this is a big issue because we *can't* require WoW64.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anandsunku</div><div class="date">7th October 2011, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a dll built for 64 bit compilation, i used makensis and makensisw(from scratchpaper),<br />
i could not call the function in the 64 bit dll. <br />
<br />
the same dll when compiled in 32 bit , it is able to compile properly.<br />
<br />
i think the function calling stack between 32 bit installer ( target -&gt; output from makensis) and the 64 bit dll function is a problem.<br />
<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">7th October 2011, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Calling 64-Bit DLL's from a 32-Bit process doesn't work. And probably never will work. Forget about that!<br />
<br />
As NSIS is 32-Bit, calling a 64-Bit DLL directly from your NSIS installer is a lost case - unless there ever will be a native 64-Bit version of NSIS. But currently it doesn't look like that. Even Unicode support, which IMHO is much more important, still is a work in progress...<br />
<br />
Anyway, while you cannot load 64-Bit DLL's, you can run 64-Bit processes! So simply put the code into an EXE that you can run from you installer, instead of putting it into a DLL. Or, if you have to use the DLL, make a simple stub 64-Bit EXE that will call your DLL.</div></div><hr />
