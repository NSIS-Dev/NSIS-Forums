<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nightmarez</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll admit that I'm not that skilled of a programmer, I've looked over the NSIS docs tons of times but I can't quite get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
I simply want to make an installer for my program, but I can't quite figure it all out, if someone could post a basic template that goes as follows, I'm sure it would help out a lot of us new users.<br />
<br />
Installer:<br />
[Program Info (Name, licence, author, etc)]<br />
[Install Directory]<br />
[Files to Install]<br />
[Start Menu Integration]<br />
[DLL files (UpdateDLL macro example) or files to install after a reboot]<br />
[Uninstaller]<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'm forgetting a few details, but if someone could make a template that would allow us newbies to simply input the options we want, we could learn a lot from it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't have them you have probably not selected &quot;NSIS Examples (recommended)&quot; when you installed NSIS (it is marked by default).<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and of course:<br />
To have a template .nsi generated to your needs, go here (http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/makensitemplate.phtml). <br />
 - From the docs...</div></div><hr />
