<br />
is it possible to control at installation time how the uninstaller is written? My problem is that I cannot use any file or registry to configurate the uninstaller. At compile time I know there is a limited number of possible uninstaller configurations. During the installation I get the information which Uninstaller is needed. How can I write a specific uninstaller? Is it possible to define a specific uninstall section when I call WriteUninstaller?</div></div><hr />

What I need is to write different uninstaller depending on the conditions detected during installation. If a uninstaller has been written it should not be configurable anymore. The set of uninstallers is limited to a few number.</div></div><hr />
