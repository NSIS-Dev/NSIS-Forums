<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbplayr2000</div><div class="date">2nd October 2008, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found several references to checking the JRE in the examples and forums (see links below), but have not had success using NSIS 2.39.  <br />
<br />
I've tried to mesh the solutions found online with the script generated by EclipseNSIS, but am not sure how to make the association with 'jre.ini'. The examples use a 'jre.ini' file.  However, it appears that the latest version of NSIS does not support that method and recommends using nsDialogs instead.<br />
<br />
I've attached what I've come up with for a .nsi file.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an example of doing a JRE check/install using the nsDialogs?<br />
<br />
Even better, if anyone knows how this is done through the EclipseNSIS plugin, that would be great too!<br />
<br />

<br />
I've gotten the check to work, and I believe I've even gotten the download of the JRE to work, however, I am having a permissions issue with the temp directory that the jre is written to.  I need a way to give the IUSR permissions to write to the temp directory.  The local user would have admin rights to read it and install it.<br />
<br />
Any help in getting the permissions set for the download of the JRE would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

I'm having the same issue as your initial question and am having trouble finding any help.  Surely somebody is doing this -would think that this would be a common need!  Thanks...</div></div><hr />
