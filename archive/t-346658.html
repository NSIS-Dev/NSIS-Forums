<br />
Currently I was told to develop a new installation package for our product and the original installation package was written by custom control which belongs one part of our UI lib, so<br />
is it possible to reuse the existing UI element rather than convert them into NSIS script?<br />
And if it could be reached by plugin and I wonder whether it's a time-consuming or a tough task?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T.Slappy</div><div class="date">30th July 2012, 06:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Is your UI lib some C, C++, Delphi (...) plug-in (.dll) or an application?<br />
If so the it can be used in NSIS very easily!<br />
<br />
(here I suppose your plug-in can be called from main installer [with some parameters] and it asks for some values and performs some tasks then it quits)<br />
<br />
But if you want to convert your &lt;some-installation-system-name&gt; installer into NSIS script there is no &lt;converter&gt; or similar tool which makes it easier for you - everything has to be written manually.</div></div><hr />

That's what I wonder, so the least painful way for me is to wrapper those needed custom page as a plugin and call them from nsis script. uh, i'm new to NSIS, so as far as I know there are at least 3 ways to manipulate the UI layout and elements:<br />
<br />
1. pure NSIS script<br />
2. ini file and combined with InstallOption plugin<br />
3. encapsule the dll as plugin and call them from nsis script</div></div><hr />

There are some plug-ins which have their custom UI  - e.g. http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in adds own dialog into installer.<br />
You plug-in should do the same.</div></div><hr />
