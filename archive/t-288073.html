<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acelango</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm a newbie to NSIS and having trouble finding help on the following.<br />
<br />
I have a tomcat nsi script where it has the line:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE INSTALLLICENSE<br />
<br />
I've searched the forum to find what INSTALLLICENSE is pointing to but to no avail. Could one of you please help me understand this? Where is this INSTALLLICENSE variable defined? Thanks much in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">INSTALLLICENSE is a file that should be located in the installer script's directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acelango</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick reply. The directory that has tomcat.nsi has a file by name &quot;LICENSE&quot;. I see that this file is being picked up and displayed correctly in the installer screen, just not sure how specifying INSTALLLICENSE is picking up this file.<br />
<br />
Also, not sure about the significance of the following lines in the script. There is no file by name License.rtf in the directory where tomcat.nsi is present but the installer build is not erroring out.<br />
<br />
;License dialog<br />
LicenseData License.rtf<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Both INSTALLLICENSE and License.rtf must exist for the script to build properly. They might be created in some pre-build step and deleted right after the installer is built. Unless that code is somehow commented out, the installer will not build if the file doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />
