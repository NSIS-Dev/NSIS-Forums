<br />
I tried to read as much as possible about NSIS, to see if it meets the requirements I have. I still have some questions and maybe smbd can answer them:<br />
<br />
1) I read that it can do: give to the tool a bunch of files for instance: myapp.exe, setup.exe (installer intelligence), myapp.dll, etc and those can be packed together on a Linux system and it will generate a Windows binary that when run on Windows will run the file setup.exe packed inside.<br />
Is the above correct?<br />
<br />
2) Is NSIS able to provide updates in a pacth format? Meaning apply just a diff to the files?<br />
<br />
3) What happens if an update needs to be applied and some files are in use?<br />
<br />
4) Can I somehow force an &quot;always overwrite&quot; flag for the files to be installed? I mean if the files are found in the destination directory to be always overwritten by the ones from the package?<br />
<br />
5) Can I get 2 different builds:<br />
- one, where everything is compressed into one .exe file, including myapp files<br />
- one that is not compressed, meaning I get the setup.exe containing the installer inteligence and the other files like myapp files outside from the installer exe<br />
<br />
6) Is there a wizard that I could use to generate a basic installer? Or do I have to manually write from the scratch a script file?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Vivi</div></div><hr />

Yes, see Docs\VPatch. You can use the Library macros to handle updating of in-use DLLs. See Appendix B of the docuemntation. Yes, see SetOverwrite. Yes, see SetCompress. Yes, see the Wiki (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Category:Development_Environments). There are more available, that's just a partial list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've found this forum to be very active and incredibly helpful ... and patient with newbies (and users who have gotten rusty).<br />
<br />
This is something of an intangible, but, IMO, nsis has tremendous support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your answers. As it seems NSIS meets by basic requirements, I'll start playing with it a little.<br />
<br />
One more question: I read that the silent feature is by default in. I assume it doesn't show any dialog and uses the default values for everything in the script. Still is there a way an admin (that needs to deply the sw in a company) to overwrite those default settings that were decided in the first place by the developer?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Viv</div></div><hr />
