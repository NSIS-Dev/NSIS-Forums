<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurleen</div><div class="date">13th October 2004, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to install a program  as an admin because I need to look at various system properties. I have the installer ready , the problem I am getting is that a normal user can't use the installed program because he/she does not have rights to read/write to files that the installer(as an admin) copied to the system.<br />
Is there any flag that I can use to set the installation for any user of the system rather than the user which installs the program.<br />
<br />
I was looking through the Help files I and found this command ---&gt; SetShellVarContext<br />
would this command beenough to make it happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just posted 10 mins earlier about this.<br />
<br />
but this may not be a problem in your case.<br />
<br />
<br />
After re-reading your post, I found that you are asking a slightly different question than I thought, you need to run the installation as administrator, otherwise normal users cannot write to the places you want.<br />
Using 'SetShellVarContext All' will just make the installation use the All users directory instead of the logged in (or run as) user.</div></div><hr />
