<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">i've seen a couple threads in the past about this with no resolution<br />
<br />
is it possible to disable the agree box until the user has scrolled to the bottom of the license agreement?<br />
<br />
common lawyer advise is to now a) force a scroll and b) force them to type something such as 'i agree' as opposed to having something clickable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">31st January 2003, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This was discussed pretty fully on the forum before in detail. Personally I can't understand how it makes any difference what you make the user do, all you achieve is being a royal pain in the neck. They say yes one way or another and they either mean it or they don't, nothing you do will improve this situation for you but anything you do *will* annoy the user more... so why bother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">31st January 2003, 05:10</div></div><div class="posttext">because it's RECOMMENDED BY LAWYERS.  a software patent / ip / etc lawyer said under no uncertain terms that if you want to stand a chance in the present climate of case law, you have to do it :(<br />
<br />
look i know we all just scroll to the bottom and move on - just like we sign releases at the hospital without analyzing them.  it's apparently a necessary evil at this point.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps that funtionality would be better served for doing in the application on the users first run.  Especially since the user that installs it is not necessarily the user that uses it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">31st January 2003, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll be a nice feature to force the licence doc to be scroll, because the installer will know that end-user read it, and, as a add, the end-user will accept the terms, requirements, etc., files, an other goodies from the current installer because he read and ACCEPT the license...<br />
But also like Sunjammer said:<br />
royal pain in the neck<br />
it could be reading the hole boring text......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunjammer is right: it's a royal pain in the neck, but it should be possible (or by using a custom license page plugin, or by using an instruction in NSIS), since I think that developers will not use NSIS when there is a possibility that they have to show up in court and lose the case because of the fact that he didn't force the users to read the agreement, or something.<br />
It sounds stupid, but this seems to be a world where they can sue a  microwave company when they did not write in their manual that it isn't a good idea to put a little dog in the microwave when he's wet. :eek: :eek: :eek: <br />
<br />
Think about it. Discussion re-opened!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">For example: Some users cry because for the horrible Ad-ware.<br />
Some App, like Kazaalite, Audiogalaxy, etc., use the the readme or the license (or in another dialog) page to inform the user that the current installer has additional files....<br />
For some Nsis users may be i'll be a nice feature the Force to scroll because the end-user will read what's going to install...<br />
and you don't to write pages and pages of boring text :)....<br />
Well, that's my point of view...<br />
Note: I'm not a Ad-ware programmer :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not proposing that it's a mandate - just an option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded a program sometime ago (i can't remember what), but the license page started with the most important things, that differ from the standard licenses, and then came the rest. When I really have to read a license, I'll read a license with interesting info at the top sooner than a 4 page long license with nonsence and sence between it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">i really think there should be a 'standard' software license that applies to every piece of software there is<br />
<br />
statements about no explicit guarantees, use at your own peril, etc etc.  if somebody needs something in ADDITION to the regular stuff, they could make another license page (or preferrably a series of concise yes/no questions that really let the user know what they're getting into)<br />
<br />
i'm looking forward to the day that click-through stuff gets challenged in court</div></div><hr />

<br />
No thank you.  I'll stick with the freedom of choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 06:06</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm clearly referring to the completely generic parts.<br />
<br />
i'm sure there isn't a software vendor on the face of the planet that would LIKE to include a guarantee that if any harm is done to the pc that they would be responsible, etc.  this is not a limitation in choice.</div></div><hr />
