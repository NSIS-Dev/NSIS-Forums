<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cervezas</div><div class="date">6th January 2006, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">It was asked back in May 2004 if there was a way to make a custom page that has a list of checkboxes similar to the components list: see here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=179462&amp;highlight=checkbox+AND+list) <br />
<br />
I have a similar requirement to the user who posed that question: the list needs to be something that can be populated at runtime, needs to display in its own page, and needs to be scrollable since for a certain number of users it could contain dozens of items.<br />
<br />
Is the answer to this still that you have to use the System plugin and Win32 APIs to create this or is it now possible to do this with InstallOptions?  (If someone can point to an example of something similar to this, of course that would be great!)</div></div><hr />

This is not exactly what I wanted, but it is close enough and I think I can make it work.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">If you wanted something identical to the tree view control on the components page, I could add that as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alient</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">What I need is the additional ability to set the state of the checkboxes that is in the list. One of my checkbox is the parent of all the other checkboxes, so its state affects all other checkboxes' state. If the parent is checked, all the rest need to be marked as checked. If the parent is unchecked, all the rest should also be unchecked so that the user can check them individually. Is that possible?<br />
<br />
Also it would be nice to be able to use checkboxes that without using the MultiColumn.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">It uses a syslistview32 control, not a systreeview32 control.<br />
You can't have child items under parent items in a list view control. The plugin would have to be expanded to add support for a dialog with a tree view control.<br />
<br />
To set an items' state to checked, add a + in front of the item name.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alient</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">The parent/child relationship is something I can manage, I don't need the view to display child under parent only when parent is expanded. So treeview control is not required for now, but might be nice to have in the future.<br />
<br />
The ability to set the state of the checkbox is a big help!<br />
Is it hard to enable checkboxes w/o using MultiColumn?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick reply!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible, but not without adding another dialog resource which will add to the plugin size. List view controls support different list styles but unfortunately the list style cannot be changed dynamically at run time.<br />
<br />
I would like to add treeview support as it's one thing that would be very useful. I might even add list images too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Open the source code in Visual Studio 6 or .NET and open EmbeddedLists.rc. You want the IDC_MULTICOLUMN dialog and you need to change the list view control View property from Report to List. Make sure the build configuration is set to Release and not Debug. If you build from Contrib\EmbeddedLists\ the plugin will be put in the Plugins folder directly. You should be able to ommit the /HEADINGS parameter altogether when calling the plugin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alient</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The project depends on exdll.h which is not included in the original zip file. Can you please provide me the missing files? Thanks!<br />

Compilation Error:<br />
Cannot open include file: '..\ExDll\exdll.h'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">19th May 2006, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It's in the NSIS source distribution, but here it is anyway.<br />
Rename to exdll.h and place in Contrib\ExDLL.<br />
<br />
I've been working on the new version. So far I've added support for check boxes on all types of lists; column widths can now be changed; headings can be removed via plugin parameters; item texts can be edited and item sorting has been added.<br />
<br />
There is now only one resource instead of three.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow I will add tree view support and perhaps list item icons as well.<br />

<br />
If you find that items don't appear selected in the order that you have them set in the INI file, then that'd be Sort=1 in action.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeh3</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, in fact the extra &quot;Pop $R0&quot; was the culprit for multiselect issues. In TreeView_Basic example if I try to select one item, it remains unselected and $R0 is /END after popping; in TreeView_LabelEdit example, if I select one item, no message appears indicatiing it as selected and $R0 is /END after popping.</div></div><hr />

TreeView items are now selectable by default.<br />
They cannot be selected with NoItemSelection=1.<br />
