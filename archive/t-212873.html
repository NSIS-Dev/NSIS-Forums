<br />
Installer try to overwrite some files during setup. A new version of file &quot;A&quot; depends on new version of file &quot;B&quot;. If we update first file &quot;A&quot; we MUST update second file &quot;B&quot; -otherwise application will be crashed :(<br />
But &quot;B&quot; may by in use and &quot;A&quot; - not. We overwrite ONLY &quot;A&quot; just now and get crashed app :(<br />
<br />
Only one desision : overvrite ALL files on reboot (RebootOK options) in ONE transaction. <br />
<br />
How to left ALL files (in use, not in use - doesn't matter) overwrite on reboot?</div></div><hr />

Hi Romko,<br />
<br />
you best best, I think, is to copy file A and B under different name, A2 and B2 for example, and try to rename them to A and B with the /REBOOTOK flag.<br />
<br />
It may do the trick if read the Rename instruction entry in the documentation correctly. ;) Please, let me know if it works.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Hi KenA,<br />
<br />
For example A - in use, B - not in use<br />
create ne files A2 B2<br />
rename /rebootok A2 A<br />
rename /rebootok B2 B<br />
B will be overwrite just now, A - will be overwrite ON REBOOT. I need overwrite A and B file TOGETHER ON REBOOT</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, this probably won't work if your program is in use as Windows boots up...<br />

Hi KenA,<br />
<br />
It was my mistake about RENAME using :) RENAME doesn't check file locking, it checks exist file or not and left all file on reboot if they exists. What I want :)</div></div><hr />
