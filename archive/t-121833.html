<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ein</div><div class="date">18th January 2003, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I know it's possible for text file or using VPatch with known files.<br />
However, if I want to make a patch that search for a 85c0752f6a01 and replace it with 85c090906a01, without knownledge of the file to patch (i.e. patching a .acm file, that version update is out of my control, yet I want to make a easy way to hexedit the specific bytes) Is it possible to do it with NSIS and the plugin availble?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th January 2003, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS itself can't edit binary files and there is no plug-in that does that I know of. You will have to write your own plug-in.<br />
<br />
BTW, how can you be sure that 85c0752f6a01 doesn't show in the file more than once and that other time it shows in the file should be edited too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ein</div><div class="date">19th January 2003, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to use NSIS to patch files like msaud32.acm or uxtheme.dll<br />
What I'm trying to do is just removing the checking routine so normal version upgrade does not have much affect on it (unless they try to change the checking procedure). And that hack worked for WMP6,7,8,9 (except the position of code changes)</div></div><hr />
