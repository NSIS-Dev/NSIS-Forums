<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">motion157</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just wondering how easy it would be<br />
to create custom dialogs in the installer.<br />
Right now, I'm using the modern UI.  I would like to create an entirely new set of dialogs that are, in a way, skinned.  I realize that I'd have to create them in C++, but that's cool.  Is there a spec I can follow for resource and dialog names?    Is there any tutorial out there for doing such a thing?<br />
<br />
What my company wants is a fully skinned installer, which means the dialog wouldn't even look like a typical windows dialog.  The buttons would be skinned, and so would the min/max/close buttons.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as far as I know, to skin a window you have to respond to Windows messages such as WM_PAINT and paint it yourself. For that, you can create a plug-in that will take over the windows procedure of NSIS and load it using /NOUNLOAD. You'll also have to know whenever a new dialog or a button is created and take over those too. I won't call it easy, but not much harder than regular skinning either. This has never been done as far as I know, and so there aren't any tutorials or examples available. If you do this eventually I would love seeing the results. If you need any help with creating the plug-in, or even changing the source code if you find it easier don't hesitate to ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna try to paint the Installer dialog, need some help:<br />
I'm starting with this (take from the brand text):<br />
<br />
GetDlgItem $R0 $HWNDPARENT 1028 <br />
;1028 is brand-text, what's for the hole installer dialog<br />
CreateFont $R1 &quot;Tahoma&quot; 10 700<br />
SendMessage $R0 ${WM_PAINT} $R1 0</div></div><hr />

To set the font you need to send ${WM_SETFONT}.</div></div><hr />
