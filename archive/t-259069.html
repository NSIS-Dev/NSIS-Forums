<br />
I want to use a small dialog that pops up after using the startmenu link to control certain application start/stop features. I would like a small dialog (150x150 pixels) with a title, a small picture (Logo) below, followed by a progressbar and two buttons below as well. Just a small control GUI that stays opened during application execution. <br />
<br />
I will use the progressbar it to show start of an application server in the background, the buttons control the start of a browser and the shutdown of the application server. I don't need back, abort, cancel and multiple pages. But I intend to use the leave function to return to the page after clicking my &quot;Start Browser&quot; button to keep the the  <br />
<br />
I tried to do this with the &quot;page instfiles&quot; to get the progressbar. But this gets too big and it has the MUI/Classic installer look. I am familiar with MUI and custom dialogs using InstallOptions.<br />
<br />
I have seen AutoIt3 and it looks promising for that (http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3).  BUT is there something similar in NSIS regarding those AutoIt3 custom dialogs???<br />
<br />
I know that it is not the main purpose of NSIS, but I would be nice, if I can do this with NSIS too. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

It is really simple to create a small dialog with some controls and make them handle events. Basically it has a lot that NSIS offers too. But I won't do my installation steps with it. I want to stick with NSIS.</div></div><hr />
