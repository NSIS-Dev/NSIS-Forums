<br />
I am installing my drivers using NSIS and a third party program. When I start installing the drivers, the Hardware Found Wizard pops up, but as soon as the third party installation finishes, it just disappears. Is there a way to hide the Hardware found wizard?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jaime</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the late reply, it does not seem to be a hide function.<br />
<br />
I tried to use a big background that covered all this screen, but since it is not blocking, sometimes pops the hardware wizard on top of the installer. Any other ideas in mind?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">1st June 2011, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Use FindWindow along with ShowWindow + ${SW_HIDE} (both are NSIS instructions). The issue you will have though is that the window title will probably change depending on the language. Your other problem is that you would need to use Exec rather than ExecWait to run your 3rd party program/installation. You can probably keep checking if the installation is complete by trying to delete the executable and checking the error flag (in a loop with said code). The changing window title is still a problem though.<br />

Thank you for the info.<br />
<br />
I was planning to implement your suggestion, but then I realized that the main source of confusion for the users is the wizard appears every time a card is inserted. So, they do not even try out the installer.<br />
<br />
It seems that the best &quot;pseudo-solution&quot; is to guide the users to first install the drivers and then insert the pci card. This will avoid the hardware wizard. It is not a bullet proof approach since the user still can screw it up by inserting first the PCI card (which would be the natural thing for me).<br />
<br />
That said, thank you for the reply.<br />

Actually lots of hardware nowadays warns to ALWAYS FIRST INSTALL THE DRIVERS BEFORE PLUGGING IN!!!111z0mg etc, so it's not that far of a stretch. And any tech-savvy user will still be able to do it his own way, so no harm done.</div></div><hr />
