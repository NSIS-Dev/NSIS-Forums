<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">2nd August 2002, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
all good things come to an end. Unfortunately, I will not have time enough in the future to continue my work for the NSIS community. My new job, another Forum that I should admin and mod as part of this new job and changes in personal life made me decide that I should hand over my modding rights to a good successor.<br />
<br />
I have chosen KiCHiK to be my successor. The reasons might be clear, but let's write some of them down. KiCHiK<br />
 helped me out modding this Forum when I was away.<br />
 has a lot of experience with NSIS.<br />
 knows all about scripting in NSIS.<br />
 works actively on developing NSIS.<br />
 knows a lot about C.<br />
<br />
I guess you will agree that he might become a nice successor.<br />
<br />
I proposed him to be accepted as a new mod in the family of mods and nobody was against it. But actually, no action has been taken by the Forum admin (Steve) to replace me by KiCHiK.<br />
<br />
So there you have it, I cannot mod due to lack of time and KiCHiK cannot mod due to lack of rights (as explained here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=94300)).<br />
<br />
Don't blame it on me that there is no moderator right now! I addressed the topic on 26-7 but nothing has happened since (apart from approving reactions from other mods). I hope this situation will be solved very, very soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the nice contributions you have made on this Forum to help other people out. Please continue doing so. Some nice things have been developed already and I would love to see that NSIS will grow even further by the contributions of the whole NSIS community.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't forget, enjoy the smile,<br />
wherever you are.<br />
<br />
Have fun, greetz,<br />
