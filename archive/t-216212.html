<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">16th May 2005, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">at last i tried some methods to free dll from memory, but not <br />
everytime successful.<br />
unregdll or regsvr32 /u dont work - the dll are still not deletable.<br />
<br />
furthermore i am not familiar to system:free (system.dll) and <br />
how far it is usable for me.<br />
<br />
it must be possible because i had an uninstaller here which <br />
did it.<br />
<br />
please help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am in the same situation: during install I register a dll which adds context menu entries to Windows Explorer. Everything works fine. During uninstall I unregister the dll but I cannot remove it; Windows Explorer does not free/unload the dll.<br />
<br />
Is there any work around for this?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I also see that this is a very old thread. (there's my posting and everything :o)</div></div><hr />
