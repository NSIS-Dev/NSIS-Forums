<br />
I'm starting with a script that was generated by the EclipsePlugIn that utilizes the ModernUI. This was then modified by a nsis newbie and then I have been trying to get it to work (and I am certainly no expert). There is a fair amount of :winamp: &quot;magic&quot; :winamp: that is over my head. I'd prefer not to get &quot;up to speed&quot; with the EclipsePlugIn, so thought I would be lazy and ask the ever-helpful nsis experts.<br />
<br />
Several of the sections have -Main and -post. Do these have special significance with Eclipse and/or the MUI? With &quot;standard&quot; nsis, I've done a little with pre-function, show-function, and leave-function callbacks, and thought &quot;main&quot; and &quot;post&quot; might be related to this.<br />
<br />
The script also set a registry string for &quot;Main&quot; which may or may not be coincidental.<br />
<br />
Section -Main SEC0000<br />
  ; .... some statements<br />
  WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;${REGKEY}\Components&quot; Main 1<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section /o un.Main UNSEC0000<br />
  ; .... some statements<br />
  DeleteRegValue HKLM &quot;${BCS_REGKEY}\Components&quot; Main<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section -post SEC0001<br />
SectionEnd</div></div><hr />

The &quot;Main&quot; section is the default section generated by the EclipseNSIS wizard. It is set to be hidden by default (which is why it has the &quot;-&quot; prefix). You can change its name to anything you wish in the wizard Installer Contents page and make it visible if you wish. <br />
The &quot;post&quot; section is generated behind the scenes by EclipseNSIS wizard. It is used to perform any essential &amp; required post-installation tasks. Again, it is hidden which is why it has the &quot;-&quot; prefix.<br />
The reason the registry strings are set is so that the uninstaller knows that it should uninstall anything that was installed in that section. <br />
A registry string is set for every section which appears in the Installer Contents page. <br />
That way the user can choose whichever section(s) she/he wishes to install and the uninstaller knows what it has to uninstall.<br />
The wizard is targeted at the novice NSIS developer- as a convenient way to quickly create a working NSIS installer. More accomplished users can then tweak and tune the resulting script as much as they wish.<br />
<br />
BTW, the ${BCS_REGKEY} in your Section un.Main doesn't look right to me. Unless it is defined to be the same as ${REGKEY} you are going to wind up with residual entries in the registry after uninstallation.<br />
<br />
If you can provide more details of the exact problems you are facing with the script, I am sure you will get plenty of help in this forum.</div></div><hr />

Good catch ... carelessness on my part writing the post. It is not still that way in the actual script.<br />
<br />
The reason the registry strings are set is so that the uninstaller knows that it should uninstall anything that was installed in that section.  <br />
<br />
My impression is that the wizard generates these statements for uninstalling, but further modifications can cause this to get &quot;out of sync&quot; ... or does the EclipsePlugin keep track of this?</div></div><hr />

Once the script is created you are on your own. :)</div></div><hr />
