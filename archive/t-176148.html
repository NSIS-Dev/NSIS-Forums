The value string is really long (4,800 characters), is there a maximum string length or something? I've tried to insert backslashes, but that didn't work either.<br />
I attached the command, for the experts to look at.</div></div><hr />

&quot;4c69442a092f003c8b2...[etc] is not a valid command&quot;<br />
<br />
I removed that point on from the string and it worked fine. For some reason it is only taking 4,034 characters instead of 8,916. Am I doing something wrong or is there a bug in the special build?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
I fixed my problem. Apparently the 4,034 character has to be a backslash. I'm guessing that the compiler makes a new line every 4,034 characters. But I really know nothing about programming, so maybe someone else could answer that question. Perhaps it's a bug, perhaps I'm doing something wrong. Thanks again Joost.<br />
<br />
Edit Again:<br />
Sorry, but I keep discovering more. Actually it's the 4,095 character that needs to be a backslash--I forgot to include a few things in my character count.</div></div><hr />
