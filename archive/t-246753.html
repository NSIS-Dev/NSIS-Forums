<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JeronimoColon</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I have begun to break out a fair amount of code into &quot;Helper Libraries&quot; using .nsh files because my latest installer is over 1500 lines and much of it can be re-used in future installers.  With that said, I'm having a problem with nested !includes.<br />
<br />
The main .nsi file has a !include for &quot;FileFunc.nsh&quot; as well as one of my custom .nsh files.  When I compile I get an error:<br />
<br />
!define: &quot;FILEFUNC_VERBOSE&quot; already defined!<br />
!include: error in script: &quot;C:\Program Files\NSIS\Include\FileFunc.nsh&quot; on line 82<br />
!include: error in script: &quot;MSILibrary.nsh&quot; on line 6<br />
<br />
I'm clearly doing something wrong.  What is the correct way to have a common .nsh file included in multiple files?<br />
<br />
I may break these libraries out further to even more descrete tasks so there may be a .nsh file !including another .nsh file and both sharing a common .nsh file.<br />
<br />
As an aside: This is kinda why I created a post earlier about &quot;Best Practices&quot; for larger installer cause I knew I'd screw this up... :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">A common error when !include headers is if you !include first a header that uses another one.<br />
e.g.<br />
!include &quot;myheader.nsh&quot; ;this header uses LogicLib<br />
!include &quot;LogicLib.nsh&quot;<br />
this is wrong, should be:<br />
!include &quot;LogicLib.nsh&quot;<br />
!include &quot;myheader.nsh&quot;</div></div><hr />

I made the changes you suggested but it didn't solve this particular problem, but at least I know going forward.<br />
<br />
Thank you Instructor! - The corrected versions of the .nsh files in the link you provided did the trick!<br />
<br />
I take it this will be in the next update of NSIS...<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
