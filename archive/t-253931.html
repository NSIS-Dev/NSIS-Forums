<br />
In the registry at the key &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${PRODUCT_NAME}&quot; is the entry UninstallString which in my case is: &quot;$INSTDIR\uninst.exe&quot;. So when uninstalled from add/remove programs, the uninst.exe will be run with no params and not in silent mode so it will ask for user interaction.<br />
<br />
I am not familiar with &quot;network install&quot;, but afaik in big companies the administrators are using this type of installation, so that it installs the same software on several user's machines without the user interaction. I assume the same is done with uninstalling.<br />
So, in such a scenario, how could the admin uninstall silently the product? (as said I'm not familiar with this procedure). Is there a way for him to find out the $INSTDIR, so that then to call the $INSTDIR\uninst.exe -S?<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">23rd August 2006, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I would probably allow for your own command line parameters and then process them on .onInit (for the install) or un.onInit (for the uninstall).<br />
<br />
The advantage here is that it will allow you to add support for other parameters (such as folder paths, etc.) rather than just being silent or not.<br />
<br />
And for what it's worth:<br />
Most big companies (espeically those that are publicly traded)  that I've worked with have to carefully audit any type of software activity.  (are you familiar with the Sarbanes-Oxley act?  If not, you might Google it to find out more.)<br />
<br />
But, as a result of this, most will usually use MSI-based installations with Active Directory since that gives more control to the administrator of what can get installed and helps them manage permissions granted during an install.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, most also require that any installation or other program is digitally signed to ensure the install is &quot;safe&quot;. <br />
<br />
All these things are still do-able with NSIS, albeit perhaps a little more difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, of course, I will process cmd line params for everything that the user could normally chose in the uninstaller. But my question was a little different: in a  company where the admin wants to silently uninstall the product from several machines, how can he start the uninstaller? how can he find out the path to the uninstaller?<br />
<br />
<br />
And for what it's worth:...<br />
<br />
<br />
In my case, the &quot;big company&quot; will actually build the installer itself, so it will have the script, so can see right away what is done during installing.<br />
<br />
The MSI didn't fit at all our requirements, so we drop that.<br />
<br />
Also, as my installer installs an LSP (layered service provider), it will need admin rights during installing.<br />
<br />
As far as I understood also &quot;normal&quot; exes can be run similar to Active Directory with MSI.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
