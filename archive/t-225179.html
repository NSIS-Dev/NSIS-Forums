<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolando</div><div class="date">3rd September 2005, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried searching the wiki for this and only found a function that can set focus on a custom page control. However, what I'm trying to do is set the focus on the installer's top title and subtitle. My guess is it can be done using the System plugin but I don't know how to do it. Can anyone help ?</div></div><hr />

sure it can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">4th September 2005, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not what Microsoft says (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/staticcontrols/aboutstaticcontrols.asp):<br />
Although static controls are child windows, they cannot be selected. Therefore, they cannot receive the keyboard focus and cannot have a keyboard interface.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolando</div><div class="date">4th September 2005, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">:| could there be a difference between keyfocus and mousefocus ? because if 2 simple lines in VB can do it, I doubt it can't be done. I'm not trying to select it by having the user press the &quot;Tab&quot; button. I just want to set focus on it so that it appears OVER a control which is placed above it by default. Anyway, it's not that important so I might as well drop this topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">4th September 2005, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you want to change the Z-order not focus.<br />
You can call SetWindowPos (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowfunctions/getnextwindow.asp) to do this with the System plugin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolando</div><div class="date">4th September 2005, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here's what I was able to find it... <br />
System::Call &quot;${sysSetWindowPos} (parameters)&quot;<br />
<br />
and as I saw on msdn, I probably need to use HWND_TOP or HWND_TOPMOST as the second paramter... However, I don't know how to obtain the control id or how the rest of the paramters should be. Can you assist me with that please ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">4th September 2005, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">What control is being created over the page title/subtitle?<br />
This should not happen.<br />
Anyway, the best way for you to find the control handles will be to look at the Modern UI macro MUI_HEADER_TEXT which sets the values of the title and subtitle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolando</div><div class="date">4th September 2005, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">it's actually the header image, because I added NO_RESIZE and the title/subtitle appear above the image just fine for all pages except the first one.</div></div><hr />
