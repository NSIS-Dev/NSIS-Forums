What seems to happen when installing from a CD when the File copying starts,  it generates error messages,  stating that windows is using the File(They are file which windows would not be using),  when i view the directory all the files have copied.  Could it be related to the speed of the CD drive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">10th March 2003, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe your trying to copy a file that is already open or in use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th March 2003, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please attach the script so I can test this? Did it happen with earlier versions of NSIS? Does it happen with the latest CVS veresion (use NSIS Update to get it)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ICONICS2000</div><div class="date">10th March 2003, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi kichik,  I can attach the script the only problem it seems that the PC i developed does not show the same problems,  All the other PC's i tested the installation does not show the problems either<br />
<br />
I shipped the CD to a Customer in Dubai,  who experienced problems and to another customer in france who experienced the same problems has the customer DUBAI. I have yet recompile the script in the lastest build.  <br />
<br />
I do not install files which windows might be using,  All i install is some Microsoft Access Databases and a few text files.  I also poke a few entries into the registry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ICONICS2000</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 08:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the script which is causing issues</div></div><hr />
