<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MidnightJava</div><div class="date">15th September 2006, 04:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say that the NSIS documentation is very helpful and well-written, but in trying to convert to MUI I encountered something that I can't make any sense of. For the StartMenu macro, the following instructions are given:<br />
___________________<br />
Put the code to write the shortcuts (using CreateShortcut) between the MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_BEGIN and MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_END macros:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_BEGIN page_id<br />
  ...create shortcuts...<br />
!insertmacro MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_END<br />
The page ID should be the ID of the page on which the user has selected the folder for the shortcuts you want to write.<br />
___________________<br />
<br />
The page where the user selected the folder for the shortcuts I want to write is the Directory page. So how do I define a page_id for the Directory page? MUI has no way to define page_id as far as I can tell, except for this macro. How am I supposed to point the StartMenu macro to another page via page_id, when there is no facility for assigning page_id to any MUI page???<br />
<br />
I searched the index and the documentation for page_id and found nothing. And none of the examples use the construction that I quoted above; but neither do they define shortcut items for the startmenu folder via any other method.<br />
<br />
RESOLVED: This is very confusing language, but I finally figured out that I can create a page_id arbitrarily, so long as I use a single name to reference each Start menu page</div></div><hr />
