<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinger95</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a need to display different license texts dependant upon user selection from a screen prior to the license screen.<br />
Basically user select Single, Multiple or Enterprise licensing and agrees to the matching eula. <br />
<br />
Problem is I can't seem to find a way that works. Here's what I've tried with NSIS 2.06:<br />
1. Method from 3license.zip from http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=136925<br />
2. Creating a custom page that looks like a license page. It doesn't display full license text or &quot;I Agree&quot; instead of next.<br />
3. Various attempts at conditionally choosing and !insertmacro line, MakeNSISW wouldn't accept any of the syntaxes tried.<br />
<br />
Is there currently any way to do this? I'd prefer not using GetDlgItem the way 1.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 04:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like the big problem here is the fact that the LicenseData command needed for the license text is a compile-time function.  (If it were a runtime function, you'd have it made.)  I think that your best option will be using GetDlgItem.<br />
<br />
Here's something else I found on the archive that might help:<br />

(you'd have to modify it slightly for what you're doing, but it still might work.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">3rd March 2006, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I just ran into this same need to conditionally show different licenses based on user selection. The function Comperio linked to seems like a nice solution, but I'm thinking WM_SETTEXT will not write in rich text. I was able to get around the problem by doing this:<br />
<br />
#in MUI defines/macro insertion area<br />
!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE ChooseLicenseA<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE &quot;license_a.rtf&quot;<br />
!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE ChooseLicenseB<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE &quot;license_b.rtf&quot;<br />
<br />
Function ChooseLicenseA<br />
#determine which eula to display<br />
#if it will be license_b<br />
 Abort<br />
#end if it will be license_b<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
Function ChooseLicenseB<br />
#determine which eula to display<br />
#if it was license_a<br />
 Abort<br />
#end if it was license_a<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I originally used ifdefs but decided it was less hassle to just call the same routine to determine the eula and just use the Abort instruction in both cases</div></div><hr />
