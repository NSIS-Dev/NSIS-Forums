<br />
Does anyone know how to get NSIS compiler version in compile time, on 2.0b3/4? I'd like to use it for conditional compiles, especially for working around 2.0b3 win95/me garbling bug. <br />
<br />
I've looked into documents, FAQs, forums, but I couldn't find any light shed on it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's better to distribute the latest version with your script. Making your script compatible with different versions isn't that easy and will take a lot of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was talking about the one marked #707476 (Japanese woes) on sourceforge.net.<br />
<br />
Anyways.. OK I see your point: Probably I release my software with latest stable version of NSIS.<br />
<br />
But I think such a feature is not so awful to have, especially for quick working around or something.<br />
<br />
(I was really trying to fix the bug using 2.0b4, but it won't allow MUI_FONTs anymore, and it isn't released yet. Additionally 2.0b3 contains some wierd language I fixed.. ;))<br />
<br />
I didn't meant something like dancing #ifdefs in sources of &quot;portable&quot; programs. I agree such a usage will be nightmare ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the hassle.</div></div><hr />
