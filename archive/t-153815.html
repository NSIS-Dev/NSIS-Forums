<br />
I need to know how to open a file, delete line a, all lines between line a, until line z and then delete line z. I already know how to write lines. I just need to know how to delete them.<br />
<br />
There is no telling what the line number is and it is surely unpredictable. I can not chase down line numbers. I need to chase down line markers.<br />
<br />
I need to tell the installer to look for...<br />
#BEGIN_0#<br />
Delete the above line, everything following it, until it reaches<br />
#END_0#<br />
And delete the above line too (#END_0#). <br />
<br />
Can someone write up a small and simple script detailing how best to acheive this effect?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your assistance and time on this. It is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

Just read the content except the lines you want to delete and then write it back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately I looked both on the forums and archives and believe I am only finding variations of what I am asking. I cannot find exactly what it is I am looking for :(<br />
<br />
If possible, can someone be kind enough to help out with this request? <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and assistance! It is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

More organization will be good...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm looking for basically this exact script, except it would delete from line A to line B, excluding lines A and B.  I've been staring at the code for a while and basically have no clue how to modify it to my needs.  I'm hoping someone more NSIS inclined could help me out  :) <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Yes, I'm an idiot.  I just found the code in the archive.  Thanks Afrow</div></div><hr />
