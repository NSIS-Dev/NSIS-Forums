<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lievencardoen</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Found strange bug (or I missed something) here. If I map a network path to a drive (let's say Z:\\, then I'm able to create a directory in Z:\\, I'm able to copy files to the root of Z:\\, I can create a file on Z:\\, but when I'm trying to copyfiles to a directory created in Z:\\, then copy fails...<br />
<br />
<br />
SharedEvaLocation:<br />
            IfFileExists $SharedEvaLocationPath\indiegroup\*.* next CreateIndieGroupFolder<br />
                CreateIndieGroupFolder:   <br />
                    DetailPrint &quot;IndieGroupFolderDoesNotExist --&gt; Creating directory $SharedEvaLocationPath\indiegroup&quot;<br />
                    CreateDirectory $SharedEvaLocationPath\indiegroup<br />
                    Goto next<br />
                next:<br />
                    IfFileExists $SharedEvaLocationPath\indiegroup\eva\applications\${APPLICATIONID}\*.* FinishCopyEvaFolderStructure AppNotRegistered<br />
                        AppNotRegistered:<br />
                            DetailPrint &quot;CopyFiles /SILENT $INSTDIR\indiegroup $SharedEvaLocationPath\indiegroup&quot;<br />
                            CopyFiles $INSTDIR\usermanagement\*.* &quot;$SharedEvaLocationPath&quot;<br />
                            Goto FinishCopyEvaFolderStructure<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Very strange and I can't seem to figure out why. Even more strange is that when I use the path to the networklocation (\\server\\...) instead of the mapped network drive, it does work... (really, it makes no sense at all but it's like that).<br />
<br />
Thx, Lieven Cardoen, Indie Group</div></div><hr />

Have you tried executing a script that just copies a very specific files to that path without any variables? Just CopyFiles &quot;C:\autoexec.bat&quot; &quot;Z:\&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy11252</div><div class="date">22nd January 2008, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also had a similair problem, being unable to create or copy files to the top level of a mapped drive. AllowRootDirInstall has been set true.<br />
<br />
It works fine if a UNC is specified, or if a drive letter is assigned to the mapped drive and that is used. It also works if I install to an existing sub-directory on the mapped drive.<br />
<br />
I've also tried using the plugin to convert a path to a UNC. However, this also doesn't work for the top level of a mapped drive. (but does for a sub-directory on the mapped drive).<br />
