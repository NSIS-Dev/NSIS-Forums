<br />
 What to add to the script :-<br />
BrandBitmap &quot;filename.bmp&quot;<br />
*********** Sets the branding bitmap.* This is necessary for this build else the default bitmap I used will be present... It MUST be a 16 color bitmap. The size MUST exactly be 90 x 245. <br />
<br />
ProgressBarColors [Progress Bar Foreground Color]* [Progress Bar Background Color]<br /><br />
** *<br />
**Specifies whether to use the default progress bar colors.* If you want to add different colors include this line. You have to include both the  Progress bar foreground color and Progress bar background color.* <br />
 <br />
It is recommended to add the Gradient and also the Install colors to match<br />
  the bitmap and progress bar colors to look really good.<br />

But, since you have a SF project, is it alright if I just put it on the Site with a redirect to your site???<br />

Just now noticed v1.60 ... it has colorable progress bar... Justin why not include a % field too in the middle of the progress bar to show the % of installation complete... Very useful for users with Smooth scrolling ... it takes ages to complete the install.. <br />
<br />
I was also thinking of setting an option to check if smooth scrolling was on and tweaking the registry to temporarily switch it off and then complete the install and switch it on..<br />

It seems the PM doesn't work, or I didn't get any message. E-mail me at : duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net to get more info. From there, I will put you on the site linking or whatever you want to do. <br />
