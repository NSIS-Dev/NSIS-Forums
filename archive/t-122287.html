<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wonko</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent the last day or so trying to figure out what's happening here, and I'm not having much luck. At first I experienced this problem with beta 0. I've since upgraded to the January 21st CVS nightly and the problem still exists.<br />
<br />
What's happening is this: In my main section, I start by searching for a specific config file on the user's system. If the file is found, I pop up a messagebox asking the user if this is the correct file. If the user clicks &quot;No&quot;, I call a function that displays an InstallOptions dialog with a label and a filerequest field.<br />
<br />
When the user clicks &quot;Next&quot; after filling in this field, I attempt to validate the data. First I check to see that the field is not empty. Then I check to see that the file exists. If either of these checks fail, a messagebox is displayed and we goto the top of the function again, re-displaying the dialog.<br />
<br />
The problem is that after the dialog is redisplayed, clicking &quot;Next&quot; just exits the installer. Kaboom. No errors, no nothing. It just disappears, no matter what the user types in the filerequest field. If the dialog *isn't* redisplayed (i.e., if the user entered a valid filename the first time) then everything works fine.<br />
<br />
I've completely run out of ideas for what could be causing this. Could it be a bug?<br />
<br />
The script in question is a little long to paste here, but I'd be happy to email it to anyone who thinks they can help. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

IO was designed to work as a custom page not from within a section or a callback function that is not the custom page callback function.<br />
<br />
You can use the MinLen field of IO to make sure the file path is there.<br />
<br />
BTW, you can always attach the script if it's too big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wonko</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like you're right. When I use a custom page creator function, it seems to work fine. It'll mean restructuring the logic flow a bit, but if it works, it's worth it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
