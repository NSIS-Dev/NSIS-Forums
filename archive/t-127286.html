It's working without any problems except the timeout feature. The version I have doesn't let you put a timeout attribute.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got a nsisdl w/ resume w/ timeout attribute ?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

A lot of code has changed in NSISdl since that version you are talking about. Nothing much in the downloading code though. You'll have to create your own, wait for someone else to create it or wait for resume support to be added to NSISdl which won't be anytime soon.</div></div><hr />
