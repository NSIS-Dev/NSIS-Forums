<br />
I am using the following command at compile time to help move files out of the way of a recursive spidering.<br />
<br />
!system '&quot;CMD/C|MOVE /Y &quot;C:\filepath\file.ext&quot; &quot;C:\bank\file.ext&quot;'<br />
<br />
This is great but unfortunately it's only for compile time. What is the run time equivalent command? I am having trouble getting it right.<br />
<br />
I've tried nsExec, Exec, ExecWait but I am convinced I must have the styling of the line wrong or something. This is quite easy to do with a .bat file but I am hoping there is a way to tell NSIS at uninstall to call a cmd, feed it a command and exit.<br />
<br />
I know this has to be possible but just don't know how, can someone help me out?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
