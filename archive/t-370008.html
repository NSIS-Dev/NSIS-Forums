(these files are often formed when downloading is often found not in the correct extension for video and image files)</div></div><hr />

But it NSIS has nothing to do with ... I wonder how this is implemented in NSIS ?</div></div><hr />

Supports basic media formats. I predict that in the years to come, it will be used by stass and two other guys. Couldn't sleep. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">1st September 2013, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not trust that kind of detection, for example; mp3 files might start with a ID3 or LAME tag or no header at all and you would have to look for mp3 frames/sync. Both Wav and AVI files are in a RIFF container and you need to parse that first, not just use a fixed offset...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aerDNA</div><div class="date">1st September 2013, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a simple approach and not 100% foolproof, I agree. But I tested against dozens of files and I think it's reliable enough for most practical purposes. I guess you didn't notice that in mp3 case several variations are checked for, including ID3 (LAME tag is never in the first 16B afaik, I tested Lame-encoded files w/wo ID3). In case of wav/avi, I initially considered checking for RIFF first but it would've been redundant as they in fact can be identified without exception by reading from a fixed offset (8; WAVEfmt/AVI LIST).</div></div><hr />
