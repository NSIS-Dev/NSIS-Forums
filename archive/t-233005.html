<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">l_d_allan</div><div class="date">12th December 2005, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;alert comment=&quot;web challenged&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
I've gotten a new computer, and want to be able to participate in the nsis forum on the new computer. Both computers are part of a SOHO workgroup with WinXp-Sp2.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to be able to logout from the old computer and be able to login from the new computer. I've attempted to logout from the old computer, remove cookies, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm able to login as l_d_allan on the new computer, but when I try to post a new message, I am identified as &quot;unregistered user&quot;<br />
<br />
When I logout from the old computer, the forum usually shows that l_d_allan is still logged in.<br />
<br />
I've rebooted from both computers, and tried a number of permutations .... but I'm stumped. Am I doing something wrong? Is this the way vBulletin works?<br />
<br />
My userid is l_d_allan .... I writing this from the old computer .... attempting to send a new topic is rejected from the new computer.<br />
<br />
&lt;/alert&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CraigF</div><div class="date">12th December 2005, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Just log in from both machines. the forums dont track sessions in that manor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">l_d_allan</div><div class="date">12th December 2005, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I've been unable to do .... on the new computer, there is a message &quot;Welcome back Lynn&quot; and I can view my profile, but I cannot initiate or reply to a topic. I was even able to go in and revise the password on the new computer, but I seem to be locked out of the forums.<br />
<br />
I'm writing this on the old computer .... when I try to reply on the new computer, the forum software identifies me as an unregistered user .... even after I was able to login?????<br />
<br />
This happens if if I am logged in on the old computer, or after I've logged off the old computer.<br />
<br />
Not a biggie .... just a nuisance ... I can create another user i.d. ..... it isn't like I'm all that prolific a contributor ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CraigF</div><div class="date">13th December 2005, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">do you have cookies disabled on the new computer? fairly sure its just your browser being funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ldajunk</div><div class="date">19th December 2005, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that seemed to be the problem. I've got the computer set to &quot;challenge&quot; a cookie being delivered from a webpage. Most websites that use cookies cause this challenge to appear, but that doesn't seem to be the case for nsis forums.  <br />
<br />
I put this security setting back to &quot;automatic&quot; and I seem to be able to initiate topic threads, and reply to existing ones.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and patience.</div></div><hr />
