I'd like to use another format there but can't figure out how.  Is it even possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">24th October 2005, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of format do you want to use?<br />
Here (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/versioninformation/versioninformationreference/versioninformationstructures/vs_fixedfileinfo.asp)  is the description of the format in which file info is stored on Windows.<br />
Pay special attention to dwFileVersionMS, dwFileVersionLS, dwProductVersionMS and dwProductVersionLS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ffletch2</div><div class="date">24th October 2005, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hoping to do something like 1.2 Beta for the file version.  What I'm really trying to do here is differentiate between a Beta and Released version.  I would like to be able to have the user right click on the installer and be able to figure it if it is a beta or a release build.  Likewise elsewhere in my install, I'd like to be able to do stuff based on beta or release.  I was hoping to do this based on information already in our .exe using this example: this example (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209154&amp;highlight=GetDLLVersion).  I can have my developer(s) put whatever I want in any of the file info fields.  Right now they have 1.2 Beta.  I was thinking I could ask for one of the fields to say beta or release.  But I can't see a way to query any of the other fields.  Is it possible to query any of those other fields?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">24th October 2005, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">As you see from the VS_FIXEDFILEINFO structure, it only accepts DWORD values for the version information.<br />
What you could perhaps do is either modify the code so that you can set the dwFileFlags field to have the VS_FF_PRERELEASE flag or you can us VIAddVersionKey to add a key with the prerelease information.</div></div><hr />
