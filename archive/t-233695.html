<br />
Some time ago I created a plugin (IEFunctions, it's in the repository). Today I was looking at it again and I seem to be missing some files to be able to build it again (namely the files in NSISDIR\Contrib\ExDll)<br />
<br />
Now it's been some time since I worked on this, but looking around I'm guessing they're part of the nsis-source, which aren't distributed in the installer anymore, so I guess I'll need to download the sources from sourceforge.<br />
<br />
Still, I wonder how I ever succeeded in creating a plugin, since I can't seem to find any documentation about how to go about it. Can anyone tell me where I can find that information?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

You just  need to read up in ExDll.c (which as you rightly said is only found in the source package).<br />
It's a piece of cake really (unless you have no programming experience of course!)<br />
