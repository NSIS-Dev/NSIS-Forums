<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdsama</div><div class="date">30th December 2008, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first time using NSIS to put together an installer so all due apologies if I'm missing something obvious.<br />
<br />
I'm creating an installer to replace a large number of legacy installers and need to represent the various dependencies and incompatibilities in the section selection page of the installer. To this end I've been using a slightly tweaked version of the mutual exclusion code I found on the wiki http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Mutually_Exclusive_Sections. (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Mutually_Exclusive_Sections)<br />
<br />
My problem arises as one of the mutual exclusive pairs lies within a selection tree the root of which has some required installation code (which I represented as a hidden section). An unintended result of this is that it becomes impossible to deselect the root.<br />
<br />
Checkboxes change, when clicked, from partially selected to fully selected and from fully selected to unselected. This poses a problem because a selection tree with mutually exclusive sections will never be fully selected and a section group with a hidden section will never become unselected by deselection of its children sections. Thus it gets stuck on partially selected.<br />
<br />
Intuitively, I'd expect some way to retrieve which section was clicked like with the onmouseover function, perhaps with an onClick function or something similar which I could use to manually set the response to a click i.e. partial-&gt;unselected. I can't seem to find anything helpful, however, that doesn't require making a custom installer page, which I'd rather not do if it is avoidable.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help or advice you can offer.</div></div><hr />
