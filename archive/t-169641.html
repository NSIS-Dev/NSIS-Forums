<br />
I wanted to know if someone could point me to an example of linked edit text boxes.  The idea is to have 4 edit boxes where the user enters 6 characters/numbers in each box.  I can get this to work, but a feature that's unsupported by Wise and InstallShield (AFAIK) is autoadvance and autobackspace between fields.  (I explain by example:)<br />
<br />
Serial Number:   888EDI-328FED-2389AS-89FEJI<br />
<br />
     |_____| - |_____| - |_____| - |_____| <br />
<br />
we want four edit boxes where the user can type continually and it'll auto-tab from field to field... this is easy enough to implement in other systems, but I'm trying to discern if NSIS can easily handle backspacing across multiple fields.  (i.e. user types in full serial and notices a typo in field #2...  hits backspace to delete back through field #4 and #3 to get to field #2)<br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm relatively new to NSIS and a clear solution isn't jumping out at me...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

but the auto-tab function is still not very easy.<br />
could someone help me how to get the name/id/handle or something else to identify the component calling the notify-event?<br />
maybe getting the current selected component at the leave-function (called by notify).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will have to modify InstallOptions.</div></div><hr />
