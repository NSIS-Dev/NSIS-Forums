<br />
Much Appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ijerkovi</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">It is the &quot;X&quot; button in the top left hand corner of the installer. This button is the standard &quot;close&quot; button of any windows application. Let me know if this is sufficient or you would still require the screen shot. Much Appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a button in the installer to close the Install window after the &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button. That button is disabled? If not, click it. Now the installer closes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ijerkovi</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking about the &quot;x&quot; button and not the &quot;close&quot; or &quot;cancel&quot; buttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Please, try it and say. You don't want to I try to fix the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">So you have created an installer an the X button does not work? That's weird, you are probably using an outdated NSIS version. Get the lastest version at http://nsis.sf.net.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ijerkovi</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry maybe I was not clear enough. It seems when my installer is running (copying files) pressing the &quot;X&quot; (aka exit/close button) does nothing it does not stop the installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right. It's disabled because stopping during the installation is not a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ijerkovi</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">In other words this is by design. Right? If yes, then this answers my question. Much appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">That is not a fault with NSIS, and is built in by design.<br />
Why would you want the user to be able to close the installer while files are being installed - on major installers, it would leave half the software installed, and half the dlls registered or whatever.<br />
<br />
But anyway, maybe there should be a NSIS command to enable the close button (along with a warning message).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ijerkovi</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the &quot;X&quot; button should at least look disabled? Right now clicking is allowed and a normal user expectation would be to have some reaction to a click to an enabled exit button. Perhaps a wish list for next release?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">19th August 2003, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The X button have the same effect as the Close or Cancel button, it's because of that questions before if you didn't understand. Sometimes the Close button is disabled, so the X button have to be too but appears not disabled, but when you click it, it is as disabled.</div></div><hr />
