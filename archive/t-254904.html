<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wabiloo</div><div class="date">5th September 2006, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
A friend of mine wrote a plugin to allow me to encode and encrypt passwords.<br />
<br />
The idea is that I need to MD5 hash a password and then convert it to hexadecimal or Base64 for storage in an XML file.<br />
This plugin works great when I execute the installer on my own computer. However, on other (newly installed) computers, it just doesn't and returns the un-encrypted password.<br />
<br />
For the following code:<br />
<br />
Encoder::ToBase64 &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
Pop $1<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Base64 encode: $\&quot;$1$\&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Encoder::FromBase64 $1<br />
Pop $2<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Base64 decode: $\&quot;$2$\&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Encoder::ToHex &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
Pop $3<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Hex encode: $\&quot;$3$\&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Encoder::FromHex $3<br />
Pop $4<br />
DetailPrint &quot;Hex decode: $\&quot;$4$\&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Encoder::MD5Hash &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
Pop $5<br />
DetailPrint &quot;MD5: $\&quot;$5$\&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The expected output is:<br />
<br />
Base64 encode: &quot;SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ==&quot;<br />
Base64 decode: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
Hex encode: &quot;48656c6c6f2c20776f726c6421&quot;<br />
Hex decode: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
MD5: &quot;lÃ“UmÃ« Â¥KÃŠ L9GËœ9&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
but instead I get:<br />
<br />
C:\DOCUME~1\TestUser\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsq2F.tmp\Encoder.dll<br />
C:\DOCUME~1\TestUser\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsq2F.tmp\Encoder.dll<br />
C:\DOCUME~1\TestUser\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsq2F.tmp\Encoder.dll<br />
Base64 encode: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
C:\DOCUME~1\TestUser\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsq2F.tmp\Encoder.dll<br />
Base64 decode: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
C:\DOCUME~1\TestUser\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsq2F.tmp\Encoder.dll<br />
Hex encode: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
C:\DOCUME~1\TestUser\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsq2F.tmp\Encoder.dll<br />
Hex decode: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
C:\DOCUME~1\TestUser\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsq2F.tmp\Encoder.dll<br />
MD5: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So clearly something doesn't quite work. Already, I can't quite figure out why I get so many paths repeated over and over again<br />
Unfortunately, my friend is not available anymore to help and I'm not versed into the dark arts of C++ and plugin writing.<br />
<br />
I would be eternally grateful if someone could have a look at it and see what's going wrong. <br />
As soon as something is stable and working, I'll add it to the Wiki.<br />
<br />
I attach the sources and compiled plugin.<br />
(BTW, my friend commented that &quot;the included exdll.h is not the same on from the Nullsoft SDK, it has a couple of my own signatures in so make sure you reference the right<br />
one if you do a build!&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">6th September 2006, 01:59</div></div><div class="posttext">From a quick look, this line in exdll:<br />
#define NSISPlugin(name)	void __declspec(dllexport)<br />
should be:<br />
#define NSISPlugin(name)	extern &quot;C&quot; void __declspec(dllexport)because the source is a .cpp file. It appears it dosen't make a difference to the plugin at the moment. I will spend the next hour or so looking though the code for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">6th September 2006, 03:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The base64 routines would not compile on my machine, so I commented out the references to it to compile it. <br />
<br />
I have attached a test NSIS .exe showing the hex and MD5 conversion. The next step is to find a base 64 converter on the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">6th September 2006, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I though I might as well add the modified code that made the example above possible.<br />
<br />
Note: make that change to exdll that I noted above.</div></div><hr />
