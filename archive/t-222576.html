<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ilya31</div><div class="date">26th July 2005, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to create an .exe using NSIS that can run as windows service? What do I need to include in order to create application that will run as windows service? <br />
I have searched the forum and I found some help about how to install a new service using NSIS, but it does not mention how to create Windows service executable. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have used nsSCM.dll plug in to install and start a service (GetFileVersion.exe- which is just an executable, that I created using NSIS that removes some files from user hard drive). The service that I create appears in the Windows Services window but when I try to start it I get the following error: &quot;Could not start the Version Service (service that I created using NSIS) on Local Computer.<br />
Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.&quot;   <br />
<br />
Any help would be great.</div></div><hr />

I have found several ways to do that. One was is to create a windows service that always executes my program using nsSCM.dll plug in, but I had some issues with it. <br />
<br />
I found an easier way so I don't need to mess with windows services, which can create a lot of troubles. All you need to do is add an entry to<br />
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry and your program will execute everytime computer starts. It is pretty cool and you don't need to use extra plugins. <br />
<br />
See the following msdn website for more info about this registry. <br />
