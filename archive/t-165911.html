<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trankyfunky</div><div class="date">21st January 2004, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I know... there are about 1 million posts about this.<br />
But I still can't see the light.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm working on a script that installs some files depending on the OS version; since I need this script to be run on every OS (excluding WfW), I do the OS detection with .OnGuiInit (Using MUI - so I use MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_GUIINIT).<br />
I've organized the three collection of files in three sections, one for (and only) each OS.<br />
<br />
The problem is that, after some tests with &quot;one-section.nsi&quot; and &quot;Sections.nsh&quot;, I can't get the list of the sections as read-only and the only section i need as selected.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.  :D <br />
<br />
P.S.: maybe someone could write a full, in-depth &quot;HOWTO&quot; for advanced working and/or tricking with Sections...:confused:</div></div><hr />

I think the same thing, I know all the NSIS codes except the Sections ones (doing basic things is all right, but with several switches is difficult), and I'm here more than 2 years. But I never used it for my installers (Yes, NEVER)...</div></div><hr />
