most of your questions are answered there in a fast and understandable way.</div></div><hr />

I not sleepy but I almost feel asleep 3 times looking this UI readme (I guess it's just me :-)<br />
<br />
Anyway - kichik (unlike you) gave me some super fast useful answers<br />
<br />
I love U man ! (not U :-)</div></div><hr />

ok, then you've got a problem :)<br />
even me has to look back to the docs often, because i forget the right syntax or spelling sometimes.<br />
so, can you imagine how the forums would look like, if i'd post here everytime? :)<br />
<br />
it was ment as a hint for you, to have a look at the readme, it may save YOUR (and our) time to look there, instead of the internet :)</div></div><hr />

1. Forums R made 4 searching... the more data =&gt; the better forum...<br />
(Maybe there should B some improvment on forums search...)<br />
<br />
2. If room on the server is the problem then I agree with you and I would delete this message (if I only could)<br />
but I don't think it's the case...<br />
<br />
It's not my fault that U wrote a shitty HTML UI readme file instead of CHM searchable help file...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yovav</div><div class="date">13th September 2004, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I found out the readme file is not that bad,<br />
it seemed bad when IE failed finding text strings in it...<br />
<br />
Anyway, it can be not so clear if you want to know what is the new name of some MUI that does not exist anymore...<br />
<br />
May god bless NSIS, it's makers and me.</div></div><hr />
