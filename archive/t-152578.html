<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcsston</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Can NSIS create a zip compatible installer? A exe that can be opened by WinZip/WinRar as a SFX zip?<br />
I was told there was a plugin that allows it but have had no luck finding one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">No, NSIS does not use the ZIP file format.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcsston</div><div class="date">15th October 2003, 07:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't NSIS use zlib for compression?<br />
If it does, all that would be needed would be a zip header at the start of the compressed data and a footer at the end of the exe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th October 2003, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS uses zlib or bzip2. But I think Justin has optimized zlib, and made it incompatible during the process. I would have to check this out to make sure.<br />
<br />
But even if it will be done, it won't be done before NSIS 2 and would only be done if a flag has been set in the script. You should add a feature request at the SF project page for now.<br />
<br />
There is no such plug-in that does this. Plug-ins are currently runtime only. This change would have to be made in the compiler.<br />
<br />
This feature, if implemented, would cause a lot of internal changes to makensis, which raises the question - why? NSIS builds installers, not SFX.</div></div><hr />
