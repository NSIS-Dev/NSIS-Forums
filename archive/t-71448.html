7z Format<br />
7z is the new archive format, providing high compression ratio.<br />
<br />
The main features of 7z format:<br />
<br />
Open architecture. <br />
Ability of using any compression or conversion method. <br />
Supporting files with sizes up to 16000000000 GB. <br />
Unicode file names. <br />
Solid compressing. <br />
Archive headers compressing. <br />
7z has open architecture, so it can support any new compression methods.<br />
<br />
Now the following methods are integrated to 7z:<br />
MethodID Description <br />
LZMA It's based on Lempel-Ziv algorithm. <br />
PPMD Dmitry Shkarin's PPMdH with small changes. <br />
BCJ2 (CALL, JUMP, JCC) converter for 32-bit x86 executables. <br />
BZip2 BWT algorithm. <br />
Deflate Lempel-Ziv and Huffman. <br />
<br />
<br />
Current version of 7z format is beta, so it is possible that format will be changed in future.</div></div><hr />

I downloaded it, and did a few quick and dirty tests with it, compared to winzip 8.1. At first the tests didn't look so good. I zipped up 14 mp3's. Winzip won by a few bytes. And then I went to .exe files, and winzip won again. Then tried a few folders with graphics, and html files. 7-zip won by 13 kb.</div></div><hr />

Well, gee, what a surprise.  Trying to compress mp3's (already compressed sound) won't work to well.  Taking non-compressed files (pictures and web pages) will work fine.  So in short words, your test sucks.</div></div><hr />

BZip2 BWT algorithm.<br />
<br />
Well if it emulates BZip2 it would be nice to see if it is good. Code a version your self and see if it will work.<br />

<br />
7-Zip is LGPL'd, so it's compatible with NSIS I think...</div></div><hr />
