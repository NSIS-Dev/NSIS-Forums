<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">6th June 2006, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">IDEA? : See if we can make a webform script where we just tick the antivirus solution provider of a list of most common ones, we type the version press send and the antivirus provider gets a default letter per email and and entry in their forum of false positives. <br />
<br />
I get sick of the crappy software with false positives giving NSIS a bad name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">7th June 2006, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I contacted AVG technical support and got the following answer:<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
I am sorry but it looks like you mean false alarm that was already corrected in update released yesterday when we had some reports about it. Could you please verify this with up to date Avg? I downloaded one installer from web site you mentioned and nothing was detected. If there would be still problem then please send me direct link for file on which problem occurs. We will analyse it and remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />

Don't take it as only joke. The wiki really needs a page to what contains information about the false positives.</div></div><hr />
