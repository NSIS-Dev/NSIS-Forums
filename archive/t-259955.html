<br />
i'm totally new to NSIS, and i'm still experimenting with the examples and tutorials found in the NSIS installation directory.<br />
<br />
i was surprised to see that the Library.nsi example doesn't work. returns with a &quot;Error opening file for writing: c:\...bla bla\Library Test\test.dll &quot;<br />
<br />
again the code is in C:\program files\nsis\Examples\ and the file called Library.nsi<br />
<br />
!define TestDLL '&quot;${NSISDIR}\Plugins\LangDLL.dll&quot;'<br />
<br />
!insertmacro InstallLib DLL       NOTSHARED REBOOT_PROTECTED      ${TestDLL} $INSTDIR\test.dll $INSTDIR<br />
<br />
thanx guys for you help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi Red Wine,<br />
Thanx for the reply, but i didn't quite get wat ur trying to say???? this code came with the nsis installation in the example directory and shouldn't be buggy... ??? <br />
again the code in questions is in C:\program files\nsis\Examples\Library.nsi<br />
my problem is that i wish to install dll files from a certain application and the only example i have to help me, doesn't work... <br />
<br />
cheers,<br />
Simon</div></div><hr />

excellent ... i'm following you so far... <br />
it was concentrating more on the syntax part of it... so now, i have a bunch of dll files that need to be installed on a system. previously, without an installer, i simply used to just copy the dlls into the $INSTDIR... but now that i know about NSIS (tryin to get to know about it atleast) how would i go on installing them? i can see that there are many types (dll, regdll, tlb, and regdlltlb) also if shared and install method ( reboot_protected... bla bla)<br />
<br />
the question is how do i know which to use with my dlls??<br />
<br />
Thank you guys for your patience... i really have spent 2 days googling about it.. and the NSIS User Manual says nearly nothin about it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i came to that conclusion yesterday, logically since previously i was copying and pasting the files with new installations, it makes perfect sense to use the File instruction. what a waste of 2 days!!!...<br />
The manual was really vague about it, and i thought might as well do it the proper way...<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your help... i will be using the file instruction :)</div></div><hr />
