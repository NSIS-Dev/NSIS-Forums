<br />
I have an installer that extracts files during the installer, and while the plugin (nsisunz) is extracting, the cancel button is grayed out.<br />
<br />
How do I enable this button, because if not possible, my users will be unable to cancel the installation until the installation is complete.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I am not sure nsisunz is doing this (disabling the cancel button) since I just put a &quot;sleep 5000&quot; after the extraction and the cancel button remains disabled.</div></div><hr />

If so then enabling it won't do anything anyway. You'd need to modify nsisunz to use an asynchronous thread and include a cancel flag.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">empezar</div><div class="date">31st July 2007, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">well shouldn't the cancel button become available when nsisunz isn't doing anything (e.g. during a sleep)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aidengrandfield</div><div class="date">20th May 2009, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I wrote an installer for the company I work for which addresses the cancel problem using a modified version of NSISUNZ which keeps checking the stack for a cancel flag flag.<br />
<br />
I have organized each section of an installer to have an extract (which enables the cancel button), finish (critical section, not cancellation) and remove, which also allows for roll back during the install.<br />
<br />
We will most likely be releasing this source once the quality is high enough. I just want to put this out there to gauge the level on interest.</div></div><hr />
