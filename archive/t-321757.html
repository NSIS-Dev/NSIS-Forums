<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeFrog1</div><div class="date">17th August 2010, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I have NSIS/Unicode script that installs my application.<br />
The installation requires admin privileges, which I get by setting up the privilege level<br />
At the end of the installation, I want to launch my application.<br />
<br />
My problem is that the application launches in Admin mode.<br />
I'd like to launch it in user mode, just as if a user double clicked its icon.<br />
<br />
Nothing I tried worked. Even setting down the level before launching wouldn't help.<br />
<br />
What can I do?</div></div><hr />

The easy solution: Disable the run checkbox on the finish page<br />
The hard solution: Use the UAC plugin</div></div><hr />

<br />
There must be some way to reduce a process' privileges. This page http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511445.aspx#elevationgl says &quot;Once a task that requires administrative privileges is complete, the program should revert to the least privilege state.&quot; That phrase is used several times on the page.<br />
<br />
I have not yet found where they tell how to revert to lower privileges.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">18th August 2010, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the reverse even true?  I.e. can a process elevate itself mid-run?  I was under the impression that it can't; that, at best, you can start a new process with the appropriate privileges.<br />
<br />
There's some discussions out there on how to run an app as user from a higher elevation... one using the Task Scheduler ( http://www.codeproject.com/KB/vista-security/VistaElevator.aspx ), one doing crazy things by getting the desktop (which it presumes to be non-elevated) and spawning a new process using that desktop's security tokens ( http://blogs.msdn.com/b/aaron_margosis/archive/2009/06/06/faq-how-do-i-start-a-program-as-the-desktop-user-from-an-elevated-app.aspx &lt;- http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2009/07/09/launch-a-process-as-standard-user-from-an-elevated-process.aspx ) and another that looks entirely like hieroglyphics after gazing at it for 2 minutes ( http://brandonlive.com/2008/04/27/getting-the-shell-to-run-an-application-for-you-part-2-how/ ).<br />
<br />
But they're all about starting new processes - in which case, the UAC plugin should work quite well within the NSIS context and would be more flexible.</div></div><hr />
