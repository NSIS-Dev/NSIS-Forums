<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeMcC00L</div><div class="date">18th April 2006, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Good afternoon,<br />
<br />
I am writing an installer that needs to call an InstallShield self-extractor using ExecWait. I am currently running it silently using the following syntax:<br />
<br />
<br />
${If} $VAR1 == &quot;1&quot;<br />
ExecWait '&quot;path\to\selfextractor.exe&quot; /s /a /s /sms /f1$EXEDIR\path\to\issfile.iss' $0<br />
<br />
<br />
I used the instructions at http://unattended.sourceforge.net/installers.php to find the command-line parameters. For some reason, the &quot;selfextractor.exe&quot; seems to hang in the background (taskman-&gt;processes tab) indefinately, until I end my installer from the task manager. Then the selfextractor executes and installes the third-party product just fine.<br />
<br />
Have any of you come across this problem? It seems to happen only with this particular EXE, as the others I include in the installer work just fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Joe</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran it from the command line like you said, and seemed to ignore both the /H and the /? parameter. I also failed to mention in my previous post that I tested the command as you see it on a virtual machine, just from the command line, and it works fine.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeMcC00L</div><div class="date">19th April 2006, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the redirect, but this doesn't help me. This gentleman's problem occurred during a silent installation of the NSIS installer, but the normal mode worked fine. I cannot even get the normal mode to work.<br />
<br />
I removed the first /s command to confirm that the installation is indeed extracting to the $TEMP directory, which it is, and it appears that the Setup.exe that's extracted does not run until my installer is closed. I hope this helps clarify my problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeMcC00L</div><div class="date">19th April 2006, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Update: the problem still exists when I just use Exec instead of ExecWait. The window shows that the self-extractor is extracting, just like before, and while that is happening the next command in my script is being executed. I run the rest of my NSIS installer normally, and my unattended IS exe only runs after the NSIS installer is closed. Perhaps this behavior is a hard-coded into the IS installer by the third-party company who makes it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">19th April 2006, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be, in which case you could call a function in NSIS which puts itself into a loop while your installer.exe is running. You can use the FindProcDLL  (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FindProcDLL_plug-in) plugin for that.<br />
<br />
Like so:<br />
Push setup.exe<br />
Call WaitForInstaller<br />
<br />
<br />
Function WaitForInstaller<br />
Exch $R1<br />
Push $R0<br />
Loop:<br />
 Sleep 1000<br />
 FindProcDll::FindProc $R1<br />
StrCmp $R0 1 Loop<br />
Pop $R0<br />
Pop $R1<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Would be an idea to make the installer file name unique, in case the user already has a setup.exe process.<br />
