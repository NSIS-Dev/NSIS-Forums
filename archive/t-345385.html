<br />
I'm using NSIS 2.46 with Modern UI and have come across a situation which I am unable to solve. Searching doesn't seem to produce any helpful results so I thought I would ask here. I want to present a particular licence agreement based on a choice which the user makes. So for example if they select that they are based in Europe one licence agreement shows, however if they select North America another agreement shows. However I am a bit stumped about how to do this - can anyone help me out?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
<br />

*Use two pages and skip one of them by calling abort in the pre callback for the page<br />
*Load the license at runtime ( http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?p=2318823#post2318823 http://nsis.sourceforge.net/CustomLicense_plug-in <br />
