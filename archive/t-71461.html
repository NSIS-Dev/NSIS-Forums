<br />
I've a very short question for u. Could you please tell me how to delete files in subdiretories. I have something like,<br />
<br />
\dir1\dir2\files ...<br />
\dir1\dir3\files ...<br />
\dir1\dir4\files ...<br />
<br />
If i try Delete /r $INSDIR\dir1<br />
<br />
Will it work (and remove files in dir1 also?)<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SQwerl</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">No, Delete does not remove Directories. You would need to do something like this<br />
<br />
# use *.* to delete all files in one dir, <br />
# or you could delete each file <br />
# individually, but why?<br />
<br />
Delete &quot;$INSTDIR\myAPP\*.*&quot; <br />
<br />
# This will delete all dir's, that are in <br />
# the install dir.<br />
<br />
 RMDir /r &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
btw, I am not sure if the enclosing Quotes are needed around $INSTDIR, if anyone knows for sure, i'd appreciate some feedback. I would think they are needed, if the Dir contains spaces, such as c:\program files\myAPP</div></div><hr />

No, Delete does not remove Directories. You would need to do something like this<br />
[B]Delete &quot;$INSTDIR\myAPP\*.*&quot; <br />
<br />
# This will delete all dir's, that are in <br />
# the install dir.<br />
<br />
<br />
When using this<br />
<br />
DELETE &quot;$INSTDIR\conf\*.*&quot;<br />
this will deletre all files in that directory but not the subdirectories !!!!<br />
Hence If I have a directory called $INSTDIR\conf\xml\<br />
Xml directory is not deleted and the files in this directory neither !!<br />
<br />
So my questions is how to Clear a directory and its sub-direcotries (There are too much directories to clear them by hand)<br />
<br />
File /r works for copy ....</div></div><hr />
