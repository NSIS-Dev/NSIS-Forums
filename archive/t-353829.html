<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jamjamjam</div><div class="date">27th December 2012, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to go over all of the files that are located in a section by using the section ID?<br />
<br />
I want to create a function that receives a list of section names and for each file in each section accordingly to its extension I will decide to register it in a specific place in the registry.<br />
<br />
Is it possibly?</div></div><hr />

Because NSIS interprets its script line-for-line, there's no way for NSIS to know which files have been / will be installed and which have not / will not. You will have to maintain your own list of files, and use that.<br />
<br />
But... Why don't you just register a file the moment you install it? That way you don't have to worry about keeping logs / lists.</div></div><hr />
