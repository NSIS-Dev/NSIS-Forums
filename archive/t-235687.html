<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marcp</div><div class="date">17th January 2006, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on an application installer that needs to install itself in a database. <br />
<br />
AT a certain stage I would like to feed data from the database into a drop down to let the user make a selection for the next step.<br />
<br />
What is the general way to do that. Let a query run and write entries for dropdown in file and then read that to set combo entries or is there a better way to do this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's how I do it.<br />
Alternatively you can write a plugin which can do the database query for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently I have enough troubles glueing everything together, so I leave the plugin part to an experienced user :)<br />
<br />
Till now I end up with two new problems after solving one. But  I look at it the bright side it keeps me busy (lol) :D :D</div></div><hr />
