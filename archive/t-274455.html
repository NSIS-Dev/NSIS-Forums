<br />
Could anyone tell me if administrative rights are needed at the local computer where the installer prepared using NSIS is run. Basically the NSIS installer I am creating would be distributed to some companies. So I want to know if the computers where these installers are run would need to have administrative rights for it to install the application.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />

When a restricted user runs an installer which must modify files/folders/registry entries where admin rights are requiered, obviously the installation would fail.</div></div><hr />
