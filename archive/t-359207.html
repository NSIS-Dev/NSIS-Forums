<br />
I'm stuck. If I do:<br />
nsDialogs::Create 1018<br />
${NSD_CreateLink}  180u 132u 50% 13u &quot;End User License Agreement&quot;<br />
Pop $Link<br />
${NSD_OnClick} $Link LinkClick<br />
The link works as it should, I get a hover hand, and the function &quot;LinkClick&quot; is executed. However, if I change the dialogID to 1044 then the I do not get a hover hand and LinkClick is not executed.<br />
<br />
Why is this, and how can I fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm tryig to create a full screen UI. I do have a finish page and welcome page.<br />
<br />
I think that you are on to something as we've made progress here. If I add Call muiPageLoadFullWindow before my code and Call muiPageUnloadFullWindow after AND move my link to the top of the page by setting the Y coordinate of the link to 0u then the link works. Then if I move it back down the page where it belongs it stops working. Seems like a Z order thing for sure. Any other thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Nothing else should be covering up your link unless you have other controls in your custom page. If you have a machine with Visual Studio installed you can inspect the windows using Spy++ (use the search tool).<br />

Thanks for your help Stu, Spy++ was a great idea. After running it I was able to see that other transparent controls were over my links and that is why they were not working. I suppose the reason that they worked on 1018 dialogs is because I had to rearrange them in order to see them since they are lower down on the 1044 dialog. When I moved the links up in the Y direction to test they were no longer buried under the offending transparent controls.<br />
<br />
The solution for me was to rearrange the order that I create controls so that the links are created first and the other controls created later. This caused the expected behavior.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
