<br />
Matrix(a, b) = (c = 0; #[l(a) &gt;= l(b), d = l(a) - 1, d = l(b) - 1]; #{c++ &lt;= d, x[c] = (a[c] + b[c])})<br />
<br />
(I'm trying to do more codes for Math Plugin to do basic calculators calculations like Permutation (nPr) or some others I found useful, like a code to round the number automatically, just putting what digit after dot to round and the number to round)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brainsucker</div><div class="date">22nd November 2003, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Matrix(a,b) (c=-1; x={}; d=#[l(a)&gt;l(b), l(a), l(b)]; #{c++&lt;d, x[c]=a[c]+b[c]}; x)<br />
<br />
tips: <br />
1. no = needed between Matrix() and ().<br />
2. x array should be declared before use.<br />
3. if you'd like x to be the function output, place it as last expression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree it would be a good idea to create sub-forums for all sorts of subjects, but there doesn't seem to be a need currently. There is not so much in here anyway... Thinking about it again, I don't know why we decided to create a sub forum for languages and not keep it here as it has even less discussion than plug-ins.<br />
<br />
Oh, almost forgot... Yay for the calculator plug-in :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also good that these topics are easy to find, because language questions can only be answered by the translators, so it will usually take longer.</div></div><hr />
