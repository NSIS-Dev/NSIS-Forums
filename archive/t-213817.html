<br />
I have noticed this come up a couple of times in the forums but never saw an actual solution.  Does anybody know a way to make the NSIS require the user to scroll the dialog before being allowed to continue with the the installation.  I saw one post from one of the dev's that said this was a feature to be included later, the post I believe was from 2003, so I was wondering if this has been implemented and how to use this feature(Doesn't appear to be listed in the docs).<br />
<br />
Any help that any one can provide would be greately appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
