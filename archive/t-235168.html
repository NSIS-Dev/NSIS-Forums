<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krisiacik</div><div class="date">10th January 2006, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi..<br />
I want to achieve a completely silent installation of current ATi Catalyst Drivers.<br />
It is a &quot;package for the web&quot; .That means it is a directory and file structure packageged into one exe file. That structure has its own separate setup exe.<br />
That catalyst package is made in NSIS.<br />
Now.<br />
There is a /S switch for that package made in NSIS..that's ok.<br />
There is a /k switch for that setup.exe inside the packaded structure.<br />
<br />
So it is an instaler inside an instaler.<br />
<br />
Both switches work ok. The problem is it is not possible to launch it so that both of them would run silently in one command. That's the point.In one command.<br />
<br />
In installshield type &quot;package for the web&quot;, there is a possibility to pass on switches to the included setup.exe <br />
What I want to achieve si something like that.<br />
In start/run ...there would be<br />
<br />
&quot;c:\DRIVERS\ati-driver-very-complicated-name.exe&quot; /S /X /k<br />
<br />
The first is OK..<br />
<br />
the /k is for the setup.exe inside the package..<br />
<br />
/X is what I need... a switch that tells to pass on any following switches to the second setup.<br />
<br />
I hope, I vas very clear and explicit about what I want to achieve..Please, don't advise me some third party decompresion tools, or some manual action in between.<br />
I need a single command.<br />
Only when somebody will tell me that NSIS isn't capable of this, I will consider another methods.<br />
Thank you in advance :) <br />

You cannot pass parameters from the main NSIS installer to the InstallShield installer packaged inside because the parameters passed are hard-coded into the NSIS installer (with an Exec instruction no doubt).<br />
