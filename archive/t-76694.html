<br />
I've tried a couple of GUI's and this one worked right out of the box.<br />
Others I've tried were bugging me with runtime error and other strange<br />
bugs.<br />
<br />
Q: When you use the wizard to create a new project, it uses the old method for Uninstall. <br />
UninstallExeName &quot;Uninst.exe&quot; instead of  WriteUninstaller &quot;uninst.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there a way to change the wizards behavior for this?<br />
Second, is there a 'smart' way to change / add new functions into the functions field so it's up to date with the latest version of NSIS?<br />
<br />
Would be nice with an version variable that reflects which version of NSIS functions that are supported.<br />
<br />
I hope I made some sence, my english is a bit rusty.<br />

<br />
since this link http://www.techmarc.ndirect.co.uk/fnsetup.exe does not work anymore, I think Marc doesn't develop NSIS Workbench anymore unfortunately. I already ask him to update the program for NSIS 1.96 commands and instructions. He would try to make free some time to invest in NSIS Workbench. I think we should conclude he hasn't found time.<br />
<br />
Maybe he will supply the source code at the forum, so that one of us can keep developing NSIS Workbench. I agree that this is a great GUI, also because of integrated help for NSIS commands and compilation.<br />

<br />
Regarding the link, change it to: http://www.techmarc.co.uk/fnsetup.exe <br />
<br />
Edit WebUpdate.ini and remove ndirect from the url.<br />
<br />
Seems that he moved to Techmarc's official website.<br />

<br />
Indeed, the site moved, but I do not get a response to my e-mail, so I assume support stopped.<br />
