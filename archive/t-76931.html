<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jonallen</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Just want to pass on my thanks and words of encouragement to anyone who helps develop NSIS.<br />
<br />
I had to develop an installer for an internal app used in my dept. @ work.  I finally settled on a wham-bam-gui kind of installer program (InstallAnywhere).  After several hours of fits and starts I got the thing to work.  It wrapped a jre around the thing and bloated out to 8 or 9 mb.  Yuck!<br />
<br />
So, my machine went to toast and I had to recreate the install from scratch.  Lo and behold, NSIS to the rescue!  In less than an hour I created an install that worked great across all required platforms and was only 1.5 mb!  Yay!  The scripting method kicks ass, the examples were great, and the docs complete. What a great tool.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I am not one of the developers, but I know what you mean. What you could do is spread the word on NSIS and (if you want to) develop for NSIS. NSIS is a community effort and it would be nice to see some new developers give something to NSIS. Welcome to the community.<br />
