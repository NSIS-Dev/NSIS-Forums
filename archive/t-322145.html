<br />
  I am working on an installer that will have to download some files during the installation process. I wonder which plugin to use for that. I know downloading files during installation could be a failure point in the installer and thus I'd like a plugin that is the most reliable (works on Windows XP/Vista/7, 32/64 bit) and has the minimum dependencies on external libraries (if at all).<br />
<br />
  Any experience? is inetc the one to use or something else?</div></div><hr />

The main problem comes from people who simply do not have an internet connection / go through a proxy that requires logging in first (think some hotel wifi services) / are on a VPN that blocks access - and, of course, problems with the internet resource itself (site down and such).  Can't really do anything about those cases, though, and you'd run into them with all of the plugins ( note that there aren't exactly many of them.. nsisdl is included, inetload is essentially deprecated by inetc ).</div></div><hr />
