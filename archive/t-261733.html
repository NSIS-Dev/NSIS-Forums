<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fashtas</div><div class="date">14th December 2006, 00:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to get 2 different directory screens working in an installer.<br />
<br />
One has the path for the program files, and adds the Default Program Directory to the end if the user browses to a new path <br />
<br />
The second has the path for the data files, and does *not* want to append anything to the end of the path if the uses browses somewhere other than the initial default<br />
<br />
I've attached a cut down version of the code I am using which will add &quot;myTest2PathDir&quot; to the end of any browsed to path on both directory windows.<br />
<br />
I am aware that if I add a backslash at the end of the path for the install directory (thus)...<br />
<br />
<br />
InstallDir &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\myTest2PathDir\&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
...I can avoid the adding to the end of a browse path, but ideally I want it for the one (program), not the other (data)</div></div><hr />

Yes I looked at that page before. It doesn't actually compile, and if I fix the code by commenting out 2 lines, it is looking for a icon file that doesn't exist [line 26] and calling !insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE [line 59] which cannot be found) it doesn't seem to work correctly<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is the MUI_RESERVEFILE_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE I removed? I was unsure what that is supposed to do<br />
<br />
At any rate the two data directory screens both share the same path, changing one changes the other, and neither append anything when browsing which is what I wanted to do with the install path<br />
<br />
From a little debugging, it seems the PRE event is never being called<br />
<br />
I had also investigated the forum link on that page, but it seems as if it is referencing older MUI builds? For example it uses !insertmacro MUI_PAGECOMMAND_DIRECTORY  which won't compile, where as !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY not only compiles but works well</div></div><hr />

I guess you should set up a custom page for the second (data) dir.</div></div><hr />
