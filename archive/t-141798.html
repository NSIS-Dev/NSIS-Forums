<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bSecRes</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a list box that I create on-the-fly for a custom page. For several reasons it would be great if I could have a default selection of the items:<br />
<br />
1. I load this list box with potentially hundreds of items. For 99% of the people that will use the app, they'll only care about a couple of the items and won't want to have to dig to find them. Sure I could presort the list with the normal ones at the top but...<br />
<br />
2. Because of the method I have to use to harvest the list, it takes a while to display the listboxes and impatient users will click next before they even see that listboxes are there. <br />
<br />
3. Some people won't know what the options really are and I would like to preselect the safe/normal items for them. <br />
<br />
Please consider adding this to the que or telling me why my idea is flawed. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 04:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand you. in the subject you say: &quot;No PreSelect&quot; but in the body you say that you want to preselect.<br />
<br />
In case you want to preselect (I asume you are talking of InstallOptions) you can add a &quot;State=selected-item-you-want&quot; in the ini. Is that enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bSecRes</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 05:44</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading your answer I went back and tested my code some more it seems you are correct. The problem was that I have multiple ListItems with the same name. Only in the case of a unique name will it select something preloaded in the state field. Makes sense to me, it just so happens that all of the &quot;normal&quot; vaules that are in my list that I wanted to preselect all have duplicates also (Only those have duplicates in fact). Sorry for wasting your time, I spent a lot of time testing this but I never even considered the duplicate bit. Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
Example of problem:<br />
[Field X]<br />
Type=ListBox<br />
Left=0<br />
Right=140<br />
Top=11<br />
Bottom=100<br />
Flags=MultiSelect|EXTENDEDSELCT<br />
ListItems=--Nomral--|Jane|Gina|--Everyone--|Jane|Gina|Beth<br />
State=Jane|Gina<br />
<br />
The result is nothing shows up selected</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Field X]<br />
Type=ListBox<br />
Left=0<br />
Right=140<br />
Top=11<br />
Bottom=100<br />
Flags=MultiSelect|EXTENDEDSELCT<br />
ListItems=--Nomral--|Jane|Gina|--Everyone--|Jane|Gina|Beth<br />
State=Jane<br />
<br />
<br />
You had Jane and Gina to be readily selected, but of course, how can you have 2 selected?<br />
You can't.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Ok with multiselect on, then you should be able to.<br />
Is this a bug?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bSecRes</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Status now is that I can do it. I don't know if someone fixed it or not, I just downloaded the latest CVS I may have been using an old version, but now it selects the first instance of that name in the list even when there are duplicates.</div></div><hr />
