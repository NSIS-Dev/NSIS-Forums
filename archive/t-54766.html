<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cchian</div><div class="date">13th July 2001, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to write a utility that will run the following command:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\InstallShield Installation Information\{CEE2C9FF-FAB4-4A36-B2CD-862C26A58E7E}\setup.exe<br />
<br />
I works fine if I browse to the folder and double-click on setup.exe, but somehow I cannot make it work under NSIS. This is the line I am trying to execute:<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\InstallShield Installation Information\{CEE2C9FF-FAB4-4A36-B2CD-862C26A58E7E}\setup.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Never mind. I finally made it work by specifying SetOutPath.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th July 2001, 06:56</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, Here is the problem. Other people DON'T have that number. I don't even have that number. It might be a smart idea to place the exe file in another Directory and then try to execute it. AND the Line is:<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$PROGRAMFILES\InstallShield Installation Information\{CEE2C9FF-FAB4-4A36-B2CD-862C26A58E7E}\setup.exe&quot;' <br />
Every thing looks good, but make sure that the EXE might not work for other people.<br />
<br />
+this is just a wait of a thread if you figure it out.</div></div><hr />
