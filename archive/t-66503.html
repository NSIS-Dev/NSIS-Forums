<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BitRider</div><div class="date">23rd November 2001, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, here comes a new version of L-NSIS, version 1.67.1, its based on NSIS 1.67. (L for localizable, I needed something to say its not the original NSIS, but a modification).<br />
<br />
Before all, say I'm sorry for the piece of shit I upload a few days ago. This version is smaller, complete and a relase version. (previous one was a test version I made &amp; fogot to recompile).<br />
<br />
From now version numering will be NSIS_MAYOR.NSIS_MINOR.L-NSIS_VERSION.<br />
<br />
download here (http://www.geocities.com/rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis167.1.zip) and rename to .exe. (Geocities doesn't allows to upload executables directly).<br />
<br />
Please if you like it, report bugs, suggestions, whatever you think in to improve it (I mean releated to SetText &amp; run-time localization). I'm thinking on a ReadLicenseDataFromFile function, what do you think about ?. <br />
<br />
It's another history but... Today, in my country (Spain), two people (a policeman and a policeman wife) has been killed by Vaske Terrorists (wrongly called &quot;Vaske Independentits&quot; in some countries outside Spain). Let's call things by its name, let's call'em killers. <br />
<br />
New in this version:<br />
<br />
* Partially rewrite code<br />
+ Text are processed before be setted (for example if you write $0 as second parameter to SetText it will be extend to the content of $0), Except for FileErrorText &amp; LicenseData, they must be written as you want they to appear in the screen.<br />
+ Most Install &amp; uninstalls text are supported (installation types texts &amp; sections text not supported *YET*)<br />
+ Included an external program program to let user to choose installation language (it's optional &amp; makes L-NSIS to be a bit slower on init after choosing language, it's due to the script used to load language strings, it must wait to an INI file to be ready).<br />
+ L-NSIS packaged made with L-NSIS &amp; localized to Spanish (both english &amp; spanish are supported in the same installation). Uff, now I'm thinking about... if you see 'French' don't choose it, it isn't yet supported (all the messages will appear in english).<br />
+ Added loadlang.nsh a script to load all the avaliable texts from an INI file.<br />
- No updates in the GUI, this means that if you set a text while it's in the screen it will not be referesh (it will be changed internally but not in the screen). Working on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FreeNsisTweaker</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Please fix the download link! It doesn't work.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BitRider</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for reporting broken link. It appear to be an error on IE or GeoCities, I'm not able to download it using IE 5.5 but I'm able to download it with GetRight. <br />
<br />
Well, I've removed previous file an uploaded a new one.<br />
<br />
Now you can download it as a real zip file (just unzip it to get .exe file) as Duane suggested.<br />
<br />
DownloadHERE !! (http://www.geocities.com//rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis1.zip). It should work fine with IE.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BitRider</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, previously posted link was really broken (I wrotte a double slash into the link &amp; pressed POST instead PREVIEW). <br />
<br />
Use this:  DOWNLOAD HERE !! (www.geocities.com/rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis1.zip) <br />
<br />
Well, geocities+IE continue saying this is wrong. When I use my download manager (GetRight) I don't get *ANY* problem. Plase try with a download manager or wait till I can found another free server.<br />
<br />
When I type this URL by hand in IE &quot;Address:&quot; editbox it simply does download perfectly. <br />
<br />
It appear to be an IE, Geocities or I-don't-know-what error.<br />
<br />
Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FreeNsisTweaker</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the positive reply to my message.<br />
But honestly, my own version features only some small (documentation, filenames,etc) changes.<br />
I can recommend the free(host) that I use by myself, so that's freeservers.com . You could try this service if you like.</div></div><hr />
