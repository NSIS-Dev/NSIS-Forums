<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fazerty</div><div class="date">15th December 2011, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I've an installer called setup.exe created with nsis.<br />
setup.exe is an archive: I can explore it using an unzipper like 7-zip.<br />
The setup.exe will install several files. The problem I want to solve is that one of these files have to be modified very frequently. As it is very fast to update a file within an archive using a software like 7za compared to of compilation of the setup.exe I asked if is it possible to update a file within a setup.exe without a compilation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you could replace the file, the installer would then fail with checksum error.<br />
<br />
You'd have to disable CRC check (bad idea!) or modify the checksum too - but that's probably not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Instead, you could leave the problematic file outside the installer and just have the installer copy it over.<br />
<br />
If necessary, you could simply bundle the installer.exe and the additional file in a simple 7-Zip SFX file, for example.<br />
<br />
Or you could append the extra file to the end of the installer EXE after compiling the installer...</div></div><hr />
