<br />
1. for creating a script, that creates automaticaly patches of my software, i need this function:<br />
first, list the whole content (all files including subdirs) of the new directory (containing the latest files).<br />
<br />
2. then it should scan the other directory, for the same files in the same directories. for every file that exists in an old and a new version, it should automaticaly create a patch-file with genpat.exe from the vpatch-plugin in a third directory (with same subdirs).<br />
<br />
3. if there's no old version for the new file, it should copy the complete new file to the patch-directory (in the correct subdir).<br />
<br />
now, i've mentioned those actions as single functions, but they will be done in batch-work, means, that every time a new file has been found, the script would look after an old version, and patch and so on.<br />
<br />
i've already solutions to search through the new directory.<br />
i also know how to create patches and copy files. but i've problems to keep the same path-structure in different root-directories.<br />
<br />
e.g. 'c:\test\old\...' contains all the old files, c:\test\new\... the new ones and all the patch-files should be copied to c:\test\patch\...<br />
<br />
did anyone understand my horrible english? :D<br />
an if yes, does anyone know, how to do this?<br />
<br />
thanx for any help</div></div><hr />

The current directory is known already if you search the new and old paths recursively, so it shouldn't be a problem.</div></div><hr />
