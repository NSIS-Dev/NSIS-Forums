<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torsten Bronger</div><div class="date">22nd September 2002, 04:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I use 'Legacy NSIS 1.98' from Sourceforge on Win98.<br />
<br />
When I include user dialogs with InstallOptions.dll and another window is above the NSIS window, the NSIS window -- brought to front again -- is empty.  It can be rewritten by temporarily being moved outside the screen.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else seen something similar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd September 2002, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using BringToFront to bring it back or does the user do it manually? I see no problem when the user brings it back. Does it work for you with IO's simple test.nsi script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sailo</div><div class="date">23rd September 2002, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have experienced this problem if i call IO from within a section. If i call it from .onNextPage it seems to work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torsten Bronger</div><div class="date">26th September 2002, 03:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly that's my experience, too.  Unfortunarely this seems to mean that I can have only one IO dialog.  But I managed to pack everything into it.<br />
<br />
A 'refresh window' function would be nice and could help not only here.  E.g. I switched off a section via SectionSetFlags but it didn't appear on screen (the checkbox was still marked).  I had to go to the previous page (licence agreement) and back to see the refreshed version.<br />
<br />
Thank for your help.</div></div><hr />

Where did you call SectionSetFlags?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torsten Bronger</div><div class="date">26th September 2002, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">'Is there a problem showing multiple dialogs in the same .onNextPage?'  -- To be honest, I don't want to try this, because it works now.  However, the problem is the windows refresh.  When the user goes to the next page (and .onNextPage is called) I can be sure about that -- but *whithin* a page it's apparently a little bit shaky.<br />
<br />
'Where did you call SectionSetFlags?' -- After clicking 'Next' on the components selection page, a special if clause in .onNextPage opens up to two MessageBoxes with special licence agreements of certain selected components.  When having clicked on 'No', I wanted to disable that component.  This works, but the respective chekbox is still marked.  Going back the very fist page (Licence Agreement) and then back to the components page solves this problem -- then the box is empty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have found the cause for the sections not updating and I will fix it, but I will fix it for NSIS 2, not 1.98. I can send you the lines involved and a compiled version if you really need it, but there won't be any new version of the &quot;legacy&quot; NSIS.<br />
<br />
Fixed in the latest version in the CVS</div></div><hr />

<br />
(I didn't use NSIS 2 because I needed something reliable, and I didn't know how much version 2 had settled.  That's much more important to me than these minor problems.)</div></div><hr />
