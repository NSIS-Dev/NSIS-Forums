<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erpo</div><div class="date">15th December 2004, 04:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know why the special build (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/download/specialbuilds/) that does not use solid compression for the bzip2 and lzma algorithms is implemented as a &quot;special build&quot; instead of a command in a script file? Is it possible that this feature could be integrated as an option into the main distribution?<br />
<br />
This would be very helpful to me, as I need to make both large and small installers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">15th December 2004, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have two copies of makensis.exe, one that is the special build and one that isn't. You'll just have to copy and paste the exe when necessary.<br />

<br />
That is what I ended up doing, and it worked very well. At first I thought the special build downloads linked to an entirely separate installation of NSIS instead of just a new copy of makensis.exe (i.e. I thought I would have to uninstall one fully and install the other to switch between them.).<br />
<br />
I'm still curious about why this particular option is only available at compile time for makensis.exe. Why is it, for example, that there is a SetCompressor &lt;zlib|bzip2|lzma&gt; command, but no SetSolidCompression &lt;on|off&gt; command?</div></div><hr />

Similarely you cannot set the current NSIS_MAX_STRLENGTH without recompiling the makensis source.<br />

Time is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">4th January 2005, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that a script command MaxStrLen should be a 'feature request' perhaps :)<br />
<br />
That would be very very cool...<br />
