<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myne</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 02:51</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS compression works best on files that are not already compressed.<br />
<br />
Example : If nsis compresses a 5mb .zip file full of 10mb .txt it wont go much smaller than 5mb.<br />
<br />
Example : If nsis compresses the 10mb .txt's it should go lower than 5mb - maybe as low as 2 - 3mb.<br />
<br />
So dont compress with UPX.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, I've tried to make this as simple as possible. I hope you understand it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The latest NSIS 2 version support LZMA compression, which performs very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">afaik, upx doesn't compress txt files, only exes.<br />
<br />
I just tested with the program DC++ and using UPX made the installer 21kB smaller, always with LZMA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">UPX should only be used to compress the exehead (use !packhdr), it will save a few KB's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">the 21kB I said was for the exe *in* the installer, nothing to do with the header.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole point of UPX is that it can be used to compress executables files and keep them executable. If you add files to an archive UPX won't be an efficient method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what you mean for eficient, but if you mean 'smaller', then, it can be more eficient to compress with upx first.<br />
<br />
UPX is designed to compress exes, LZMA is designed to compress anything. UPX can therefore be optimized for some things lzma is not.<br />
<br />
I don't want to insist on this, but I've done various installers and upxing the exe before building the installer always gave better results.</div></div><hr />

you are right in nsis zlib/lzma <br />
not sure in bzip2 <br />
not in ms's makecab,you can find in ms's ieak</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, miracles do not exist ;) <br />
<br />
anyway, what does this mean?<br />
<br />
UPX is a free, portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for several different executable formats. It achieves an excellent compression ratio and offers very fast decompression. Your executables suffer no memory overhead or other drawbacks because of in-place decompression. <br />
<br />
the &quot;no memory overhead&quot; part. I thought it *had* overhead :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">8th January 2004, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If you only start one instance it won't be such a problem, but with multiple instances it will definately use more memory.<br />
<br />
LZMA works fine for EXE files too. Because it doesn't have to create executables, the compression is usually better.</div></div><hr />
