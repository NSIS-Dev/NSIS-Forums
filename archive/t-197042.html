But, Win98SE and WinME users are saying that it will not install at all. I've had 7 people test it and they say on these OS they double click on the *.exe I made and nothing loads/starts.  Any suggestions?  Works PERFECT on WinXP and Win2000.<br />
<br />
I have a splash screen that shows and then I install to the registry for Add/remove hardware but the coding is fine, or seems fine. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

IMHO NSIS looks very good on Win98 too, so 1) remove CVS updates and test distribution with stable 2.0 or 2.01 version; 2) check Win98 compatibility of your script - API calls, registry nodes, etc..</div></div><hr />
