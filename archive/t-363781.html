<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ed@ap</div><div class="date">15th June 2013, 04:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using a FileRequest control on a dialog to select a file.  Sometimes the file will be in use by another program and I'll get a message: &quot;This file is in use.  Enter a new name or close the file that's open in another program.&quot;  <br />
<br />
All I'm doing here is choosing the file name.  I'm not attempting to open the file or do anything with it.  All I want to do is write the file name to an ini file for later use.   Is there a setting or some way to configure the dialog so that I can chose the file name even if the file is open in another program?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
