<br />
I have been doing a bit of research on how to implement an IP-Address box in an NSIS installer. For those of you who are familiar with writing MFC apps using Visual Studio, I'm trying to achieve the equivalence of an &quot;IP Address Control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically I want the textbox to look like a normal one, except with four periods. Here is an example:<br />
<br />

<br />
When the user tries to type something in, I want to restrict their input to only numbers, three digits at a time. For example, when I type in &quot;192&quot; I want the cursor to parse just past the first period. In the case &quot;.&quot; is typed I want to parse past the next period. This is implemented in Windows' TCP/IP connection properties dialog, which can be reached in WinXP by opening Network Connections and right clicking on a connection-&gt;Properties and clicking on Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) and clicking Properties button.<br />
<br />
I know it's not straightforward to do something like this using InstallOptions, but I would like to know if any of you have seen or written a plugin that might help. As always, any help is greatly appreciated :D.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Joe</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I should have cleared this up in my initial post: I currently have an InstallOptions page that reads in two ip-addresses and two subnet masks (in form 192.168.1.0/16). Is there a way to incorporate this into an InstallOptions script (or something to that effect)?</div></div><hr />

Also I've read that it's difficult to get this to work fine in MUI, especially if you're using regular InstallOptions. Would I have to resort to hacking the C++ code of the InstallOptions plugin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">28th July 2006, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Regular InstallOptions works fine with MUI and I don't see why IOEx won't work.<br />
You don't need to use the MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_* macro's at all.<br />
They just mask the InstallOptions plugin calls with a friendlier syntax.<br />
