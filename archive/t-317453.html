<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abcdgoldfish</div><div class="date">3rd March 2010, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have written a custom page that contains a DirRequest box that can be populated either by a directory browser or by manually typing a directory path.<br />
<br />
The code for this page tests if the last directory in the path is a specific word.  If it is, then allow the Install button to proceed.  If it is not, then pop up a message box with instructions.  After Okaying the button, stay on the page and let the user try again.<br />
<br />
The way I do this is to have the function call itself.  Recursion seems like the wrong approach but it works - almost.  I have been unable to figure out a way to make the Back and Cancel buttons behave as expected.<br />
<br />
Keeping track of the state of the DirRequest is not sufficient because these buttons should be able to do their actions regardless of its state.  But I don't see how to work around this.<br />
<br />
This seems like a fairly normal operation and I would have expected to find some info on it but I've come up empty.  I'd appreciate any help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See the NSIS User Manual for information and some sample code:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abcdgoldfish</div><div class="date">3rd March 2010, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Oddly enough, I had already tried the &quot;leave&quot; function and was not getting the expected results.  I thought it may have had to to with the fact that my page didn't have a Next button but an Install button.  I was verifying this condition as I was writing this and suddenly it began to work.  I'm not usually in favor of Then a Miracle Occurs code but unless the problem re-manifests I'll just mush on.</div></div><hr />
