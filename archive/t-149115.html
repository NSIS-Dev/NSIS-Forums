It's not through website .I do have an html help page which i show after the User has successfully installed the software.<br />
But its an offline User guide . <br />
<br />
I am not sure how I can do that . <br />
Does anyone has tried this before ?<br />

The problem is that the cookie will be used by some of our websites.<br />
So I don't think the ini file will serve the purpose :(</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by opening a site ?<br />
Do you want me to open some website for that purpose :((</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by opening a site ?<br />
Do you want me to open some website for that purpose :(( Yes, I think he means that. Cookies are normally only used when visiting websites. So it would be logical to use a webbrowser session to set the cookie. Afterall, you don't know which browser the user uses, so even if you succeed in adding cookie-support to your installer it's likely to work only for some browsers. Netscape and Internet Explorer use a different way of storing cookies, so there's no general rule for creating cookies.<br />
<br />
I don't know why you want to use the cookie, but I assume it's for registration purposes? Well, then you can let the installer visit a website after a succesful installation. Just pass the values you want stored in a cookie in the URL. Example:<br />
<br />
http://my.server.com/registration.php?email=tom@internet.com&amp;serial=1234456<br />
<br />
Make sure this PHP-page sets the cookie you want.</div></div><hr />
