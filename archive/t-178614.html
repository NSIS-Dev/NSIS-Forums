<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wasteland</div><div class="date">1st May 2004, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">City of Heroes (http://www.cityofheroes.com) was released earlier this week, and is being received with much excitement (currently #3 on Yahoo's Video Game Buzz Index (http://buzz.yahoo.com/video_games/)).<br />
<br />
As some of you might know, from helping me in the past, the installer was created with NSIS, so this probably marks the most widespread game to use NSIS as their installer.  Anyway, feel free to add City of Heroes (http://www.cityofheroes.com) and Cryptic Studios (http://www.crypticstudios.com) to your list of programs/companies that use NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wasteland</div><div class="date">3rd May 2004, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">If I even had access to the website, I'd drop it in there, but that's handled by our publisher.  I did ensure the Nullsoft brandind text is visible on the installer though if that counts for anything =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">3rd May 2004, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">That's fine, there doesn't have to be a link to NSIS on every site of an application that uses it. Most users of the game don't use installer systems anyway.</div></div><hr />
