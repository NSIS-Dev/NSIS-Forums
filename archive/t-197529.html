<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">the_puzzle</div><div class="date">26th October 2004, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Having issues with the below line in the script:<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;set&gt;C:\etc\xyz.conf&quot; $R4 <br />
<br />
I also tried the below mentioned cmds as an alternative:<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;set&quot; $R4 (this works)<br />
ExecWait '&quot;set&quot; &gt; C:\etc\xyz.conf' $R4 (this doesn't work)<br />
ExecWait '&quot;set&quot;&gt;C:\etc\xyz.conf' $R4 (this doesn't work)<br />
<br />
I want to direct the output of ExecWait cmd &quot;set&quot; directly to a file C:\etc\xyz.conf. My question here is tht does the '&gt;' sign work or not..if not is there a way to direct the output to a file other than FileOpen ? Secondly, how do I stop the command window from popping on the screen whenever ExecWait executes a command ?<br />
<br />
All comments and help much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">use the nsExec plugin (\NSIS\Contrib\nsExec\nsExec.txt for more info)</div></div><hr />

nsExec::Exec '$0 /C set $R4 &gt; C:\etc\xyz.conf'<br />
<br />
Try that. You may have to experiment with quotation marks as I don't know how set likes its arguments passed, but that should roughly do it.<br />
<br />
This isn't execWaiting which I assume is what you want, but it's the best I found when I tried to do the same. Also, if you want to append to the xyz.conf file rather than replace it, use &gt;&gt; instead of &gt;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps <br />
<br />

nsExec does wait actually</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">the_puzzle</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank You guys for your replies to my post, nsExec thing worked but not to the point, I need to have the return code into $R4, but $R4 is empty after the command is executed.<br />
<br />
 This is what I used in the script:<br />
 nsExec::Exec '$0 /C set $R4 &gt; C:\etc\xyz.conf'<br />
 nsExec::Exec '$0 /C &quot;set $R4 &gt; C:\etc\xyz.conf&quot;'<br />
 nsExec::Exec '$0 /C &quot;set&quot; $R4 &gt; C:\etc\xyz.conf'<br />
<br />
  Any ideas as to why this must've happened ?<br />
<br />
  Thanx Guys !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;If nsExec is unable to execute the process, it will return &quot;error&quot;<br />
on the top of the stack, if the process timed out it will return<br />
&quot;timeout&quot;, else it will return the return code from the<br />
executed process.&quot;<br />
<br />
so i guess you just have to do:<br />
nsExec::Exec ...<br />
pop $R4</div></div><hr />
