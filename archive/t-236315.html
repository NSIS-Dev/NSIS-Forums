<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shrekkie</div><div class="date">24th January 2006, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I am in a minor dilemma at the moment. Here's what I have to do:<br />
<br />
I have an application for the pocket PC that comes in many different languages, i.e. each language has its own files. Because of this, I need to create different setup executables for each language. I need to basically write an NSIS script that will change the !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE to any language I want.<br />
<br />
For example, I am thinking of having a batch file that will take the language as a parameter and basically collect all those language specific files and build a cab file. So based on that parameter I need to change the MUI_LANGUAGE in the NSIS script too. I know I can have multiple NSIS script files but that would be really inefficient, I want to change it through the batch file.<br />
<br />
One of the ideas I had was that I can create a text file with all the parameters in it through the batch file, then read the file in the NSIS script and change the MUI_LANGUAGE on &quot;.oninit&quot;. Is this idea feasible?<br />
<br />
One other thing I need to do is that I need to replace the welcome screen page in the MUI with another page that displays a readme file that is also language specific, i.e. the readme filename is different for every language. How can this be done? Can someone provide some sample code for adding a custom page such as this...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..<br />
<br />
Shrekkie</div></div><hr />

i'd prefer different header files for every language.<br />
<br />
i'd do it like that:<br />
in you main.nsi:<br />
<br />
!include ${lang}.nsh<br />
<br />
(directly after you included the page macros, where you would normally place the !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE)<br />
<br />
then in each language's header file:<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;&lt;language&gt;&quot;<br />
&lt;add your custom language strings here&gt;<br />
<br />
now, you may compile the versions by using commandlineswitch  like this:<br />
/Dlang=english<br />
/Dlang=french<br />
/Dlang=german</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shrekkie</div><div class="date">24th January 2006, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">so I just create header files for every language, and include them all in the script? And based on the commandline  parameter, this would choose the appropriate language?</div></div><hr />
