<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dans</div><div class="date">28th May 2007, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize, but this is a pretty basic question.<br />
I was trying to use !define to have conditional actions in the install/uninstall process until I released jumping over the !define lines wasn't really skipping them. How can I have this functionality in NSIS? I basically want to set a &quot;flag&quot; in the onInit function and know about it or the lack of it in the main section.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Compile time instructions begin with a &quot;!&quot; symbol and get processed once while your setup is compiling.  Compile time conditionals include !if, !ifdef,and !ifmacrodef.  The !define command is also a compile-time command<br />
<br />
Run-time conditionals are processed at runtime (when the user is actually running the installation). <br />
<br />
Based on your explanation, I'd say you are likely looking for a run-time conditional.  <br />
<br />
LogicLib, can make run-time decisions easy. Let's say you use use the variable $Flag to control.  You might use something like this:<br />
<br />
${If} $Flag == &quot;1&quot;<br />
   ; do something here for flag value 1<br />
${Else}<br />
   ; do something here for other flag values<br />
${EndIf}</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />
