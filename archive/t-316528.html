<br />
I have written my script as it pops up a message box when user tried to re-install or uninstall the application. I used to check whether the application is running by using FindWindow command. But now I fond a problem of using this method since my installer contains more than one application (a package). So if I use this method I may have to check for each and every window class. Also I've fond that this method doesn't work for other computers since the window class value is changing in different machines.<br />
Can someone suggest me a solution for this...</div></div><hr />

<br />
First thanks for your reply MSG.<br />
I tried with Processes plug-In. But if I'm using a package again I have to check for each and every process included in the package.<br />
I'm trying to give a message to user when an unnstallation was not success due to some reasons like uninstalling file or dll has been using by some other program. If I didn't give a message the files which are held by other process, will remain.<br />
What I wanna do is checking whether the uninstallation is possible before continuing it, if it's possible then only continue the uninstallation.</div></div><hr />
