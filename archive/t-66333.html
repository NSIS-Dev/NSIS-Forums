<br />

Good job. I have to admit, your wizard was much better than mine. There are a couple of problems with the wizard, however. A couple of the back buttons and the exit button don't work. Also, in my wizard there was a start menu creator. Could that be added in there somewhere. Good job with the guy though. It's wonderful.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">23rd November 2001, 03:31</div></div><div class="posttext">thx man, i'll add the start menu creator and fix those bugs before the final rlz on dec 15th.<br />
<br />
thx again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackbar</div><div class="date">24th November 2001, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. I've seen slate blue before and like it. Anyway I've written an app known as cEdit (http://cedit.sourceforge.net) or (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cedit)<br />
<br />
It uses a control (codemax) for syntax highlighting. Anyway I built in support for the nsis language so if you want to have a look at it and strip bits you need from it to enhance your program feel free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">what a very generous offer.  thank you much.  i have also seen cEdit, and have to say it's great.  i am hesitant, however, to include any OCX files that aren't needed.  maybe the codemax ocx is needed :)<br />
<br />
thanks again,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackbar</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 00:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Well probably not needed but it's an awesome control and it's opensource/free so both are solid aspects in it's favor. I was actually thinking of generating a plugin for cEdit to use to generate nsis scripts but I saw you already had something good going I couldn't see the point :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">good point.<br />
<br />
maybe we should collaborate on a project sometime :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackbar</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Might be cool. Perhaps you could create a slate blue plugin for cEdit. You'd be more than welcome to have a link to your site on it. You can contact me at devedit@yahoo.com :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackbar</div><div class="date">25th November 2001, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd also like to know how you caught the output of the compiler. Thats pretty cool :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were a few runtime errors, but hey, get those worked out and you have a Prog you can be proud of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackbar</div><div class="date">26th November 2001, 04:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to be sure when you say runtime errors are you referring to slateblue or cEdit? Just wanna be positive :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">26th November 2001, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">what were the runtime errors, and when did they occur?<br />
<br />
ackbar: i used the nsis dll provided by the great pjw62, which returns the compiler info via an hWND.<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackbar</div><div class="date">26th November 2001, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I read some info on the pipe's like suggested above and managed to write some code along with thread's to catch a shell's output :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiffi</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
can you (liquidmotion, pjw62, ...) please tell me how to get the NSIS-compiler dll?<br />
On which version of NSIS is the dll based?<br />
Is it difficult to make so an dll of a new (future versions) of NSIS?<br />
Are the changes at NSIS to get a NSIS dll OpenSource?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help!<br />
<br />
<br />
Fiffi</div></div><hr />
