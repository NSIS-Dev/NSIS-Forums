<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treehousetim</div><div class="date">17th May 2004, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to use the radio button macros in sections.nsh which I wrote, but I'm having some weirdness using them.<br />
<br />
When I unselect all sections in the page pre or show function then try to select a single section<br />
<br />
in the same function it  works visually but when I click on one of the unselected sections, both sections become checked.<br />
<br />
It's like the section isn't actually being checked unless the user clicks on it,<br />
or perhaps the flags aren't being set unless the user clicks on the section.<br />
<br />
I'm attaching a sample script that demonstrates this behavior<br />
<br />
any help is appreciated.<br />

<br />
Is it similar to the problem I was having?<br />
Odd section selection behaviour?  (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=172594&amp;highlight=zimsms)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I don't think this is related to the problem you were having.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treehousetim</div><div class="date">20th May 2004, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">does anyone else have any thoughts on this issue?<br />
<br />
This is something that would be very helpful to have resolved.<br />
<br />
My goal is to be able to store the name of a section in the registry, then use that to pre-select a section in the installer.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, if I pre-select the section other sections can be selected without the pre-selection being unselected.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
