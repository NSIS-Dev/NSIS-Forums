<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyakite</div><div class="date">12th November 2005, 10:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple of custom .exe tools written in NSIS that my main installer uses.  I want to make sure that before my main script compiles the other tools compile, so that the exes are always as up-to-date as possible, since they all rely on a seperate .nsi file containing special defines/functions.<br />
<br />
I'm using HM NIS Edit as well for editing and compiling, but if I have to compile some other way (via a batch file for instance) then I can switch, although a solution within HM NIS Edit would be nice.<br />
<br />
I did search for an answer to this, and didn't come up with anything which surprised me, because I figured this efinitely would have been asked before.</div></div><hr />
