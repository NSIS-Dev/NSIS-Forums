<br />
Lost, very lost, tried a few different methods, basically if you use a finish page after a Installation Page it skips by before you have time to view it, also the show details section flips by when using a finishing page, using the Modern UI.<br />
<br />
If a finishing page is not used then it's fine, well in the instructions it says:<br />
<br />
Text to display on the header of the installation page when the installation has been completed (won't be displayed when using a Finish page without MUI_(UN)FINISHPAGE_NOAUTOCLOSE).<br />
<br />
Ok I have tried a few things to make this work and have been unable to get it to stop and allow the user to Show Details after using a finishing page.<br />
<br />
Code Below:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES<br />
  !define  MUI_(UN)FINISHPAGE_NOAUTOCLOSE<br />
<br />
  !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN &quot;Program.exe&quot;<br />
  !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_NOTCHECKED<br />
  <br />
  !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_FINISH<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong? The part in the instructions is extremely vague to me, this could mean alot of things when coding. Maybe I'm a little slow, but I do not get it.<br />
<br />
Text to display on the header of the installation page when the installation has been completed (won't be displayed when using a Finish page without MUI_(UN)FINISHPAGE_NOAUTOCLOSE).<br />
<br />
Anyone with some incite on this matter would be great.<br />
<br />
Basically what I want it to do is allow the person to still view the SHOW Details and then press next to go to the finshing page, and allow user to start EXE.<br />
<br />
Thanks All<br />
Edward</div></div><hr />

The brackets show that this page can be used on the uninstaller as well. To use on the uninstaller, define as 'MUI_UNFINISHPAGE_NOAUTOCLOSE'.</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit slow, nice call Mate! Maybe after a few years I would have got that, LOL!:) Just started to figure modern out, used to just paste the examples, now I'm actually doing it, using VB6.0 and this wrapper software. I LIKE, I LIKE, I LIKE!<br />
<br />
Thanks Again!<br />
