After uninstallation of my app, i noticed there are still several files in the C:\System Volume Information\_restore... sub-folders. Now we cant directly access System Volume Information. we cant hard code it coz the folder names will change from PC to PC, for eg. the _restore {changeable values} folder.<br />
<br />
So how do i delete these entries?<br />
<br />
i appreciate your time and help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherdeg</div><div class="date">16th April 2008, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you simply shouldn't remove them...System Volume Information is used to save the data used for System Restore functionality.<br />
<br />
What if a customer accidentally uninstalls you application and would like to recover it by using System Restore? <br />
<br />
If you succeed deleting your files from System Volume Information during uninstall, the customer wouldn't be able to recover...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But after complete uninstall, if there are still traces of the program in the sys restore folder, it means that the app hasnt truly been completely uninstalled right? <br />
<br />
So how to go around that problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it as if someone copied a file from the installation directory and stored it somewhere else - you can't control it, and no one would expect you to know if that happened (let alone where the copy is stored afterwards).<br />
<br />
An uninstaller should remove everything the corresponding installer added (with some exceptions, of course, but it should never remove MORE than it added). You didn't add the file to System Restore in the installer, and therefore, you shouldn't delete it in the uninstaller.</div></div><hr />
