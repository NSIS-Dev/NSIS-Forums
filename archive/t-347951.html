<br />
I'm in need of a solution for a dilemma that I'm currently having. I've got an output log (see attachments) that is encoded in UTF-8 without BOM and I need to read it into the installer on runtime.<br />
<br />
Here's a snippet of the code.<br />
<br />
FileOpen $R9 &quot;$EXEDIR\output.log&quot; r<br />
	<br />
	StrCpy $1 &quot;&quot;<br />
	<br />
	read:<br />
		FileReadUTF16LE $R9 $0<br />
		StrCpy $1 &quot;$1$0&quot;<br />
		IfErrors done read<br />
	done:<br />
		<br />
	MessageBox MB_OK $1<br />
	<br />
	FileClose $R9<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem I'm having is that FileRead reads as ANSI and therefore the characters come out strange, where as FileReadUTF16LE gives me a garbled heap of junk when I run it.<br />
<br />
Manually converting the file in Notepad++ to UTF16LE and then reading it from there seems to work fine, but I need something that can do it programmatically.<br />
<br />
The only solutions I can think of, is either having a FileRead that does UTF8 or some way to convert my log to UTF16LE while keeping the contents the same (I've tried a few converters here, no luck whatsover)<br />
<br />
Any thought/ insight into this? I'm using Unicode NSIS v2.46.5 btw</div></div><hr />
