<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">3rd February 2007, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Advanced Uninstall Log is a macro system provided in a NSIS header that<br />
is able to monitor an installation and build an uninstall log file which<br />
is used by the uninstaller to uninstall files/directories that have been<br />
added within specific installation blocks.<br />
<br />
This means that files which have been installed outside these blocks,<br />
or added later either by the user or application's activities, ignored<br />
by the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
Moreover files that might exist into the target directory prior the current<br />
installation, ignored as well.<br />

Cool, Red Wine. My suggestion is to enable multilanguage support for the messages.  Thanks! I'm a bit dry of ideas on how to enable multilingual support and keep the high automation of the header at the same time, I'm tended to implement the same technique that I've implemented here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Readme_Page_Based_on_MUI_License_Page) , but I'd like to wait a little for a possible better suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobbeSweden</div><div class="date">29th November 2007, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for writing this header Red Wine!<br />
<br />
I needed to be able to localize the messages boxes it shows, so I made some modifications.<br />
<br />
If you don't need to make any localizations it will work just as it did before. But if you do need to change the strings it shows this is the way to do it with my version:<br />
<br />
!define UNINSTALLOG_LOCALIZE ;if you define this you have to provide language strings to use<br />
<br />
LangString UNLOG_HEADER ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;=========== Uninstaller Log please do not edit this file ===========&quot;<br />
LangString UNLOG_DAT_NOT_FOUND ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;${UNINST_DAT} not found, unable to perform uninstall.&quot;<br />
LangString UNLOG_DEL_FILE ${LANG_ENGLISH} 'Delete File &quot;$R9&quot;?'<br />
LangString UNLOG_DEL_DIR ${LANG_ENGLISH} 'Delete Directory &quot;$R9&quot;?'<br />
LangString UNLOG_EMPTY_DIR ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;Previous installation detected at $0.$\nRequired file ${UNINSTALL_LOG}.dat is missing.$\n$\nIt is highly recommended to select an empty directory and perform a fresh installation.&quot;<br />
LangString UNLOG_ERROR_LOG ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;Error in log ${UNINSTALL_LOG}.&quot;<br />
LangString UNLOG_ERROR_CREATE ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;Error creating ${UNINSTALL_LOG}.&quot;<br />
<br />
If UNINSTALLOG_LOCALIZE isn't defined the english language strings above will be used.<br />
<br />
This is the full header after my modifications:<br />

<br />
I ran into a problem with the example script &quot;&quot;Advanced Uninstall Log Demo&quot;. At uninstall there was a problem with removing empty directories. The code below prevented the uninstaller from hanging, but the real solution was to upgrade from Nsis 2.10 to Nsis 3.3 :) which solved the problem!<br />
<br />
<br />
!macro UNINSTALL.LOG_UNINSTALL_UNATTENDED<br />
  Function un._LocateCallBack_Function_Unattended<br />
    ....<br />
<br />
isdir:<br />
    RmDir &quot;$R9&quot;<br />
    IfErrors +1 isdir2<br />
    MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_OK &quot;Could not remove directory $R9&quot; /SD IDOK		<br />
    goto end<br />
isdir2:<br />
    IntOp $unlog_tmp_1 $unlog_tmp_1 + 1<br />
    goto end<br />
 <br />
<br />
I was going to ask for help, but this turned into an advice for people having similar problems with RmDir: Upgrade Nsis!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the script Red Wine! Though I would have liked some more comments in the source code... (AdvUninstLog.nsh)<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

Modifying the header is trivial, and includes replacing FileRead and FileWrite calls with FileReadUTF16LE and FileWriteUTF16LE. You also need to write a BOM at the begging of the file to make it unicode. But the header uses FileJoin macro from TextFunc header, and it can not deal with unicode files, so I had to replace the call for FileJoin with a custom macro inside the header - FileJoinUTF. It is a modification of FileJoin and all the credits go to it's author. Here is the patched header :</div></div><hr />

What i wanted to do with my uninstaller is that, the message box detection for newly created folder/directory will only pop up ignoring the files inside it and once the user wants to delete the folder the uninstaller will then also automatically delete the file/s inside it.<br />
Can you please help me on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xbarns</div><div class="date">4th February 2009, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
i have (as usual) a little problem. <br />
<br />
Even though all the necessary files are recorded in uninstall.dat they are not removed completely. <br />
<br />
I have a folder $InstDir\bin that is only partially emptied even though all files are recorded and should have been removed. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to log what gets deleted and what not (and maybe why?).<br />
<br />
The $InstDir\bin folder gets filled by different sections in between which other folders get created and filled. All other folders get removed nicely only bin stays (with quite a lot of files). Once i changed the Uninstall.dat to only contain the files that are in \bin and it worked nice, later i tried sorting so all \bin files are together in one section instead of being distributed over the uninstall.dat but that did not work either. I also tried to find out if those files are special in any way like special characters or so, but nope i couldn't find anything. <br />
<br />
Right at the beginning when i started implementing it it seemed to work nice, only a couple files were left but now....<br />
<br />
Strange but its late and i guess i can't think right either, any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">6th April 2009, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely it is due to the mentioned disadvantage of the header (especially noticeable when dealing with too many files on old-slower machines) which needs some effort to eliminate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">8th April 2009, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Since latest version of Unicode NSIS (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=277381) is able to parse an ansi script as unicode (doesn't need to convert the script prior to compile), I merged the above patch from high1 in one multi-functional header.<br />
<br />
This means there's only one header (which itself is ansi), who's able to utilize both NSIS flavors hence produce ansi or unicode uninstall.dat respectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for coding up this header. Its definitely a great addition to an already excellent product. <br />
<br />
However I am also having issues with the speed of the uninstall. I am uninstalling about 50mbs of an applicaiton which includes up to 2000 files. <br />
<br />
Do you think this header is just not suited to the characteristics of my application. Alternatively is there any code that I can change in the header file myself that might speed up the uninstall. <br />
<br />
BTW I am using the Unicode NSIS branch and I have used your latest script attached in this thread. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />

You're having difficulty with 50 mb? i have a 4gb++ installation to handle xD <br />
<br />
The uninstaller has been running for close to 2 hours now, and its still nowhere near done hahaha<br />

It would be nice if something could be done to speed this up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trobertson</div><div class="date">11th August 2009, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">From my own experiments it seems only files added inside $INSTDIR get removed. During my install process I install files in many different places, but only the ones in $INSTDIR get removed during uninstall even though all &quot;File ...&quot; calls are wrapped in the required UNINSTALL.LOG... macros. Is this normal/correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaMsTeYr</div><div class="date">11th August 2009, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not pro at NSIS, but did you check Uninstall.dat in INSTDIR post install to make sure that the directories were logged correctly?<br />
<br />
From what i can tell about the script, there shouldn't be limitations in install directories differing from INSTDIR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkeye64</div><div class="date">23rd August 2009, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to understand this script as I am relatively new to NSIS. There seems to be some &quot;magic&quot; happening here that I am trying to understand.<br />
<br />
Before capturing files, you insert the macro &quot;UNINSTALL.LOG_OPEN_INSTALL&quot;. Then call your &quot;File [options] [folder]&quot;. The macro contains &quot;${uninstall.log_install} &quot;${EXCLU_LIST}&quot; &quot;${UNINST_DAT}&quot; &quot;$OUTDIR&quot;&quot;. <br />
<br />
Exactly what I am trying to figure out is how all this work? How does the code in the macro get the information it needs?<br />
<br />
Is it that NSIS creates the &quot;exclude.tmp&quot; file in the $PLUGINSDIR, when using the &quot;File&quot; command, and this script then leverages it?</div></div><hr />

On that note, and since this is an old thread, yes, yes i do have a way to speed it up. I actually went in and rewrote the code into something a lot simpler, and so far i've not encountered any major problems with it.<br />

I had a couple of problems with the original PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT and PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY being replaced with INST_DIR_REG_ROOT and INSTDIR_REG_KEY, so I reverted that.  I also updated the script so that it pays attention to the name defined inside the UNINSTALL_LOG var.  I also noticed that it had problems removing folder outside of the base install directory (Such as those added to My Documents $DOCUMENTS), so I improved the uninstall loop to track any directories encountered.  Since the default $INSTDIR sometimes is not recorded in the log, you may need to do a manual push $INSTDIR<br />

<br />
I've noticed that most elements of the interactivity have been removed from your script... as well as any verification for the files having been changed.<br />
<br />
Any plans to implement more in regards to those aspects? (Final install directory will not be removed if unlisted files are present. :( )</div></div><hr />

I hated the fact that it would take forever just for the installer to search for existing files back and forth, so I chopped it down to a few simple commands.<br />
<br />
TBH though, I made those changed for my purposes, but they're not too difficult to modify. You could try making these modifications yourself, and see how you go, or if you detail it just a little bit more, maybe I'll help :P maybe. xD</div></div><hr />
