The problem, only FAT and FAT32 partitions should be listed/selectable. Is there any possibility to do this (as a replacement to the select destination directory)?<br />
<br />
if dll file would be required it's no problem, i know how to write them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">10th February 2004, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a page in the archive which describes how to get all avaialble drives and how to detect their type.  Once you got the list then you could create a custom page with a dropdown combobox from which the user can chose which drive to install to.<br />
