<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JeronimoColon</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 01:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently discovered NSIS and I think it's fantastic!<br />
<br />
I have already written 3 installation packages with it.<br />
<br />
I'm currently upgrading a very old Microsoft installation package (1997) to NSIS and it involves shelling out Microsoft Access Runtime.<br />
<br />
My question is I'm want to distribute this as an all-inclusive setup.exe so what's the best approach for this.<br />
<br />
The setup function for handling MSAccess Runtime's setup needs to include:<br />
1. Extracting it to a temporary folder.<br />
2. Shelling out the installation.<br />
3. Checking the error code.<br />
4. Cleaning up the temporary directory.<br />
<br />
Does NSIS have support for automating/shortcutting these steps or am I going to have to do each one.<br />
<br />
If I do have to perform each step - is my approach correct or is there a better way.<br />
<br />
Any recommendations, including what command I should use, would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Sincerest Thanks. :)<br />

<br />
4 steps = 3 simple lines of code.<br />
<br />
(in a section)<br />
<br />
File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\AccessSetup.exe AccessSetup.exe<br />
ExecWait $PLUGINSDIR\AcessSetup.exe $0<br />
StrCmp $0 &quot;0&quot; it_worked it_didnt_work<br />
<br />
$PLUGINSDIR is automatically deleted when the installer exits, but you could manually delete the setup program if you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, I did spend a great deal of time searching the forum.  Probably more that my employer would have liked me spending. :D <br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JeronimoColon</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to put this one down for a while so I didn't get a chance to test it.<br />
<br />
the &quot;/oname=$PLUGINSDIR\&quot; parameter will only allows one file to be copied at a time, so I don't think I can use this because the Access Runtime installer has great number of files and directories.<br />
<br />
So, to re-state my original question:<br />
Is there a better or recommended way of doing this?<br />
<br />
If not, I'll just copy the directory structure manaually - a pain, but what can you do...<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
