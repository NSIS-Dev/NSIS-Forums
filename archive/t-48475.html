<br />
http://jamintx.***********/splash.zip<br />
<br />
download this and you will have everything you want to do your splash screens... You'll find splash.exe and splash.bmp ... splash.bmp = the bitmap that will be shown 4 to 5 sec...<br />
<br />
if you have any question just ask... the download site is darn slow, can't do anything against that I guess :)<br />
<br />
peace</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did the same thing yesterday and let a friend of mine compile it with a c compiler.<br />
<br />
it is sized 10 kb, if you wanna download it with sourcecode look in my signiture.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nIRV</div><div class="date">29th April 2001, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe... I guess that was something fun to do... I am aware of 3 people doing this... just don't use mine which is 85k big and wait for the splash.exe of justin...<br />
<br />
let's have another fun feature to do ! ;)<br />
<br />
peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yazno</div><div class="date">29th April 2001, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah .. LOL, but i think justin won't make a splash.exe :)<br />
<br />
well, your 86 kb are quite ok, did you compile it with delphi 3 ?<br />
<br />
i first compiled mine with D4 and it took 107 kb, then i decided to let a friend do it with c++ builder and voila 25 kb, after upx it was 10,5 kb.<br />
<br />
i did it with gif and jpg support too, but i thought it was to huge. gif gave me 50 kb overhead and jpg 80kb. so i decided to just use the bmp feature.<br />
<br />
i think it is the same to use a 10 kb .exe and a 150 kb .bmp, or a 150 kb .exe and a 10 kb .jpg<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nIRV</div><div class="date">29th April 2001, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">yazno, splash.exe from justin is included in the lastest version (1.4)<br />
<br />
yeah, I compiled it with delphi 3... I was wondering, does the size of compiled apps with higher version of delphi get smaller? with d3 I first had 200k then reduced down to 192 k by removing unused bpl stuff and upx'ed it but god, 192k is huge, delphi must throw tons of unused stuff there ... <br />
<br />
peace<br />

<br />
&gt; yazno, splash.exe from justin is included in the lastest<br />
&gt; version (1.4) <br />
<br />
oops, i haven't seen the new version when i posted my last article.<br />
<br />
he bet me with 3,5 kb, thats fine, i think cause it is pure c, although i find its parameters are too complicated.<br />
<br />
&gt; I was wondering, does the size of compiled apps with <br />
&gt; higher version of delphi get smaller?<br />
<br />
no, the size gets higher with each version. it is because of the growing vcl and the 'forms' unit.<br />

 wow... with delphi 5, the same project is 100k bigger<br />
<br />
 d3: exe = 192 ... upx'ed = 86<br />
 d5: exe = 292 ... upx'ed = 136<br />
<br />
 is there any way to reduce the size... like throwing unused vcl stuff out of the exe?<br />
<br />
 is there any reason why I should move from d3 to d5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yazno</div><div class="date">30th April 2001, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
<br />
yeah, the sizes are hardcore, i neither like it.<br />
<br />
AFAIK it is not possible to make the exesize smaller, except you remove the runtime packages and ship them seperately (then you have almost the same effect like you know from visual basic programs) or you don't use the forms unit and work with dialogs which are compiled as a resource, not to mention the posibility to write 32 bit console applications.<br />
<br />
well d3 and d5 are the most used apps of the delphi series.<br />
there are many enhancements.<br />
<br />
e.g dynamic arrays (as only known from visual basic before) (d4), method overloading (d4), anchors (d4), database enhancements (d4), actixe x data objects (d5), further vcl and ide enhancements and many many more i can't put here ;)<br />
<br />
it's your choice.<br />
