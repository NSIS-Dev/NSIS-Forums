<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ronca</div><div class="date">11th March 2009, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">In my install script I am trying to create a new value in the following registry key:<br />
<br />
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br />
<br />
This value never gets written. :( <br />
<br />
Using regedit, I checked permissions for this key (XP, both SP2 and SP3) - sure enough the key is ready-only.<br />
<br />
Read-only for HKCU ???<br />
<br />
What gives?<br />
<br />
I thought that HKCU are supposed to be writable by the current user (CU) regardless whether he is LUA or has admin privileges?<br />
<br />
Did I miss something?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ron</div></div><hr />

yeah, I hate that key.Is it only that key? Are there other &quot;HKCU&quot; keys that I should be watching for?<br />
<br />
I searched the entire Google &amp; Yahoo regarding this key and there is not a single hint about its trickiness.<br />
<br />
By now I know it's not an NSIS subject per-se but the only way I came across this anomaly was by using NSIS. Maybe this information can help other NSIS programmers who don't understand why their script doesn't work. :eek:</div></div><hr />
