I need some help<br />
Let me explain my problem :<br />
I need to copy a folder and all files included.<br />
The problem is, I don't want to compile a modified .nsi each time. So I'd like to put the folder uncompressed or compressed in fact next to the installation program and then make NSIS copy it while the installation is executed.<br />
<br />
So here is the structure of the CD I wish to send to my associates :<br />
&gt;Root<br />
&gt;&gt;Setup.exe<br />
&gt;&gt;$folder_with_different_name_each_time<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;Files_in_that_folder<br />
<br />
<br />
So you see, the problem is I keep the same .exe and make it install different files.<br />
I could I do that?   <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The only question is about that &quot;folder_with_different_name_each_time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some kind of search&amp;copy loop needs to be coded, either to  search for any folders (if name doesn't matter because you need to copy all folders or there's only 1 folder) or for folders named with some kind of mask (if part of that &quot;different name&quot; is constant, like &quot;bla_xxx&quot;)<br />
<br />
Attached script with a function that copies all folders from  some path to $INSTDIR.</div></div><hr />

Then, you could use your exported list in combination with makecab, either to create one or more cabs, or nsis header to include with your installation the way you like, either one big stub, or uncompressed to their proper location using CopyFiles.</div></div><hr />
