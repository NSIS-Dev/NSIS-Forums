<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rixor</div><div class="date">8th July 2009, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple of installer scripts (actually, 4) that share a lot of common features, functions and settings, and as such, I created a common include file to contain all said commonailites. I don't know if its relevant or not, but I used to have each installer script have everything within it, which was a pain to maintain, but at least it worked.<br />
<br />
The problem: During compilation, when parsing the common header file, the compiler is complaining about a couple of multiply defined symbols, but there is no where that these symbols are defined before hand. Perhaps there is some implications that I am unaware of when splitting up an installer over multiple files.<br />
<br />
Anyways, here is the code:<br />
<br />
Common header file: http://pastebin.com/m1ceacc50<br />
One of the 4 scripts: http://pastebin.com/m36a79415<br />
<br />
The compiler first complains when it reaches line 35 of the common header file. It says that MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP is already defined. If I comment out that line or put !ifndef !endif around it, it then complains about MUI_UNWELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP, and then MUI_ICON, and MUI_UNICON, and a few others beyond that.<br />
<br />
I can't figure this out. It's probably something really stupid, but sometimes you need a fresh pair of eyes to see it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Even if I check the log and look for the !define statement of the apparently already defined symbol, I only find the one instance that it errors on. If the symbol was defined before, should it not show up in the log?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rixor</div><div class="date">9th July 2009, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice, Afrow, I just tried it. It managed to not error on MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP and MUI_UNWELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP, but it did on MUI_ICON. So it may a little bit of a difference, but didn't quite fix the problem. Curious!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rixor</div><div class="date">9th July 2009, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I should mention i am using the latest NSIS with the latest UNICODE branch (downloaded and installed today).<br />
<br />
Also, I tried putting !undef in front of all the macros that have the problem. The installer completes, but the welcome page is blank. This is when using MUI2.nsh.<br />
<br />
With MUI.nsh, the installer gets to the end, but stops with this error:<br />
<br />
Processed 1 file, writing output: Adding plug-ins initializing function... Done! Error: resolving uninstall function &quot;un.Nsis2Io&quot; in function &quot;un.mui.WelcomePre_92.7.5.9&quot; Note: uninstall functions must begin with &quot;un.&quot;, and install functions must not Error - aborting creation process</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rixor</div><div class="date">10th July 2009, 01:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I managed to get almost everything to work, simply by placing the section (not installer section, but rather code section, separated by large comment blocks) titled &quot;setup&quot; after my page definitions. The only problem now is that my header image won't load. It always did with MUI, but MUI2 doesn't seem to want to load it.</div></div><hr />
