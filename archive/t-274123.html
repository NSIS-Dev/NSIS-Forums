<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PGJ</div><div class="date">9th July 2007, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello guys,<br />
on the internet I found this gread installer NSIS. Though it is a bit complex, so I used HM Nis Edit.<br />
<br />
But I cannot find a good script for removing / uninstalling my components! With my Installation I can install 5 components and one is always required (cannot be turnt &quot;off&quot;). But after installting and trying to uninstall it, I'm not able to deselect my installed components, just the hole installed pack.<br />
<br />
So do you guys know an Editor or a Wizard which features this option to create an uninstaller of the components.<br />
<br />
I am thankful for any answers, recommendations or tips.</div></div><hr />

Remember that uninstall sections/functions need the UN. prefix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I have two other questions:<br />
1. How can I delete a shortcut folder in my start menu (I used RMDIR und RMDIR /r, but NSIS deleted my entire start menu!)? <br />
I tried to delete all shortcuts in it, but the shortcuts won't be uninstalled and the folder remains in the menu.<br />
2. In the uninstaller I want to create an dependancy of sections. If I select the first section, the other three should be selected / included too (maby shaded with gray so that you cannot untick them). How can I manage this? Do I have to use the command onSelChange?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Yes, you have to handle this in .onSelChange using the macros provided in Sections.nsh.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PGJ</div><div class="date">10th July 2007, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a little problem:<br />
The .onSelChange should only be used in the uninstaller and not in the installer, because I want to make a section in the uninstaller called &quot;delete all&quot; with which you just tick all the other sections.<br />
<br />
But the problem is: I cannot include the function onselchange into the section of my &quot;delete all&quot; component, because you cannot put a function into that section!<br />
<br />
How can I manage it to get onselchange into the uninstaller?</div></div><hr />
