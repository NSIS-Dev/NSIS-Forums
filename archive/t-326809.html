<br />
I'm new in using NSIS to create a installer. I started with some tutorials and it worked fine. So I decided to use NSIS for my further projects to create a installer. The first projects where plain projects, just copy some files and thats it. <br />
<br />
Now I have a project with a client and a server application. Only one application should be installed. Therefore I created a &quot;components page&quot; with 2 insttypes. Afterwards I defined the sections for each. That works fine.<br />
My problem is in the uninstall section. Here I try to delete the regkeys and startmenu files. The uninstall regkeys are deleted also the files on the harddrive. The problem is the regkey in the &quot;run&quot; environment of the registry and all startmenu files. <br />
After looking through the search I found the solution with &quot;RequestExecutionLevel user&quot;. I tried it but it didn't worked. <br />
<br />
I attached the complete file, so if someone can help me I will appreciate this!<br />

This solves half of my problem. Now it deletes all startmenu entries. But the registry entry for autorun is still not deleted. Mayb there is some other problem. <br />
Beside the &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot; I added a part to check if the user is really a admin in the .onInit function. I added the enhanced code here.<br />

Very good, that's indeed a necessary step.<br />
<br />
As for your problem, you write a regstr and try to delete a regkey. You should use DeleteRegValue, not DeleteRegKey.</div></div><hr />
