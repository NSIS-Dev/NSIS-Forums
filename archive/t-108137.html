<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">3rd October 2002, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">as some of you may know, i wrote a gui for NSIS a while back.  it was relatively successful during its peak, but then it kinda died out.  most of the feedback i recieved told me that it was overkill, or that the wizard was the really useful part of the program.<br />
<br />
i thought about that, and about 3-4 hours ago started writing a new, smaller and faster wizard for NSIS.  just input your info and go.<br />

<br />
there is the link.  download or not, no skin off my back :)  if you do, however, let me know what you think.  it may be a tad outdated, so tell me what i can add to bring it up to speed with the latest NSIS build.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">R@m00n</div><div class="date">3rd October 2002, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to look good, but you need to make some changes:<br />
 - Gradient color should be set in a color selection dialog.<br />
 - File should be added also by dragging them into the window<br />
 - If I select &quot;Cancel&quot; in the Finsih-dialog it saves the file to the default filename, but it should cancel<br />
 - Filename selection in OpenDialog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdbarker</div><div class="date">3rd October 2002, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, in the file selection list, the ability to add different sections, and to move files up/down through it.<br />
<br />
Ascii Example:<br />
[Main]<br />
C:\File1.txt<br />
C:\File1.exe<br />
[Optional]<br />
E:\File2.txt<br />
[Optional 1]<br />
E:\File3.txt<br />
<br />
If you get what I'm saying.  I think that would help the users more.  (I do all my coding in vim though, so, I'm not sure.  :))<br />
