<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnezz</div><div class="date">7th November 2009, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I get this message in a pop up window whenever I try to install Dragon Age, which uses the NSIS 2.34 installer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad Start Menu value. Too short.&quot; <br />
<br />
It happens during the &quot;Select a Start Menu folder:&quot; window, right after I click &quot;Next &gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm almost certain it's because I try to install the application sandboxed, as I do with almost all my apps, to avoid any leftover clutter after I remove it later. I use Sandboxie for this.<br />
<br />
My question is what the error message above actually means. I've tried giving the installer full access to the start menu paths but get the same message. I've tried a variety of names and had no success either.<br />
<br />
I've searched with google and also used the various searches here and in the wiki and found nothing about the error. If I knew what exactly it means and why it's generated, I might be able to come up with a workaround.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnezz</div><div class="date">7th November 2009, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the first time I've seen that message and I've installed various applications and games hundreds of times now.<br />
Granted, it might be they customized the installer script, so it's non standard.<br />
<br />
I also get the error even if I elect to have no start menu created.<br />
<br />
If anyone can confirm whether the error message above is actually part of NSIS or not, it would be a big step forward :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">7th November 2009, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">You said you used Sandboxie, that really alters the way windows works so you might want to give it a go without it.<br />
<br />
As far as figuring out if the installer has customized stuff, there is not much you can do. You can check in %temp%\ns???? while the installer is running to see a list of plugins used, but no real way to check the inner workings of the installer if they have some sort of path checking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnezz</div><div class="date">8th November 2009, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the temp directories and there were indeed several plugins used. Unfortunately I have no real expereience with them so it does me little good.<br />
<br />
Thank you anyway for your help :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I upgraded to the latest version of sandboxie and installed without a hitch. I don't know if it's the upgrade that did it or some other factor, but at least everything works now.</div></div><hr />
