<br />
I have a problem with RegDLL<br />
<br />
It doesn't work if I call it juste after copying the dll I want to register. This code doesn't work (the dll is not registered):<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
File &quot;test.dll&quot;<br />
RegDLL &quot;$INSTDIR\test.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
In fact, I have to register my dlls after copying all files.<br />
I suppose that the command RegDLL is executed before the file has been compeletely copied.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to correct this behaviour? In fact, is it possible to create a synchronous copy of the files? Like this, the RegDLL would be launched only if the file has been compeletely copied.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">That DLL probably depends on some other DLLs that are copied after the RegDLL instruction. Make sure you extract all its dependencies before you try to register it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'll try to explain how I would do this:<br />
<br />
Copy all of your files(dlls AND other stuff) where you want them to be. After all sections which copy files, you open a section which has just to register the dlls<br />
<br />
like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Section &quot;copy dlls&quot;<br />
   SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
   File &quot;test.dll&quot;<br />
   File &quot;other.dll&quot;<br />
   File &quot;your.dll&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;register dlls&quot;<br />
   RegDLL &quot;$INSTDIR\test.dll&quot;<br />
   RegDLL &quot;$INSTDIR\other.dll&quot;<br />
   RegDLL &quot;$INSTDIR\your.dll&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I think this should work<br />
<br />
so long -L-B-</div></div><hr />

You're right!<br />
I tried to register the xerces dll without having copy the 2 other dll needed by the first one!</div></div><hr />
