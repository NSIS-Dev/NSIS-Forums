<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">28th June 2003, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">In designing an INI its pretty easy and straightforward to add keyboard acceleration to labels. But how to add them to the actual fields?<br />
<br />
I am sort of stumped in trying to make the &quot;&amp;Field One&quot; field catch focus when a user presses Alt+F. I have about 9 fields and all labels are marked but the fields are not and present a problem in trying to accelerate.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me with an idea? Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">29th June 2003, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If the label is Field 5 then the text field should be Field 6. They should probably be in a group too, but I honestly don't know enough about this and don't have the time to check right now. I am sure MSDN will have more to say about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so in order to get keyboard acceleration going I must look into the INI and not into the NSIS script, correct?<br />
<br />
Thank you Kichik for all of your help on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it's all in the INI file. Most of InstallOptions options are in the INI file. All but setting colors and anything that requires NSIS code is there.<br />
<br />
Thank you Kichik for all of your help on these boards.<br />
<br />
No problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I've given rest on this subject for a minute but tried feverishly again to get it to work... I guess you all know whats coming...<br />
<br />
I tried Grouping like this &quot;Flags=GROUP ONE&quot;. I applied this to the text field which has the &quot;&amp;Key&quot; and selected the matching field. This doesn't work...<br />
<br />
I tried applying the &quot;&amp;Key&quot; into the fields text field. This also doesn't work...<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to keyboard accelerate across fields and could be cool enough to tell me I would definitely appreciate it. I am not that sharp and I tried a few more things but I am getting it wrong.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The GROUP flag doesn't work this way. Every field that has the GROUP flag will have the following fields in his group until the next field with a GROUP. It seems as just putting the text field right after the label field is enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Kichik,<br />
<br />
Are the INI files documented? I went into all the INI files that come bundled with NSIS and none have the acceleration but some were using flags HM NIS EDIT doesn't provide.<br />
<br />
Is their any place where I can learn more about group and other flags?<br />
<br />
Thank you Kichik :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The possible INI values are documented in the InstallOptions readme. You can find it in Contrib\InstallOptions\Readme.html.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Kichik,<br />
<br />
It is not documented and I scanned it twice to make sure :( It is probably a hidden or unimplemented or undocumented feature... I can mark labels with the &quot;&amp;&quot; but cannot do so to fields... I do not know what left to do about it except knock it way down on the priority list.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows of a workaround to help in keyboard acceleration across fields I am all ears. Thank you for your help Kichik, indeed valuable on the forums :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any more feedback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">GROUP is documented, it's under Flags. As for the keyboard acceleration, I said in my first reply that I don't know enough about it, so it's not documented.<br />
<br />
Attached is an example INI file to what I have said in my first reply. It works for me. Notice fields 7 and 8. It doesn't work if you reverse the order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Kichik,<br />
<br />
This has certainly saved my day! Thank you so much for this priceless information as now I have accelerated all screens. Perhaps add this bit to the next install options readme.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much again Kichik :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th July 2003, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">According to what I have read so far, there is nothing more to it. Just group them and the tab should work as long as the label doesn't have WS_TABSTOP. But don't worry, InstallOptions handles the WS_TABSTOP part.</div></div><hr />
