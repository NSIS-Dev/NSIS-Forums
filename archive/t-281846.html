<br />
I was having so many troubles reading the exit codes from my batch scripts that I decided to go a different way.  I changed the scripts so they now make a dummy text file (using echo and redirect &quot;&gt;&quot;) if they ran successfully and don't make the file if they had an error.  In the installer / uninstaller I want to just test for the presence of the file.<br />
<br />
The scripts will create the files fine when I run them from the command line but don't create the file when I call them from the installer.  Anybody have any thoughts about why this is happening?  Or suggestions to get the files written.  I am not an expert in either batch or NSIS so there could be any number of things wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It's the only process that parses input/output redirection. When normally creating processes on Windows with CreateProcess, those won't work and will be considered part of the arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fightin_Foo</div><div class="date">23rd November 2007, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed the scripts from .bat to .cmd to ensure they were run with cmd.exe, and I am using ExecWait to call the scripts so I think I am avoiding the CreateProcess problems that occur with !execute and !system.  Is there something else that I am missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd November 2007, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">!execute and !system are compile time commands. They won't cause the script to run on the user's system.</div></div><hr />
