<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johnm312</div><div class="date">7th April 2009, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">After searching around and looking all over, I am stuck..<br />
<br />
I have a simple installer that basicly is downloading files from the web and copying files from one folder/cd to another basied on various ini and XML files. <br />
<br />
This can be a long process and the cancel button is disabled for all of this. <br />
<br />
I want to enable the cancel button during any of this. I got to the point that if i cancel a download, it will pop a box that i canceled with &quot;do I wish to continue&quot;. <br />
<br />
But, for the file copy portion, the user is stuck waiting for 1000's of files to copy. and is forced to 3finger salute it. <br />
<br />
Am I overlooking an obvious feature to abort? <br />
<br />
I do not need a call back or unistall of what they have installed to this point. in fact it is prefered that it stays  where it is since my script does a CRC check of files I have installed to this point and resumes or copies new/changed file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I swear i tried that... <br />
<br />
I must have had a typo.<br />
<br />
Thanks. <br />
<br />
I pasted that example into the the script. It works like a charm. <br />
<br />
It did leave a few a few random temp files in the folder and i forgot that i need to unload the UAC function. It looks like .onUserAbort cleans all of that up nicely...<br />
<br />
Thanks again. You saved me from going bald ripping my hair out.</div></div><hr />
