<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zip_doo_dah</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like my installer to go to a directory of images and change the names of the files so that all the characters in the file name are lower case.  I haven't been able to find a toUpperCase or toLowerCase function.  How does one do this?<br />
<br />
The new server we are moving to is case sensitive and the present files could be upper case, lower case, or mixed.  I need these files to be consistent and so I would like them to be entirely lower case.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I did a search in the NSIS archive and guess what appeared, not 1 but 5 examples. Here's the StrLower (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=152) function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zip_doo_dah</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Sweet!  Thank you so much.  I tried searching on the words change case lower and upper in a bunch of combinations to no avail.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Were you searching the forum or the archive? I did a search in the archive for the word &quot;lower&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">a nice feature for archive pages would be keywords, like meta-tags for html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">What would be a neat feature is a post that resides at the top of the forum that contains an index of links which fully represent the archive names in real time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhhnn, remember StrFunc.nsh (inside Include subdir)? That one that has the command ${StrCase} which changes strings into Lower Case, Upper Case, Title Case and Sentence Case?<br />
<br />
To do that command I had to start from those functions you saw in Archive. So thanks Archive members for everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I haven't ever used that deguix. I didn't even know it existed....coool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Nor I did about LogicLib.nsh! Sometimes you just don't want to know what possibilities are there.<br />
<br />
(Hmmm... donuts. Ahhnhrnrnn....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">My buddy Don (DSelkirk) made the logic lib. I did most of the C side of the Service Library, because I had it implemented in another app, then he ported it so it would work in NSIS. Lots of interesting features that are scattered all over.<br />
<br />
I want to update my FileInfo plugin to acquire file sizes and attributes, but I haven't gotten around to yet.</div></div><hr />
