<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">todd_ingr</div><div class="date">24th May 2006, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having a bit of trouble getting install types working the way I'd like them to.  <br />
<br />
I am creating an installer containing map files for two separate products, I'll call them A and B.  The installer checks for the existence of the products and changes the components page accordingly.  This works great as is.  So if the installer detects A and B, they're both on the components page.  If only one is found, just that product is listed.  <br />
<br />
The problem is introduced when I try to create install types.    I have defined two install types (Day and Night) to allow the user to install the appropriate version of the maps.  However, if product A is not installed, installer will continue to install the files associated with that product. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the script will help illustrate my problem.  I would like for my installer to do the following:<br />
<br />
1) Check for required software and populate the components correctly (this works)<br />
<br />
2) Have install types that don't install unnecessary components!  (this fails miserably!)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JasonFriday13</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 01:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a simple approach to this is to use an installoptions page that has the components on it, and then check the value in the section. I have made some modifications to the script to show this. I have made the sections into one, and checked the value and decided which .map file to install.<br />
<br />
I realise this is not an answer to you question, it's just a suggestion on other ways to get rid of the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was actually thinking of doing what you've suggested and using an InstallOptions page.  <br />
<br />
After incorporating the installoptions and tweaking my validation function, I was able to get it working.  <br />
<br />
Now I just need to set the page header and top text, if it's possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
