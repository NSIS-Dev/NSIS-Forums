<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">motion157</div><div class="date">9th October 2002, 22:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if anyone knew of a plugin that can download files from the installer over the internet.  For example, depending upon which components they've chosen, the installer can go and grab additional files from a website.<br />
<br />
To me, this isn't the best way to do an installer, however, my company wants a lightweight installer that doesn't include a JRE.  It will detect if someone has the java plugin installed.  If they don't have the plugin, it will ask them if they'd like to download and install it.  I have a feeling the best/easiest way is just to tell them where to go download it.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

I know how to make it download the java plugin...I just don't know how to make it only download it if it's not installed on someones computer.  How would I go about doing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 04:50</div></div><div class="posttext">First you would have to detect if JRE is installed, there is an Archive page on that subject I think.  Then if not installed call the NSIS-DL plugin otherwise skip it.<br />
