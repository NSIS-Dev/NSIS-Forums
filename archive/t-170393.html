<br />
I've seen a number of utilities for editing files, but none have been exactly what I wanted. Can anyone recommend the easiest way to insert new lines into a text file?<br />
<br />
Ideally, I need to be able to do a find to locate the position where I want to insert (this worked fine), then insert the line. The filewrite commands seem to overwrite whatever is in the file at the location, rather than inserting there. Other things I found all wanted to replace something that was already there.<br />
<br />
Did I miss something?<br />
<br />
Recommendations?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Stan</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Create a new file.<br />
2) Get text from the old and write in the new file. Repeat for every char on the file.<br />
3) When a text you want to insert is found, insert the text found in the new file with the new text. Go to Step 2.<br />
<br />
The problem is, besides problems writing text, have problems reading it too: if you get a null character, sets an error, because the command thinks it is the end of the file.</div></div><hr />
