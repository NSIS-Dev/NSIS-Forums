<br />
What i want to do is be able to choose whether a section in the components page should be required or not based on a condition.<br />
<br />
I can't put the section block inside an if statement and i couldn't find a way to change the state of a component from normal to required (and vice-versa) from within a function.<br />
<br />
Could someone propose a solution or at least point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Probably in function .onInit I would check the condition's true/false state and regarding to that I would set sections in the required state either with sections management instructions or (preferable) with sections.nsh offered commands.<br />
