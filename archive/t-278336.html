<br />
I've almost completed my first script; I'm just stuck on the actual main part, which is the installation of the actual files. <br />
<br />
My installer can install two components; one is mandatory, one is optional. Both sections would copy a single directory (plus all subdirs/files) to the same $OUTDIR.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that single directory are different forms of the same directory, which is where I got stuck. Let's say it's called Dir1, with 2 versions; a basic one and an advanced one (with extra subdirs/files). <br />
<br />
So I set up the following dir structure in the same folder as my script:<br />
<br />
script.nsi<br />
basic/<br />
    Dir1<br />
enhanced<br />
    Dir1<br />
<br />
... and I tried the following lines:<br />
<br />
File /r basic/Dir1<br />
<br />
File /r enhanced/Dir1<br />
<br />
That didn't work.<br />
<br />
The following line _does_ work:<br />
<br />
File /r Dir1<br />
<br />
But I can't use this since it would in my source directory where my script is, I can only have one form of Dir1 in there at at a time.<br />
<br />
I realise I could set up multiple &quot;File&quot; lines copying each subdir in turn, but there's a _lot_ and I wanted to make the script as simple as possible as someone else will be maintaining it.<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated,<br />
<br />
P.</div></div><hr />
