<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spanky</div><div class="date">17th April 2001, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I think having a &quot;Web Install&quot; option would be 'gnarly'<br />
<br />
Instead of packaging all the files into 1 exe why not download an installer (like Netscape's setup) that transfers the necessary files from the web?<br />
<br />
Maybe even have the option to store a text file on a specified server and have the installer download that file first.. this file would contain the filenames (and locations) of what to download.<br />
This way people would use the installer as an updater too.<br />
<br />
Excuse me if I come across as confusing.  I am a bit drunk at the moment.  =)</div></div><hr />

Bor.<br />
<br />
PS. My best ideas also come when I'm drunk, the only problem is remembering them the next morning. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it's probably a lot of work (you'd need to include a complete downloader).<br />
Do you want such a complex (and error-prone) feature?</div></div><hr />

Nobody can mirror your files if the install script always looks in the same place - and what if you change web hosts?  Ugh.<br />

<br />
Or you could do what I've done, and test for the VB runtime files and re-direct the user to download something else if they don't exist:<br />
<br />
  IfFileExists &quot;$SYSDIR\msvbvm60.dll&quot; 0 5<br />
  IfFileExists &quot;$SYSDIR\mscomctl.ocx&quot; 0 4<br />
  IfFileExists &quot;$SYSDIR\mscomct2.ocx&quot; 0 3<br />
  IfFileExists &quot;$SYSDIR\comdlg32.ocx&quot; 0 2<br />
  IfFileExists &quot;$SYSDIR\tabctl32.ocx&quot; 0 1<br />
  Jump 2<br />
  MessageBox MB_YESNO &quot;You are missing support files.  Download them now?&quot; IDNO 1<br />
  ExecShell &quot;&quot; &quot;http://path.to/download/vbruntime.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Nifty, eh? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carlito_au</div><div class="date">18th April 2001, 03:25</div></div><div class="posttext">this is what i did in a .vbs file that my nsis script runs:<br />
<br />
Dim fso<br />
Set fso = CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;)<br />
If not fso.FileExists(&quot;C:\Windows\System\ASYCFILT.DLL&quot;) then<br />
msgbox &quot;The file ASYCFILT.DLL can't be found.&quot;, 64<br />
end if<br />
If not fso.FileExists(&quot;C:\Windows\System\COMCAT.DLL&quot;) then<br />
msgbox &quot;The file COMCAT.DLL can't be found.&quot;, 64<br />
end if<br />
If not fso.FileExists(&quot;C:\Windows\System\MSVBVM60.DLL&quot;) then<br />
msgbox &quot;The VB6 runtime files can't be found.&quot;, 64<br />
end if<br />
If not fso.FileExists(&quot;C:\Windows\System\OLEAUT32.DLL&quot;) then<br />
msgbox &quot;The file OLEAUT32.DLL can't be found.&quot;, 64<br />

msgbox &quot;The file Olepro32.DLL can't be found.&quot;, 64<br />
end if<br />
msgbox &quot;If this is the first message box you've seen then<br />
 you're all set and ready to use the program. If any file <br />
was reported missing then you'll need to install the VB6 <br />
runtime files.&quot;, 64</div></div><hr />

I knew this would happen.  Sorry I didn't get to you sooner in the thread.  Just wanted to warn you that posting while drunk is NEVAR a good idea!  You will always do something silly!  Or i always do!*<br />
