<br />
I have a very large set of learning videos and mp3 files to be installed(fairly speaking to be copied in specific directory order) along with our custom player.<br />
The normal installer is ready now and the compiled size is 2.7GB (monster but fits into a DVD).<br />
<br />
The problem here is during the installation the next button is disabled and user can not cancel the setup. I want the setup to be able to cancel the installation process and rollback(preferablly with the progressbar in the reverse oredr like it does with MS Office setup).<br />
<br />
I also want the uninstall process be with the same functionality.<br />
<br />
A prime thaught was of moving the things to temp one by one and on final screen delete it but it would take too long to perform the task.<br />
<br />
Any ideas guys? Any new hot feature or pulgin?</div></div><hr />

However, some plug-ins might help you achieve that. CABSetup (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/CABSetup_plug-in) recently got cancellation ability.</div></div><hr />

:)<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
