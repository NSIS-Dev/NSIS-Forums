<br />
I am here to tell you about the full functional site for the NSIS Project House. As I am no longer is school (Summer break), I have been working hard on some php coding. So much that I have set an completion date. The Day will be September 27, 2 Months and 1 day from this post. The Reason for this is that I have been comfortable with my coding and trusting the SourceForge Interface. I am still accepting projects, NSI scripts, and some HowTos. <br />
<br />
I have however disabled the mailing lists for the project. I felt that they were taking up space and that I wanted to make it an extention of this community.<br />
<br />
As the site completion date draws closer, you will see more items accessable to you. Currently, I am working on the following:<br />
<br />
1) Scripts Depot (Users can submit scripts to the site) 75% Done<br />
2)User login/Control Panel (Users can add a new project or request a removal of a project) 25% done<br />
3)Admin Control Panel 95% done<br />
<br />
I plan to add a news script (Users can submit news to be posted on main page) and a Project Directory Listing.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, submissions or comments, email me at duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net .<br />
