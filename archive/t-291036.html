<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anach</div><div class="date">29th April 2008, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello. I've been playing around with different ways to handle a couple options, but before I try to work out how to go about it or spend time trying to research something that's not possible., I have a couple questions. <br />
<br />
Currently  i'm using !define MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_FUNCTION to display a second readme checkbox on the finish page. First question. Is it possible to add more checkboxes to the finish page (4-5), or will I need to make a custom finish page?<br />
<br />
Id like to have. <br />
<br />
Show readme<br />
Show Changelog<br />
Show help file<br />
Check for updates on windows start<br />
<br />
<br />
On the same note, is it possible to add multiple checkboxs to the welcome page?<br />
<br />
The reason I would like multiple checkboxs on the Welcome page is that my installer will often need to be installed twice, to two separate directories, and I'm trying to work out a way to change the stored registry settings and the default install path from Dir1/install to Dir2/Install with a user selecting that check box.<br />
eg.<br />
Check to install to dir1<br />
Check to install to dir2<br />
Check to save install options.<br />
<br />
I could do this with a popup box, but I already have too many of those for install checks, update checks and remembering components (which i'd prefer to add to the start page). I also wanted to avoid adding a new page just to select between the two directory settings, as I believe there are already too many pages to click through.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please forgive any spelling errors, as I just got a new keyboard and it's taking a while to get used to :P</div></div><hr />
