<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">30th May 2006, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">odd one, When I specify a variable to be used for an Outfile name, it doesnt preserve the caps.<br />
<br />
example, <br />
<br />
I have a var called $blech which contains BLECH<br />
<br />
if I do <br />
<br />
Outfile &quot;Setup $blech.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
I get, as a resulting filename:<br />
<br />
&quot;Setup blech.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
and not <br />
<br />
&quot;Setup BLECH.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
of course, this works fine<br />
<br />
Outfile &quot;Setup BLECH.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
returns<br />
<br />
&quot;Setup BLECH.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
am I being stupid? its just I need the company brand to be in capitals. of course hardcoding it myself works, but that negates the whole point of the variable substitution.<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

OutFile is a compile-time instruction - it writes the setup file onto your computer. Variables such as $blech are for run time use... i.e. when the setup is run on the users' computer.<br />
Naturally you can't use a run time variable at compile time - this is impossible!<br />
<br />
Why is it coming out as blech.exe? Well it's taking the $blech variable and trimming the $ from the front (invalid path character) and using that as the file name.<br />

<br />
<br />
I dont think so, this was merely an example and I have no $blech variable with BLECH contained, so it can't be just chopping the dollar off.<br />
<br />
Its a define actually, and not a variable if that makes any difference.</div></div><hr />

!defines use curly braces -&gt; ${blech}<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">30th May 2006, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah sorry about that, only noticed after, yeah it does use braces, definately a define.<br />
<br />
I can't explain how it just switched from not being uppercase, to being uppercase though. I havent changed it myself.<br />
<br />
its the same code as when I posted this thread.<br />
<br />
world. .. ignore me<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">30th May 2006, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Never mind then lol<br />
<br />
$ isn't an invalid path character either :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">30th May 2006, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">true, I'm lost now, hah<br />
<br />
anyway whats important is that it works.<br />
<br />
you're saying its just chopping the dollar off right?<br />
<br />
so if its a define, where do the curly braces go?<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure its not just dumping the define name or dropping the $ or whatever.<br />
<br />
ah well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">30th May 2006, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">No it isn't.<br />
I'm not sure what was wrong really with the details that you gave (mind you they were more unhelpful really!)<br />
<br />
!define MyDefine &quot;blah&quot;<br />
OutFile &quot;${MyDefine}.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
-Stu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaunb</div><div class="date">30th May 2006, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, my example was .. ... -=useless=-<br />
<br />
sorry about that hah<br />
<br />
The example you show there, thats the code I had before, when I made this thread,.. I changed it so it was hardcoded, obviously it worked then, but wasnt suitable, so I added the define again, and now its working with caps. weird.<br />
<br />
anyway, now I've made myself appear a complete lemon to everyone I'd better continue with my project.. .. lol<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />
