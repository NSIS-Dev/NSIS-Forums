<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grömlin</div><div class="date">10th April 2011, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">My installer won't start on Windows Vista 32bit. (I've tested it on Windows XP 32bit and Windows 7 64bit, there it works.) It fails with the message &quot;The NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction. *some strange numbers* Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.&quot; It's possible to click on &quot;Ignore&quot; also, but the result is the same.<br />
<br />
I don't have this problem myself, another one has downloaded my installer and even that three times. I've downloaded it also just to be sure that the installer is not corrupted but it isn't.<br />
<br />
I've googled a little bit and found some sites where they say that this could be virus/trojan related problem. (On the users operating system, of course :rolleyes: ) But is that the only possibility?</div></div><hr />

I gave the user a direct link to the file and it has worked. (There seems to be a problem with some browsers and my website...)</div></div><hr />
