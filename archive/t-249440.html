<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">littlerob</div><div class="date">23rd June 2006, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">You may all know this already, but I had some problems with my PC and had to restore to an earlier system restore point. In doing so I lost changes I'd made to a .nsi script, and an entire script, because, for reasons known only to MS, it includes .NSI files in the system restore.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried to specifically exclude them, but there is a file<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\Restore\filelist.xml where this can be done.<br />
<br />
NOTE<br />
Despite what it says, system Restore did a pretty good job of messing up my PC:<br />
<br />
a) directories that I'd created and renamed were gone.<br />
b) NSI files were gone<br />
c) MSI files that i'd created (from merge modules) were gone<br />
d) INI files that my code uses were gone.<br />
<br />
I've now turned it off on my D: drive, and suggest you all do the same.<br />
