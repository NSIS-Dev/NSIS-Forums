<br />
How can I check if some file is currently in use?<br />
<br />
I mean if for example its EXE file then I can check using proceses if its running or not, but what if this is some TXT file that is simply open (lets say a user opened it in Notepad) how can I know that its open ?</div></div><hr />

ClearErrors<br />
FileOpen $R0 &quot;C:\file.txt&quot; w<br />
${If} ${Errors}<br />
 # File is locked.<br />
${Else}<br />
 FileClose $R0<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
If you want to know what program is locking the file, use the LockedList plug-in (Windows NT4+ only).<br />

And if this is a binary file like EXE or DLL will this work? I mean if I open and close binary file it stays as it was and not been damaged or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">17th July 2007, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Please not that the file could be open for shared write and that the example will not work in those cases</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">is99</div><div class="date">17th July 2007, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that im my case there will be share write, but will it work with binary files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">17th July 2007, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">It should do. To try that, duplicate the code so the installer tries to open the unlocked file twice and the 2nd open should fail.<br />
<br />
The other option is to attempt a rename and then check for errors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">is99</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Something wrong is going on :)<br />
<br />
I took a text file and tried the first option (to open a file for writing), unfortunatly even when this text file was open in Notepad during the run I still got no error in NSIS.<br />
<br />
So I told myself maybe its share writing or something and moved to a second option (to rename a file) and it also shove no error !!!! <br />
Even worst then that what happend is that I had 1.txt file and I asked to rename it to 1.old, I opened this 1.txt in Notepad again and run the NSIS code and again no erorr and it actually created a 1.old file and left the old one too, so basicly it did copy instead of rename <br />
<br />
Any ideas what can be done ?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">When it is open in notepad can you delete/rename/move the file in explorer? I certainly can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">is99</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">First  of all I never tried it till now, and actually it looks a bit strange that I can dlete a file that is currently open.<br />
<br />
But anyway back to my problem, so if non of these options work then how can I check in NSIS that file is currently in use ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can delete a file that notepad has open then notepad probably isn't locking it. If you want to test this theory, try WhoUses.exe:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChesterBr</div><div class="date">4th September 2007, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify, Notepad does not keep a file open. What it does when you open a file is:<br />
<br />
a) Open the file<br />
b) Read all of its contents in memory (swap file will implicitly be used here if file is too big)<br />
c) Close the file, only remembering its local name<br />
<br />
When you are editing the &quot;file&quot; (i.e., the in-memory data), the file can be freely deleted, moved, etc.<br />
<br />
If you save the file, it reopens the file, writes back all data and closes it. If the file is not there anymore, the save becomes a &quot;save as&quot;, prompting you for a new file name.<br />
<br />
So Notepad is not a great tool to check if a file is open. Word (or OpenOffice Write), however, will do the trick, since they keep the file open while editing (even text files).<br />
<br />
Anyway, does anyone has any example checking if a program is open? I would like my uninstaller to make sure the program is closed (or even close it) before uninstalling, otherwise, the program (and its companion DLLs) are not uninstalled.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
I was not able to compile the plug-in due to a missing header file exdll.h<br />
<br />
This file was not included in the zip file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">17th March 2010, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">while looking for a better method to figure out if a file is locked (without using the heavy LockedList function), I stumbled upon this thread which seems to suggest a method I'm currently using as well - and which had a grave error.<br />
<br />
Do -not- use..<br />
<br />
FileOpen $R0 &quot;C:\file.txt&quot; w<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead, use (in lieu of something better)...<br />
<br />
FileOpen $R0 &quot;C:\file.txt&quot; a<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason is that opening a file in -Write- mode will clear its contents if the file opened okay.  So after you have determined that the file is not locked: congratulations, you also killed it :D<br />
Not a problem if you plan on overwriting it anyway - huge potential for problems, though.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as Anders points out, this won't help when the file is open for shared write (probably a rare situation).<br />
In addition, you end up 'touching' the file (changing its last modified timestamp, etc.).<br />
<br />
Just trying to move/rename a file isn't panacea either - I've currently got a file locked ($SYSDIR\someDLL.dll).. I can't open it for append, can't overwrite it ..but I can rename it just fine.<br />
<br />
I suppose one option would be to...<br />
1. make a backup copy<br />
2. try to overwrite the file<br />
3a. restore the backup if the overwrite was successful - file was not locked<br />
3b. delete the backup if the overwrite was unsuccessful - file was locked.<br />
<br />
This, too, seems a bit 'dirty' though.</div></div><hr />
