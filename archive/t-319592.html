<br />
My problem is as follows:<br />
I am using nsPython within my installer and on my own system everthing is fine. On the systems of a few other users everything is working fine, too. But on the system of two users (so far), nothing is fine. And I have no idea why. :(<br />
<br />
It seems so, that NSIS wont load the plugin, because every attempt to use it, ends with.. nothing. Only the given parameters are in the stack, of course.<br />
<br />
I have tried it with the standard way (nsPython::exec &quot;some code&quot;) and with the CallInstDLL-Function linked to the nsPython.dll within the exe-directory. I have tried the possible solutions (without success) mentioned in this thread: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=214088&amp;highlight=nspython<br />
<br />
Now, I am completely lost. The source code of this plugin has been shipped within the downloadable archive, but that wont help me, since I do not understand c.<br />
<br />
The only thing which I recognized, is that the two users where it wont work, are using &quot;Windows 7 Enterprise x64&quot; and &quot;Windows 7 Ultimate x64.&quot; All other users are using something between &quot;Windows XP Home&quot; and &quot;Windows 7 Professional x64&quot; and there it will work.<br />
<br />
Has anyone any idea what could be so special with Win7 Enterprise and Ultimate?<br />
Has anyone noticed a similar problem with nsPython or another plugin?<br />
Has anyone any idea how to fix it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And of course, I could use a python executable but the problem is: My pythoncode has to interact with NSIS. Sure, that could be done with an executable as well, but not as handy as the plugin would do it. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
