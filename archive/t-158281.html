<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinger95</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 04:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw the thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=153677) from october in which soknin talked about a problem with his own dll for setting permissions. I didn't see a download or anything, I'm just wondering how many people have done the same thing with a custom dll.<br />
<br />
I'm also curious about when/if the ability to set permssions on a file/directory will come along with NSIS even if it's a plugin.<br />
<br />
Seeing as people have contributed code to create virtual directories I imagine others find themselves in my situation. I have an web based app using an Access database. After install, you need to manually give the webserver's IUSR account access to the directory and file, which is far from optimal. I am finding myself creating more and more web apps and web app installers, so the lack of permissions capabilities keeps getting more frustrating.<br />
<br />
I don't quite have the C++ expertise to implement a plugin, but I'd like to try to get the people with said expertise together and get permissions capabilities added to NSIS. Currently the other viable option is to switch to using InstallShield to create an .MSI installer that can set the permissions, but then I loose a lot of the flexibility NSIS offers.<br />
<br />
So anyone good with C++ and want to give permissions a shot? Or if you already have something working, post it here.</div></div><hr />

It may be helpful to add a sentence to it's description that includes &quot;NTFS&quot; and &quot;permissions&quot;. Thanks for the pointer.</div></div><hr />
