<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dboy</div><div class="date">26th August 2003, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm kind of new to NSIS and for the installer I'm making, I had to set the executable to Windows 98 compatability mode for the install. Doing that was pretty easy and just required a:<br />
<br />
WriteRegStr HKCU &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\filename.exe&quot; &quot;WIN98 DISABLECICERO&quot;<br />
<br />
However, the problem is the shortcuts to it created by NSIS. When you right click a shortcut, it displays all the proper information in the compatability tab, however when you run it, it results in the crash you get if compatability mode is not set.<br />
<br />
Running the actual EXE in the install folder works perfectly. In fact, if I go to that EXE and click &quot;Create Shortcut,&quot; rename it to the shortcut produced by NSIS, and copy it over the NSIS file, the shortcut now works fine.<br />
<br />
I already scanned the registry for the .lnk to see if there were specific compatability mode settings for it and there don't appear to be.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone a bit more experienced with NSIS might have an idea what I can do about this. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Quick Edit: I already tried adding a registry entry for the .lnk file like I did for the EXE, but that appears to have no effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It turns out it was due to what SetOutPath was set to. After installing all program files, I had to install some windows fonts so I descended into $WINDIR\Fonts.<br />
<br />
This causes all CreateShortcuts to use $WINDIR\Fonts as their &quot;Start In&quot; path which breaks compatibility mode for some quirky reason.<br />
<br />
The fix was to, after installing all files, set SetOutPath pack to $INSTDIR.<br />
<br />
Everything works great now.</div></div><hr />
