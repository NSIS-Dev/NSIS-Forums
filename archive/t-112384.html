<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">1st November 2002, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest to change formats for the name of the function and the section number, because now is difficult to read.<br />
<br />
That's in the makensis.html for the new nsis20b0.<br />
<br />
Here's how it looks now:<br />
<br />
Section 4.3: AutoCloseWindow<br />
Section 4.4: BGGradient<br />
Section 4.5: BrandingText<br />
Section 4.6: Caption<br />
<br />
And what I prefer:<br />
<br />
Section 4.3: AutoCloseWindow<br />
Section 4.4: BGGradient<br />
Section 4.5: BrandingText<br />
Section 4.6: Caption</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">1st November 2002, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, thats a good idea.  We will be updating the documentation generator (Kichik has already made some changes).  This should be rather simple to add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 03:41</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, If I have future suggestions I will post them here.<br />
<br />
And that Docs are very nice.<br />
<br />
And those Icons, too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">3rd November 2002, 03:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I have updated the docs here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/).  I'm still not sure about the colors and such.  Let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
Btw, I tried removing the links to the Section X part of the links.  However, it turned out to be harder to read.  Therefore, the index page removes all references to Section X.  Hopefully, it makes it easier to find commands and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">3rd November 2002, 05:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, now is very easy to read. :up:<br />
<br />
I can even read and scroll at the same time. :cool:<br />
<br />
<br />
While previewing I had another idea: To write below the title &quot;NSIS Users Manual&quot; and above the presentation, the titles of chapters in a row, something like:<br />
<br />
Introduction to NSIS _ _ _ MakeNSIS Usage    Script File Format _ _ _ Installer Attributes _ _ _ Compiler Flags _ _ _ Pages     Sections _ _ _ Basic Instructions _ _ _ Registry, INI, File Instructions _ _ _ General Purpose Instructions _ _ _ Flow Control Instructions . . . . . <br />
<br />
<br />
This will give us a clear idea of what this docs can offer, and will make navigation even easier :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">7th November 2002, 23:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I suggested to add a row with the chapter titles because what's good with having the whole list of commands is that you can ctrl+f to search where is that command you want to know. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">8th November 2002, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">What if you made the chapters expandable. Like Microsoft does at their site. It would become handy when I'm looking for a specific instruction. Now I can't find it in the contents-list and do I have to go through all chapters (or at least the ones with instructions).</div></div><hr />
