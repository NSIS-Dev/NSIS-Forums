<br />
I am using an RTF file in my licence dialog and am also using the ScrollLIcennse plugin. However when clicking down through the Licence the buttons become enabled after scrolling down about 3 screesn (licence is approx 6 page downs worth).<br />
<br />
This behaviour can be seen using the included ExampleNormal.nsi and changing the MUI_PAGE_LICENSE to a large ish RTF file.<br />
<br />
Is there some limit on the file size that this can handle?<br />
<br />
If I take the rtf file and save it as .txt and include this instead it then works fine.<br />
<br />
I've attached an example licence in txt format (can't attach rtf) which if you save as rtf it shows the bhaviour<br />
<br />
I've had a look at the cpp but can't really see why this would be happenning unless the rtf send some unexpected line code.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
thanks for the quick response, I did have alook at this and If I chane this (It seems to show 9 lines normally) it has a slight differences in that it gets perhaps one page down further before enabling the buttons.<br />
<br />
I also set my line to be:<br />
<br />
ScrollLicense::Set /NOUNLOAD /LINES 1 <br />
<br />
and this also didn't help as it it enabled when I get to about line 60 of 130<br />
<br />
If I use:<br />
<br />
ScrollLicense::Set /NOUNLOAD /CHECKBOX<br />
<br />
this seems to work fine and only enables when I get to the bottom</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I have time this weekend I will re-write.<br />

<br />
As a workaround I can use the /CHECKBOX option but if you could look at it, it would be appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
