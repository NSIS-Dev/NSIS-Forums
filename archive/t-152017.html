<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nickjohnston</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. <br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out where NSIS saves temporary files it extracts while installing. I have an NSIS installer on my web site (http://www.deeplake.com/internet.shtml - the setup program there) provided by a 3rd party. I would like to customise the program in some way (just by hex editing), but I need to get the uncompressed version first of all. <br />
<br />
This is not an installer in the traditional sense--it does not ask you where files should be put, and it doesn't even install a program. It just creates a dial up networking connection and that's it. <br />
<br />
So, how is NSIS doing this? Is it extracting a file, running it and then deleting it? I've tried killing it half way through and looking through TEMP dirs for a file, but no look. Or is all the functionality implemented in an NSIS script? <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Section<br />
<br />
  #Put other things here<br />
<br />
  InitPluginsDir<br />
  SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
  File &quot;Program.exe&quot;<br />
  ExecWait &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\Program.exe&quot;<br />
  Delete &quot;$PLUGINSDIR\Program.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
  #Put other things here<br />
<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
The $PLUGINSDIR is a directory with different names each time run the installation, that is used to put temporary files (located in $TEMP directory). It is automatically deleted when you exit the installer. If it doesn't be deleted, try RMDir command after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for you reply, however I think you have maybe misunderstood me. I am not writing an installer - I have a compiled installer provided by a 3rd party. I want to access the files that are extracted by the installer--that's all. <br />
<br />
Is there any way that this can be done? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Nick</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on the script.</div></div><hr />
