<br />
I would like to be able to create a VS project that has as its target a NSIS installer. Has anyone here been able to persuade VS to do this?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brasse</div><div class="date">5th November 2007, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that's correct. I want to be able to create a sub project in my solution that will produce the NSIS installer (from my NSIS script). Typically I would have two projects in my solution; one that builds my application and one that builds the installer. When building the whole solution both projects would be built and the end result would be a NSIS installer.<br />
<br />
Am I making any sense? :-)<br />

<br />
I've thought of doing something similar.  For me, I'm leaning towards making it all command line based.<br />
<br />
We need to a) Build projects b) obfuscate the files c) make an installer d) make an auto updater (using NSIS), e) deploy the files and f) change our server's auto update logic to reflect that a new update is available to beta testers.<br />
<br />
I just can't see me pulling all that off from within Visual Studio.  But if there's a way I could tell Visual Studio to run a script which runs steps b through f, I'd be very happy to find out how  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pospec</div><div class="date">6th November 2007, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">b) Do you mean &quot;get&quot; files? If you do then you could write batch to copy them<br />
c) and maybe d) makensis<br />
e), f) On your choice<br />
<br />
&quot;The way how to tell Visual studio&quot; is the Post-build (on successfull build) in your project's settings.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The way how to tell Visual studio&quot; is the Post-build (on successfull build) in your project's settings.The way I presonally prefer to do it is as a separate VS project itself. Specifically, a 'makefile' project with the project's &quot;Build Command Line&quot; property is set to: 'makensis.cmd &quot;arg1&quot; &quot;arg2&quot; ...etc'.<br />
<br />
That way I can Build (or Rebuild) just that one &quot;Setup&quot; project (via right-clicking on it in the Solution Explorer pane and selecting &quot;Project Only&quot;-&gt;&quot;Rebuild only xxx&quot;) without having to rebuild the prerequisite project that creates all the product binaries (which can conceivably, depending on the size of your &quot;product&quot;, take quite a long time!).<br />
<br />
That is to say, there's no need to Rebuild your product binaries in order to rebuild/test your product's INSTALLER project!  ;)<br />
<br />
Just a thought. &lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe NSIS will be also available as a Visual Studio integration in the future. But for now I know 3 integrated solutions for Visual Studio only:<br />
<br />
 Setup and Deployment Projects (MSI based) website (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wx3b589t(VS.80).aspx)<br />
 WiX - integrates WiX toolset (MSI based) website (http://wix.sourceforge.net/votive.html)<br />
 Lexpa - integrates Inno Setup (non-MSI based) website (http://www.lexpa.com/)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SapientCoder</div><div class="date">24th July 2008, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Althought it's not a Visual Studio add-in, the iNSISt Framework (http://www.codeplex.com/insist) looks promising, and a Visual Studio add-in could easily be built on top of it.<br />
<br />
For example, since the framework uses XML files to auto-generate NSIS scripts, a Visual Studio add-in would simply have to edit/regenerate an XML file each time a project's structure changes (files are added, removed, etc.). Then, as was mentioned in previous posts, there are several ways to use Visual Studio to invoke the NSIS compiler on the generated script to &quot;build&quot; it. This would essentially automate the process of maintaining NSIS scripts for VS projects.</div></div><hr />
