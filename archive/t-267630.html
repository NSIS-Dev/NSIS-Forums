<br />
I'm also using Modern UI, but cannot find out how to switch into this type of options page shown on the picture. The default options tree control is too small, it doesn't have anough space for long items, and the scrolling is ugly.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know how to get one of those bigger options tree controls?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm however suspicious about the way, kind-of arse-way, i'd say...<br />
<br />
Is there no decent/white way for achieving the same?<br />
<br />
Just curious....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">12th March 2007, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">There is, by sending OS messages to the controls involved. <br />
<br />
A lot of work and IMHO your case not a real advantage. The only advantage is that you can update to the lates NSIS version easily with no modificatios over and over again<br />
<br />
But, I have to admit, that is the reason I adjust Dialog item positions on the fly myself. See below for a codesnippet, you will get the idea then.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Function MUI_PAGE_INSTALLATION_Setcustomization<br />
<br />
  ;Reposition progressbar<br />
  FindWindow $0 &quot;#32770&quot; &quot;&quot; $HWNDPARENT<br />
  GetDlgItem $1 $0 1004<br />
  System::Call &quot;User32::SetWindowPos(i, i, i, i, i, i, i) b ($1, 0, 0, 90, 0, 0, 0x201)&quot;  ; 0x200 if resize width/height is needed<br />
<br />
FunctionEnd</div></div><hr />

The manual says this makes the descriptions smaller and puts them below the tree - just what you asked for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaly</div><div class="date">12th March 2007, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All!!!<br />
<br />
Thank you so much, guys, it is useful to know all the possible ways, and more than i need. What i was looking for in the beginning is the solution suggested by demiller9<br />
with !define MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_SMALLDESC <br />
<br />
I tried that myself before, but it didn't work because i placed after the pages instead of before. Now that it works i can see the difference from the solution i got by hacking the resources:<br />
<br />
http://www.actrl.co.uk/options.jpg<br />
<br />
This turns out a better solution in my situation than using MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_SMALLDESC because first of all i got no need for a description, and it feels important to see all items when expanded in the tree list. The one with MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_SMALLDESC provides a smaller control that has vertical scroll bars in my case, and just for that reason i went for the hacked version.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you everybody!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
These defines are shown in the MUI documentation, in section 2 under Components page Interface Settings.<br />

<br />
A+!</div></div><hr />
