<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaraza</div><div class="date">25th March 2002, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">After successfully installing the app, I want to prompt the user to enter their database server and database name, so that I can set up their INI file properly.<br />
<br />
Using InstallOptions.dll to do it is fine, but when the page defined for it appears, it doesn't set the focus to the first field. Instead the focus is still on the Next button at the bottom. Is there any way around that?<br />
<br />
Also, I noticed that static text labels (which have no tab value) seem to get tabbed &quot;to&quot; anyway. If I have a page with 4 fields (2 labels, 2 text boxes), I have to press TAB twice to go from text box #1 to textbox #2, since it seems to first go the static text label which is in between them.<br />
<br />
Is there any way around that too?<br />
<br />
Makes the whole install process a bit less professional and more prone to user errors otherwise...<br />
<br />
I'm using 1.96.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance....</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see a more polished InstallOptions.dll (see my recent post on focus and tab issues that make it rather unprofessional). It's the only thing keeping me back from ditching InstallShield.<br />
As it happens, I got annoyed about these the other day too, and made a small mod to fix them.  I was sure I'd seen a mention of an updated InstallOptions since the latest NSIS was installed, but searching the forum I couldn't find it, so I started from the version in NSIS 1.96.<br />
<br />
Anyway, see if this does the trick for you (both modified source and dll included).<br />
