<br />
I have a section of my installer that I don't want run if there has been an error in a previous section.  Right now I have it set up like:<br />
<br />
Section SectionB<br />
	IfErrors SkipSectionB<br />
<br />
	MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Do stuff in section B&quot;<br />
<br />
SkipSectionB:<br />
<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
So basically I call &quot;SetErrors&quot; in the previous section.  If any error occurred, then sectionB is skipped.<br />
<br />
This works, but I was wondering if there is a better way to accomplish the same thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Beth</div></div><hr />

Are you looking for a way to involve the user less, something that take less script, or something that runs faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbh</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Not necesarily any of those options.<br />
<br />
I just was wondering if there was a better (i.e. cleaner) way of disabling a section.  I wasn't able to find a way to do this except for ensuring the error flag is set in a previous section and then checking that value before continuing in the new section.  I suppose I could accomplish the same thing by using a variable other than the error flag.<br />
<br />
Like I said, it works.  I was just wondering if there were other ways to accomplish the same thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
