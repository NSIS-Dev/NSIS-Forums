<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cutie</div><div class="date">6th July 2006, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have successfully install my Pocket PC application.<br />
Unfortunately, when i uninstall it, the application directory cannot be deleted. It says the files is in use. <br />
<br />
The directory that is left behind is:<br />
\Program Files\MyApp\Images\<br />
<br />
The question is did i left out something in the uninstall section of .nsi file?<br />
<br />
Can any1 provide me with an example of the uninstall section?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

To change the working directory of your installer, use SetOutPath. You can set it to $TEMP, for example.</div></div><hr />

kichik,<br />
<br />
i not sure i understand fully. Do you mean i need to SetOutPath in my Uninstall section? \Program Files\MyApp\ is my application folder where the exe file is in and all the subfolders. \Program Files\MyApp\Images\ is the folder left behind when i uninstall. <br />
<br />

You are right. I am using an earlier version, 2.15 because the chap before use this version. Do you think i will have any issues if i upgrade? I just don't want to have any hassle because the deadline is near and i don't want to screw up this late. (-.-&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cutie</div><div class="date">14th July 2006, 02:07</div></div><div class="posttext">well... i have done more test on this and i found out the uninstall section is for the desktop version. Do any1 know how to control uninstallation for the Pocket PC side?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">No, what I'm saying is that you need to use SetOutPath to set the working directory of the uninstaller, if it's set to that directory. If you don't, you won't be able to delete the directory.</div></div><hr />
