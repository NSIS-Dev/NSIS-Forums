Such question. Whether it is possible by means of NSIS to make a exe-file, that it would pack beside laying files separately and put their number... <br />
Example: <br />
in a folder dir files: 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt... <br />
After performance... <br />
In a folder dir files: 1.zip, 2.zip, 3.zip... <br />
<br />
If it is possible, prompt idea (example) or the reference where it is possible to esteem. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume, you are just interested in zipping up the files of any folder. May be using NSIS it would be little tricky, I am not sure but search for zip plug-in(it's there for NSIS), if it helps. <br />
<br />
I would suggest to write an application may be C# or vb.net using SharpZipLib<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Probably I not so was expressed. A kind of compression to me it is not important. The main thing, what as a result of work of an exe-file, files being near to it were packed on one. As I badly understand programming, it would be desirable to carry out conceived in NSIS (I have a little understood it).<br />
