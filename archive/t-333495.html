<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mercurix</div><div class="date">12th August 2011, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">im kinda new to nsis and im am stuck big time because i dont know how should i do this.<br />
<br />
so ill start with the basic:<br />
<br />
i have lets say 3 archives (a1,a2,a3) and i want to make a standalone setup (setup.exe) that will extract those archives based on a file f.e. we will name it setup.ini that is outside the installer (in here will be included the names of the archives and the order in which will be extracted like a1-a2-a3) ... now comes teh tricky part if i make another set of archives lets say b1,b2,b3 and i put them in the ini file i want them to be extracted the same way as the first ones so i dont need to make a new installer every time i want to add an archive<br />
<br />
nsis has a bunch of plugs but to tell the truth i could not figure how to do this (or im stupid and didnt search to good, i did manage to make them unpack using some plug-ins but that is all i could manage) and im stuck and i would appreciate some help.<br />
<br />
thx in advance and if is possible except some hints and code examples would be excellent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use ReadIniStr etc to read from the ini. Use the plugin (or 7za.exe etc) to unpack the archive. It's as simple as that.</div></div><hr />
