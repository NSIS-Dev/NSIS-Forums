I'm in need for a recommendation for a good unzipping plugin for NSIS since I need to ship large files with the installer.<br />
<br />
I'm currently trying the nsisunz plugin but I'm running into problems. I don't seem to be able to use a local folder path for the extraction script. Here's the problem:<br />
<br />
I've got the nsis compiled installer along with the zip file lying in a random folder. I don't seem to be able to have the installer extract the file from this same folder without giving an absolute folder path to the zip file. This is absolutely necessary for me though as I have no idea where the users will place the install files. They could be in a downloads folder, on a CD or somewhere else altogether. I'm currently using the following command in my installer:<br />
<br />
nsisunz::Unzip &quot;test.zip&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
The above line does not work while the following will work when all files are placed in &quot;C:\installer_test_folder&quot;:<br />
<br />
nsisunz::Unzip &quot;C:\installer_test_folder\test.zip&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
Any idea on how I can give the script the path of the folder where the user runs the installer from so I don't have to use hardcoded paths?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I tried $EXEPATH before which didn't work. Leaves me wondering what this was supposed to do. Anyway $EXEDIR is working fine so thanks for the quick help.</div></div><hr />

It's because of the definition of 'path', which is misunderstood often.</div></div><hr />
