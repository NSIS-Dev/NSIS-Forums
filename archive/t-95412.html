<br />
IsAdmin is a DLL for NSIS that determines if the current (impersonated) user has administrator priviledges. Returns 1 to NSIS if it does, 0 or a GetLastErorr number to the caller if not.<br />
<br />
Reference: Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - Q118626<br />
<br />
Hope this be helpful.<br />
Source code and DSW project in the archive. If you need a compiled DLL, please ask. Free of use, blah blah. That's the kind of DLL I'd like to see in the Contribs of NISI :)<br />
<br />
Tested with 1.95... oops need to update now :-)<br />

<br />
(FYI http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/x18servicesV0.0.zip was what I was referring to and is mentioned in this forum if you search back)<br />
<br />
I've hosted your file on my archive and added an entry on the  downloads page (http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/Downloads), I'll add a proper page for it soon (it's on the pending list (http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/PendingArchiveItems))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ralfoide</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. I had a look at the winamp.com and your archives and I completly missed that x18services DLL :confused: -- I'm rather new to NSIS and there's a lot of material around. :) <br />
<br />
Anyway, I may need that functionnality later, so it's good to know where to find it. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for the hosting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah sorry about that - the comments on the services DLL mostly focused on the services side, the IsAdministrator function was in there because to manipulate services you generally need to be an administrator so it seemed relevant.<br />
<br />
You won't find anything on my archive site if you search for administrator because I haven't had time to document my own DLLs that are hosted there, I've prioritised other people's stuff over my own so my services dll literally only gets a link on the download page at the moment.</div></div><hr />
