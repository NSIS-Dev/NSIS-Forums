<br />
I have a problem with my installer. It has a really long launch time. I tried with the /NCRC flag and the launch time was way shorter.<br />
<br />
I searched the forum and found that the crc check dialog is only displayed if it'll last more than 1 second. It's definitely the case with my installer but I've never seen it.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to force it to show up?<br />
<br />
I'm using NSIS 2.45 but had the same issue with 2.18 and 2.40.</div></div><hr />

It shows immediately for me on execution.<br />
<br />
However I have not yet had an installer that shows the CRC banner nor have I tried this code in one so I'm not sure what kind of effect it would have (uses the same dialog).<br />

<br />
While it's not as fancy as a progress bar it's still better than the user launching the installer a second time before the first one is up and running.</div></div><hr />
