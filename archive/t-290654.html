<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simulation</div><div class="date">22nd April 2008, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using execwait to launch a batch file that copies some files from a network location and then runs a setup program.<br />
XP works fine, but under Vista the nsis installer just continues after a couple of seconds while the files are still being copied in the DOS window?<br />
<br />
I was also experiencing the similar problem with nsExec::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd April 2008, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use CopyFiles to copy files.<br />
<br />
As for not waiting - you should execute and wait for cmd.exe, or better yet - %COMSPEC%, as .bat files are not really executables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simulation</div><div class="date">22nd April 2008, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
<br />
I have just tested the comspec method<br />
<br />
ReadEnvStr $3 COMSPEC<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$3&quot; /K r:\latest\installcam.cmd'<br />
<br />
Again, this works fine on XP, but still continues after a few seconds in Vista whilst the command window is still open?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">22nd April 2008, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">/K means keep open after the batch is done, try /C and see if maybe your batch file has a bug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">22nd April 2008, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Try throwing Vista out the window. That might help.<br />
<br />
Frustration based humor aside, my best suggestion is that you don't use a batch file and use CopyFiles. If you really must use a batch file, give me something to test this on so I can reproduce and check it with my own eyes.</div></div><hr />
