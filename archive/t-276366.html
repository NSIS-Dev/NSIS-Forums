<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">7th November 2007, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to have professional-looking installer icons &amp; bitmap which don't disappoint the user, I always use the basic &quot;computer with box of disks/CD&quot; installation icon, and a classic deep-blue wizard.<br />

Sometimes when the program is aimed at programmers rather than any end-user, I might use the modern-install.ico round icon and/or the orange NSIS theme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">7th November 2007, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">So regarding those new theme, I don't have much advice as long as you keep some classical theme ;)<br />
<br />
Well I can say that I don't like too much the end of the arrows that is &quot;turning back&quot;. I find it weird..<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks Yathosho for the effort</div></div><hr />

I didn't &quot;get&quot; what the new logo was until I read Yathosho's tip to tilt your head. I doubt that my users will pick up on that either. My initial reaction was not very favorable, but I am starting to like it better now. <br />
<br />
I hope you don't plan to remove the round icons that are the current default. They are still my favorite.<br />
<br />

<br />
I love nsis, and I can't wait for the official release of MUI 2. But, I never use the default icons &amp; bitmaps. These new ones are certainly better than the current ones, but the visual metaphor is still unclear.<br />
<br />
Don't let the lack of participation in this one thread dissuade you from releasing MUI 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a counter-argument when judging the installer just by the given description would be something like &quot;how unprofessional, still that old (visualbasic) installer&quot;. a look different from that old &quot;standard&quot; implies the manufacturer took some effort. not that the look of an installer defines its quality, but defining a unique identity for nsis installers would do no better, especially when it comes to attracting more users. of course, the choice of using the preferred graphics is still there.<br />
<br />
btw, there are also simple (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=2256804#post2256804) designs based on that logo!<br />

that icon was my main reason to come up with something unique and strong for nsis. unless you are familiar with nsis, it gives no clue it's an installer, even when you size it up enough to read the word nsis that's in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">8th November 2007, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it would be a good idea for you to contact the designer of the current NSIS logo (Nikos Adamamas) to discuss a new logo.<br />
<br />
I like the simple shape of your logo. Do you also have a preview of a small icon (16x16 pixels)?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If you want to look like old visualbasic installer, put a fullscreen color-blend background and a big button that no one understands as being the button to click to start the installation ;-)<br />
<br />
MUI1 is modern enough for me. (for now)<br />

<br />
For the icon, I understand your point about originality..<br />
But I want an icon the user wont be afraid to click on. When download a program, some people might be afraid to catch spyware or such and don't want to install something that doesn't look like a well-known installer icon.<br />

Yes, I agree.. In fact, I was wrong, when using the orange theme, I don't use the round NSIS icon, but the orange-install.ico icon that looks more like an installer.<br />
If you come up with an icon that really looks like an installer and that I like (i'm not fond on that turn-back-thing on your arrow), then I might use it sometimes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">galevsky</div><div class="date">9th November 2007, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">My two cents: the up and down arrows are not really &quot;readable&quot;, imho, I think that any user that never used NSIS installers before will be a bit confused... but why not ? I like the very nice smoothy aspect (good job ;) ). If lots of installers adopt these icons... it could become one standard and people used to these arrows. As for colors, don't hesitate to decline your theme in lots of colors to suit user preferences (purple, yellow, red, dark blue, light blue, dark green, ligth green, grey, brown and so on).<br />
