<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">19th October 2008, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the VERSION method exemplified in the various samples that come with NSIS is straightforward and easy in a single file .nsi script:<br />
!ifndef VERSION<br />
  !define VER_MAJOR &quot;3&quot;<br />
  !define VER_MINOR &quot;0&quot;<br />
  !define VER_REVISION &quot;1&quot;<br />
  !define VER_BUILD &quot;15&quot;<br />
  !define VERSION ${VER_MAJOR}.${VER_MINOR}.${VER_REVISION}.${VER_BUILD}<br />
However, when the product's .nsi script remains unchanged but one (or more) of the !include files in it change, I currently must edit the product's .nsi file manually, only to change VER_BUILD (or VER_REVISION). This is currently my poor man's solution to reflect the fact that a newly compiled setup.exe is different from the previous one.<br />
<br />
My problem now is that I have numerous such main scripts and it is simply too tedious to manually update every one of them whenever a dependency !include file changes...<br />
<br />
Is there a way or solution to automatically increment VER_BUILD or VER_REVISION whenever one of the !include files in the script changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">19th October 2008, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This should get you thinking. Here's a snippet from one of my nsi scripts. !execute &quot;wscript.exe ..\BuildNum.vbs&quot;<br />
!include &quot;BuildNum.nsh&quot;<br />
VIProductVersion  &quot;${VERSION}.${BuildNum}&quot;<br />
 and BuildNum.nsh looks like this:!define BuildNum 8274.5<br />
<br />
Our development team defines the Major and Minor version numbers and I append a 4 digit value for the date plus a serialized number for the installer build number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">19th October 2008, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several ways to do this:<br />
<br />
a) <br />
use !execute or !system to generate some external nsh that you include<br />
<br />
b)<br />
use !searchparse (or !define /file)<br />
<br />
c)<br />
use a special include file that is both a valid nsis header and .h for C/C++ (See http://anders.nsis.pastebin.com/f575397bc for a ugly example)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">19th October 2008, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks demiller9 and Anders. I think that demiller9's suggestion along with Anders's option (a) is the only viable option, since the mechanism must be smart at least like make/nmake.<br />
<br />
The reason is that I need a system that knows several things, not one:<br />
[list=1]<br />
  Determine which !include files are dependencies.<br />
  Determine that one of the !include dependency files is newer (based on timestamp and perhaps content).<br />
  Automatically increment the build number.<br />
  Perhaps more (did I forget something?)<br />
[/list=1]<br />
Funny, because I initially thought of the setup program as something outside of the make/nmake system.<br />
<br />
But now it seems that good development methodology must involve make for compiling well structured NSIS scripts as well.</div></div><hr />
