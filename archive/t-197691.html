<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cryptchamber</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">well thanks Davion, i found a way to do what i need and i'll post the little code for this purpose.<br />
<br />
this goes in the section where u select the files, or it can be too on the section where u run other programs, in case u want to install first the prog u are going to read the value of, for the installer. It reads the Reg Value where the path of the program is installed, and assign that value to $0, after that i say to it that the output dir where i'm gonna copy those files is $0, and where the files to copy are. <br />
<br />
<br />
ReadRegStr $0 HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Firebird Project\Firebird Server\Instances&quot; DefaultInstance<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$0&quot;<br />
File &quot;C:\ib6\RunImageLw2\firebirdsecurity\*&quot;<br />
<br />
hope it helps someone with the same prob i had. sorry for my bad english :D</div></div><hr />
