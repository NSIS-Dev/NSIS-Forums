<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 07:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Now I'm sure that I have searched the Forums and the Helpfiles, but anyway there where no results matching on my needs<br />
<br />
My Problem is quite simple I think (don't know if the solution is too):<br />
<br />
I want to run the Installer from a Shared Network folder<br />
as an Example &quot;\\SERVER\Shared\&quot; which is &quot;C:\Program Files\My App&quot; on this machine<br />
<br />
so the path of the installer would be shown like this in the Network:<br />
&quot;\\SERVER\Shared\Installer.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
When I use $EXEDIR in the Installer I only get &quot;C:\Program Files\My App&quot; But I need the &quot;Shared Path&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope anyone understands what I mean...<br />
<br />
(Yes, I've searched the Forums - Yes, I found the Stuff about the IPs - No, I don't understand much about APIs - and yes, I'm despaired)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Messagebox MB_OK &quot;Exedir is $EXEDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
and I can see &quot;Exedir is \\Bar\takhir&quot;<br />
Please note, that this (Lnux Samba) path is NOT mounted as network drive.</div></div><hr />
