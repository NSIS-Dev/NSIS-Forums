<br />
* is it a swear-word, when i add to &quot;shit&quot; an &quot;y&quot;? = shity.<br />
if yes can i do also: fucky or bitchy, atc...?<br />
(i`m asking just to make my english better :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be done, but the point of zip2exe is just to create a self-extracting file.  It does it by extracting contents to a temp directory and creating a temporary nsi file.  If you need something more complicated, I would think you would need to extract the file yourself to create the installer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use<br />
File *.*<br />
So you can select all files. That'll save you some typing :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">1st November 2001, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">But if you have multiple files, then the *.* wouldn't work. It would copy all of the files in the first folder that you put the *.* on (if that made any sense). But I do see your point. I would have it if I had to make a huge installer and I didn't want to write the code. But most of the GUIs being developed in the forums could help you the most. They have syntax highlighting and other things that can help you develop the perfect installer. Now, I would love to see the Zip2Exe program create a nsi file so that I may have a template to see what is it that he did, but I would also like to see the Zip2Exe program do other additional functions. Things like adding a licence and BrandingText and other items that we could use to create an Exe from an Zip. But then that would take away from the point that the installer had in the first place. Create a great installer from a small text file.<br />

Shitty is spelt with 2 't's, and is a word (meaning 'very bad' as you used it).  Bitchy is also a word, but fucky isn't.<br />
<br />
hope that helps :D <br />

DuaneJeffers, I don't understand what you mean re *.* not working :confused: :confused: :confused: :confused: :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
*.* is not recursive.  However if you say:<br />
<br />
File /r C:\somedir\anotherdir<br />
<br />
Then the files can be added recursively.  See the docs for the difference between that and<br />
<br />
File /r C:\somedir\anotherdir\*.*<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petersa</div><div class="date">5th November 2001, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">ZIP2EXE simply extracts the ZIP file to a temporary folder, and writes a short script the includes this line to do all the work:<br />
<br />
File /r `C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\z2eD8C6.TMP\*.*`<br />
<br />
Here's an actual .NSI script that the ZIP2EXE prog actually makes:<br />
<br />
Name `pfsupdate`<br />
Caption `pfsupdate Self Extractor`<br />
OutFile `C:\PFS Work\pfsupdate.exe`<br />
InstallDir `$EXEDIR`<br />
Function SetMyOutPath<br />
  SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
DirText `Select the folder where you would like to extract the files to:`<br />

Call SetMyOutPath<br />
