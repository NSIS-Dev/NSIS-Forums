<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">5th November 2006, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, could someone help using the igameexplorer interface from windows vista with nsis' system.dll?<br />
<br />
i already have my executable modified with the gdf (game definition file) data as described in the ms directx sdk. now, the next step to take is registering the executable via an api call. <br />
<br />
here is what the directx sdk readme states<br />
Once the GDF and related files have been added to a binary resource, it is then possible to integrate the game with Game Explorer. It is strongly advised that games integrate with Game Explorer during the installation process. The outline to the integration process is as follows:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Install ALL files to the user's hard drive. The next step activates parental controls and could potentially lock the user out of the installation directory. <br />
 Create an instance to the IGameExplorer interface. <br />
 Call the VerifyAccess method, of the IGameExplorer interface and pass it the path to the GDF. <br />
 Call the AddGame method, of the IGameExplorer interface and pass it the path to the GDF, the path to the root installation directory, and a unique GUID called the game instance ID. <br />
 Create shortcuts, which are Game Explorer tasks, by using the game instance ID. Game Explorer tasks are explained in the next section. [/list=1] <br />

<br />
works quite well, except one thing. in my case the guid is generated before - in the game definition file editor.<br />
i tried both, with the sample binary with gdf information and my own binary and both the last parameter of addline  could be left empty or even should left empty. i am not much into the gdf thing yet, so i don't know why this last parameter is there anyway as in the vista registry the guid of the is taken anyway.<br />
the line<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::GenerateGUID(*g .r0)&quot;<br />
crashes the installer. as i seem not to require it anyway i left it out, everything else seems to run smooth yet though i didn't try the uninstaller yet but looking at the lines you wrote that could be more a problem than addline cause of the guid thing i do not totally understand ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th November 2006, 21:11</div></div><div class="posttext">GenerateGUID might need an allocated buffer like CoCreateGuid. In which case, its usage should be:System::Alloc 16<br />
System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::GenerateGUID(i sr0)&quot;or even:System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::GenerateGUID(g .r0)&quot;I'd need the DLL to verify. Could you attach it? Though you're probably correct that it just generates a new GUID. It doesn't take any parameters relating to the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th November 2006, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">As I thought, it just calls CoCreateGuid. The last usage example I wrote should work. It'd probably have the same effect if you generate the GUID in advance on your computer, but I can't be sure of that. According to MSDN, it's the InstanceID, so it's probably per-computer after all.<br />
<br />
MSDN also says:Callers should store the instanceID returned by this call as it is necessary to call RemoveGame or UpdateGame, and to create tasks for the game within the Game Explorer.<br />
<br />
If the call is made to upgrade a legacy title to a supported title the ID returned in pguidInstanceID will be the same as the legacy entry.It seems AddGame would return a different GUID then the one passed, if the game is already installed. All `*g r0` instances in the script above should therefore be changed to `gr0` and the first instance, in the call to AddToGameExplorer should be changed to `gr0r0` so that AddToGameExplorer would be able to change the GUID.</div></div><hr />

today i played with the uninstaller and couldn't get it working. i forgot to copy the gameuxinstallhelper.dll in the first place but i added it later so the uninstaller part does now look like that<br />
${If} ${AtLeastWinVista}<br />
  SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
  File GameuxInstallHelper.dll # from dxsdk<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::RetrieveGUIDForApplication(t '${GDF}', *g .r0)&quot;<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::RemoveFromGameExplorer(*g .r0)&quot;<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::RemoveTasks(*g .r0)&quot;<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::RemoveRichSaveGames(t '.ExampleSaveGame')&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
i tested it and the path to ${GDF} is also correct set to the gdf binary.<br />
Another problem i am experiencing are random crashes sometimes the installer calls the dll functions - both with the installer and uninstaller<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">8th January 2007, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">does the dll not exist on every vista system?<br />
<br />
if it does exist on every vista system, you should not include it in your setup but rather check, whether the user has the dll already and then call the functions or don't, if he has no windows vista (because then they're all useless).<br />
<br />
if it is not installed on vista by default you should indeed include the dll into your installer.<br />
<br />
this is quite simple:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
File GameuxInstallHelper.dll<br />
<br />
you may need to modify your dll calls to:<br />
<br />
system::call '$PLUGINSDIR\GameuxInstallHelper.dll::blabla()'</div></div><hr />

I've put up a wiki page with the code at:<br />

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Game_explorer<br />
<br />
One thing of interest I discovered is that if you try and create a game explorer link for the current user it fails unless you are an administrator as it tries to write to HKLM - this is in conflict with what the documentation says but there's very little other information about Game Explorer at the moment.<br />

<br />
You need to use code more like that in the wiki. For a start the defines at the top of your code are incorrect. Also you need to RequestUserLevel admin at the top (it seems that applies even if you are trying to install for a current user).<br />
<br />
Also you need to generate a GUID and store it in the registry when you install, then use that value to uninstall. Copying the code from the wiki entry at:<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Game_explorer<br />
<br />
should make it work. Hope that helps,<br />

Moral of this story.  If you are getting totally weird results, double check you have the right files.<br />
<br />
For other people's sanity:<br />
32 bit version of GameuxInstallerHelper is around 77 k<br />

Possibly the GUID passed to the functions needs to be the same as in the GDF resource, but if that's the case, what's the point of having a GenerateGUID function in GameuxInstallHelper instead of an ExtractGUID function?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't, the GUID that you use for passing into the game explorer should be unique so that you could potentially add multiple versions/installs of the game to the explorer if you really wanted to.  The GenerateGUID was failing for me because I had the 64 bit version of the dll instead of the 32 bit version on a 32 bit system.<br />
<br />
we use:<br />
<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::GenerateGUID(g .r0)&quot;<br />
  StrCmp $0 '{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}' finished<br />
<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::AddToGameExplorer(t 'path_to_gdf_file', t 'path_to_exe', i ${GIS_ALL_USERS}, g r0) i .r4&quot;<br />
<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::CreateTask(i ${GIS_ALL_USERS}, g r0, i  1, i 0, t 'Play', t 'path_to_exe', t 'arguments') i .r4&quot;<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::CreateTask(i ${GIS_ALL_USERS}, g r0, i  0, i 0, t 'Support', t 'path_to_exe', t 'arguments') i .r4&quot;<br />
<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::SetupRihcSavedGames(t '.save_game_extension', t 'path_to_exe', t 'Save_game_descriptor') i .r4&quot;<br />
<br />
  System::Call &quot;GameuxInstallHelper::RegisterWithMediaCenter(t 'path_to_gdf_file', t 'path_to_mcl_location', i ${GIS_ALL_USERS}, t 'path_to_exe', t 'args', i 0) i .r4&quot;<br />
finished:<br />
<br />
<br />
${GIS_ALL_USERS} = 3, can be 1 for current user instead (HKCU vs LM and for limited user can be 1)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps anyone else that is trying to get this up and running.<br />

The &quot;Games&quot; plugin looks like it will only work if the GDF is embedded in the EXE, not if it's in a separate DLL, and requires MSVCR80.dll. The &quot;GameExplorer&quot; header doesn't handle Media Center (and also looks a little buggy - I mean, why swap the GDF path and INSTDIR depending on current or all users?), and neither currently supports rich saved games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">29th March 2008, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">GameExplorer header is smaller, simpler, easier to get and just works. Just look at the length of this GameuxInstallHelper related thread to see what I mean. I've created the GameExplorer headers to help users avoid this DLL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mauvecloud</div><div class="date">29th March 2008, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm doubtful of the &quot;just works&quot; part. I still don't understand the reversal of R0 and R1 depending on ${CONTEXT} in the following snippet:<br />
<br />
  !if ${CONTEXT} == all<br />
    System::Call &quot;$1-&gt;${IGameExplorer_AddGame}(w R0, w R1, i ${GIS_ALL_USERS}, g R2) i .r0&quot;<br />
  !else if ${CONTEXT} == user<br />
    System::Call &quot;$1-&gt;${IGameExplorer_AddGame}(w R1, w R0, i ${GIS_CURRENT_USER}, g R2) i .r0&quot;<br />
  !else<br />
    !error &quot;Invalid CONTEXT passed to GameExplorer_AddGame! Must be `user` or `all`.&quot;<br />
  !endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think the clarifications in this thread can be summarized as follows, and maybe added to a wiki page about GameuxInstallHelper:<br />
1. The correct parameter type to use for the GUID (it's &quot;g&quot;, not &quot;i&quot; or &quot;*g&quot; - the System plugin takes care of creating a GUID from the string and passing a pointer to it)<br />
2. Use the 32-bit version of GameuxInstallHelper.dll, not the 64-bit version (unless maybe you want to only allow the game to be installed on a 64-bit system)<br />
3. The GUID can be generated during the install, and shouldn't be the same as the gameID in the GDF resource.<br />
Once those three things are understood, using GameuxInstallHelper is almost as easy as the GameExplorer header or Games plugin.</div></div><hr />

For comparison:<br />
Weaknesses of old Game Explorer header:<br />
1. No save game support<br />
2. No media center support<br />
3. Additional tasks have to be created manually (with long paths to remember)<br />
4. No support for pre-Vista systems that might get upgraded<br />
<br />
Weaknesses of Games plug-in:<br />
1. Requires msvcr80.dll (612 KB)<br />
2. Can't handle GDF in separate dll<br />
3. No save game support<br />
4. All tasks have to be created manually<br />
5. No support for pre-Vista systems that might get upgraded<br />
<br />
Weaknesses of Game Explorer with Helper header:<br />
1. Requires GameuxInstallHelper.dll (95 KB)<br />
2. Doesn't support more than one game per installer</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you change the macro for the adding the game to do a check to see if the dll is already written out, then it should work fine to add multiple games, as long as you make sure to always add them in sequence.<br />
<br />
  !ifndef GAME_EXPLORER_DLL_EXISTS<br />
    !ifdef GAME_EXPLORER_HELPER_PATH<br />
      File &quot;/oname=GameuxInstallHelper.dll&quot; &quot;${GAME_EXPLORER_HELPER_PATH}&quot;<br />
    !else<br />
      File &quot;GameuxInstallHelper.dll&quot;<br />
    !endif<br />
    !define GAME_EXPLORER_DLL_EXISTS<br />
  !endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, another suggestion, for localization reasons, I'd pull the &quot;Play&quot; task out of the first macro, otherwise the French will see &quot;Play&quot;.  Or put them in as extra label options.  (Same for support), or make them come from language strings $(GameExplorerPlayTask) or something.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mauvecloud</div><div class="date">30th March 2008, 06:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Supporting more than one game per installer took a little more than just checking for the dll, due to the way it had been using defines for the play task number and support task number, which wouldn't work if the task adding was done in a function declared before the one that added the game, so I switched to variables, and it should be more robust now.<br />
<br />
As far as localization, I see your point, but I don't want to force the use of LangStrings, so I pulled the task adding out of the GameExplorer_AddGame, and GameExplorer_AddPlayTask and GameExplorer_AddSupportTask already allow the task names to be specified separately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nico_BF</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Everybody,<br />
<br />
I tried both posted versions of the game explorer integration and both worked quite well except for one thing. I was not able to insert the age control to the game explorer. It is definately set in the GDF file but it just doesn't show up.<br />
<br />
In the old version it is missing and so I tried to add VerifyAccess to the macro like this<br />
<br />
System::Call &quot;$1-&gt;${IGameExplorer_VerifyAccess}(w R0, i R4) i .r0&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately with no success.<br />
<br />
In the new version it seems to me that the VerifyAccess is already implemented into the AddToGameExplorerA function but the age control still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any idea what the problem might be?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help!</div></div><hr />
