<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bviksoe</div><div class="date">28th May 2005, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Excuse me for asking something that probably has already been discussed, but I was wondering what GUI to use for NSIS. I'm looking for a Windows product that will allow users to easily specify the installation (point'n'click) to get started with a nice NSIS project quickly.<br />
<br />
I know there are several (!!!) projects available on SourceForge that wrap NSIS installer in a GUI, but they seem to be alpha/pre-beta - or to be honest, pretty crappy - tools.<br />
<br />
I've previously used InstallShield Express which is a nice (but extremely buggy) user-interface for building Windows Installer packages. I was wondering if a NSIS equivalent exists? Something an average user can use; without needing programming knowledge; and not just an editor!! Needs to handle files, registry, shortcuts, dialog editor, scripts/systemcheck/behaviour inclusion by point'n'click.<br />
<br />
Any advise? What do you use?<br />
Do I have to develop it myself :)<br />
<br />

I didn't rely on it to do everything but I've used it to start the base template. From there, I just used help and posted unanswered questions here on this forum. The help here is astounding. It seems everyones itching to help you out.<br />
<br />
As far as I know about there being a do-everything NSIS GUI, we'll I've never heard of it. I don't even think there is any on the horizon. I am currently working with a developer on building a brand new IO designer. Word is he will have a beta out by this Monday or Tuesday. We'll have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
If you find anything interesting I for one am interested. Thanks!</div></div><hr />
