Unfortunately he finds it more and more difficult to find spare time for NSIS. So, first of all, thank you Sebastian for your time and help!<br />
<br />
Once again, we are in search for a new documentation writer. Whoever volunteers for this should have a fair knowledge of English, NSIS and of course should have some free time.<br />
<br />
We also need someone to work on The Archive and the NSIS Developer Site as a whole. This job requires PHP and MySQL knowledge.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested in either one just reply here or send me a PM (http://forums.winamp.com/private.php?s=&amp;action=newmessage&amp;userid=44024).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
   The NSIS Team</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th June 2003, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">If the document writer will have time for it. Or anyone else with time to finish this. But it should be really ready which means there should be a script/batch file to create the CHM files easily from the HTML files. The HTML files should remain intact for the website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">10th June 2003, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We do have a simple CHM generator, but still no support for external links etc, Halibut integration etc. If somebody who can code C wants to help us to modify Halibut, that would be great.<br />
<br />
The task of the doc writer is to maintain, upgrade and improve NSIS documentation.<br />
<br />
Also, we want to improve the NSIS 2 website (more info, CMS-based etc.), but we might need to find other hosting because of SF limitations.</div></div><hr />
