You can do all of the things you wanted but graphics. Maybe graphics will make a nice addition :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">but i wanted to have some action before / after Contrib\Install Options<br />
<br />
ok it works also there but it would be nicer to have it extra ...<br />
<br />
like <br />
<br />
title : install finished<br />
<br />
(branding image)<br />
<br />
checkboxes<br />
<br />
create desktop icon<br />
show readme<br />
start program now<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

Just call it in .onInstSuccess, or in one of the sections and work according to its input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could use WriteINIStr before and ReadINIStr after InstallOptions within your NSIS script<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">will try this<br />
<br />
maybe image support comes in 1.9 ...<br />
<br />
but maybe can help me <br />
<br />
you may know this :<br />
<br />
 Function .onInit<br />
    MessageBox MB_YESNO &quot;This will install. Continue?&quot; IDYES NoAbort<br />
      Abort ; causes installer to quit.<br />
    NoAbort:<br />
  FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
and instead of this ( i think ugly) msgbox i would use the main window (just for having the same style)<br />
<br />
is this possible ????<br />
<br />
if not can this be included ?<br />
(easyly)<br />
<br />
i'm not so experienced in c programming ...<br />
<br />
but i think thats not so hard to program <br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">11th December 2001, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i've got the installoptions but :<br />
<br />
it seems to be impossible to use this on init<br />
<br />
(maybe because the window isnt there already)<br />
<br />
if i use it there then the full monitor is used<br />
<br />
can this be changed ???<br />
<br />
<br />
also support for horizontal lines schould be implemented <br />
<br />
then it would look like winamp <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe this can be changed ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hando</div><div class="date">11th December 2001, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem - trying to get InstallOptions to work with .onInit. Felfert released a patch (for v1.67) that added an extra callback which would allow you to do what you want on the first dialog window. Unfortunately I've not been able to apply the patch or find another way of doing it successfully.<br />
<br />
You could cheat a little and create 2 installers. The first installer is silent BUT if you use InstallOptions within a section it will display the NSIS window (well, it draws a window in the top left of the screen the size of NSIS but with a &quot;windows flag&quot; icon , so pretty much the same thing). You could write to the registry or a file whatever relevenat information and then use the second installer to read that info and execute applications, etc.<br />
<br />
Is that kinda what you're after? It's not the nicest way of doing it but without additional callbacks I really don't know of any other way.<br />
<br />
Here's the link for Felfert's patch:http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=66463</div></div><hr />
