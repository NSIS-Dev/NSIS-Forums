<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bedbuffer</div><div class="date">23rd April 2009, 07:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I made an updater which silently runs in XP and works just fine. But when it comes to Vista, the idea of silent installation gets ruined when UAC prompts the user to cancel or allow the user from running the program. <br />
<br />
Is there anything at all we can do about this?<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way to suppress the prompt with UAC enabled is to have an application manifest set to run as a normal user (RequestExecutionLevel user)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would it be possible to have an &quot;updater&quot; windows service running at admin rights which downloads and runs the update?<br />
<br />
Just a side note on batch files in Vista.  I've found you have to right click them and choose &quot;Run as admin...&quot;.  If you just double click them, and they try to do something that requires admin rights, then they will often simply fail silently with a &quot;permission denied&quot; or a similar error(which you won't see when the console window flashes up breifly), rather than prompt for UAC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">24th April 2009, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, it would be possible, but the service would require a UAC prompt during install (but, please, don't fill your end users systems with useless services)<br />
<br />
Look at firefox, it will show a UAC dialog when you apply updates.</div></div><hr />
