<br />
I'm executing an executable file embeeded in my NSIS setup.<br />
My problem is that the service of the installed application is not running at the end of that executable file.<br />
<br />
I have checked for a Service plugin, that doesn't work (error 1060, the specified service is not an installed service).<br />
<br />
<br />
So I want to restart the computer before continuying my NSIS setup, so that my service can start correctly before I continue my NSIS setup.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to reboot the computer ans to automatically continue the NSIS setup when the computer is started again ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answers</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Why does it say the service isn't installed? Have you installed it or does your application do it? You could install it using the SimpleSC plugin saving you from rebooting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sylvinhio</div><div class="date">28th April 2009, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The service is installed by the installer launched through the NSIS script.<br />
The installer is to install PostgreSQL and the service is not run at the end of the install.<br />
<br />
So when I try to get it like that :<br />
<br />
SimpleSC::ServiceIsRunning &quot;MyService&quot;<br />
Pop $0 ;<br />
Pop $1 ;<br />
<br />
Messagebox MB_OK &quot;Service running ? ==&gt; $0&quot;<br />
<br />
That displays the following message<br />
<br />
Service running ? ==&gt; 1060<br />
<br />
And the error 1060 means that &quot;The specific service does not exist as an installed service&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't know why ... If you have any ideas...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">28th April 2009, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You will have to make another installer which just has the instfiles page and a finish page which you extract in the first installer and set to run in RunOnce before rebooting.<br />
