<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vtsaran</div><div class="date">5th December 2007, 06:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
OK, I searched everywhere but could not find any answers to my question below (perhaps wrong keywords?).<br />
I am trying to have my installer modify file paths during the file extraction based on the user input. Very likely I am doing something wrong because NSIS badly complains at me.<br />
Here is an example:<br />
<br />
Say, I would like different files to be extracted depending on the language that the user chooses from a dropdown list. I store their choice in a user variable $MyLang, like so<br />
<br />
var $MyLang<br />
<br />
In the &quot;install&quot; section, I would like to do this:<br />
IfFileExists &quot;..\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile&quot; 0 +3<br />
file &quot;..\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile&quot;<br />
goto SomewhereElse<br />
MessageBox MB_OK &quot;No supporting files for your particular language found ,defaulting to English.&quot;<br />
file &quot;..\SomePath\SomeFileInEnglish&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems that both IFFileExists and File commands ignore my $MyLang variable. In the case of File instruction NSIS complains that &quot;..\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile&quot; cannot be found.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how I can solve this problem?<br />
I am suspecting that NSIS doesn't like my variables because they are filled in at runtime, but there has to be some way around this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
Regards,<br />
Vic</div></div><hr />

Have you considered writing a macro or function to extract the files for each language you are supporting?  You can still take the input from the user and then put the MyLang variable into a switch or a series of if else if, and then NSIS only extract the files according to the selected language.  It may make your installer bigger than you wanted, and there is probably a better solution out there, but it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vtsaran</div><div class="date">5th December 2007, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your suggestion. I guess, this would my last choice as I wanted all the matching happen automatically. In my installer tree I have folders that are named according to the language abbreviations and it would be easier if the extraction was dependant on one variable rather than on the set of if-else statements. This means that I would not have to modify the installer every time a new language (think folder) is added.<br />
Any more cool ideas out there? :)<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coolblu77</div><div class="date">6th December 2007, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why the IfFileExisits would ignore your variable.<br />
<br />
But I was under the impression that File was used to add files in at compile time and then extract them during installation.<br />
So it makes sense that a variable cannot be used here.<br />
<br />
How about, adding the extra files you want to distribute along with the installation.exe, not compiled into the exe but in a seperate folder, then use something like:<br />
  CopyFiles &quot;$EXEDIR\SomePath\$MyLang\&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
(This will copy all the files in the $MyLang directory to the installation directory.)<br />
  CopyFiles &quot;$EXEDIR\SomePath\$MyLang\SomeFile&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
(or this will only copy one file)</div></div><hr />
