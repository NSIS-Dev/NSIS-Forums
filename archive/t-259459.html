<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hbatista</div><div class="date">13th November 2006, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have a button on the installation files page that is only enabled when the installation fails. I'm using the ButtonEvent plugin to detect when it is pressed.<br />
<br />
Now, what I expected was that when I pressed the button, the page 'Leave' function was called and I could detect the click, do my stuff and abort the 'Leave'.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the 'Abort' instruction causes the 'Leave' function to be called (which I did't expect because we stay in the same page, but no big problem), but then when I press the button, the 'Leave' function is never called again! It skips directly to the 'Pre' function of the finish page.<br />
<br />
My workaround was to set a variable when the installation is aborted and if it's set, my 'Leave' function calls 'abort'. This way when I press the button the 'Leave' function is called again (I had to enable the Cancel button manually though).<br />
<br />
Is this behavior by design? It seems quite odd...</div></div><hr />
