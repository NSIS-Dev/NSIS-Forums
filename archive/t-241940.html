<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">27th March 2006, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another sfx package creator written in whole using NSIS scripting lang. Possible benefit from its use is the small size of the sfx container because of its lzma compression and the small NSIS header. Another benefit, hopefully, is its easy of use. Requires an active NSIS installation on the system where compiling the container.<br />

Obviously you're right :-) thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Work in progress. Still to come:<br />
<br />
* Builder<br />
Calculate package's uncompressed size and pass it to extractor.<br />
Check if source path is valid in case a user has typed a path instead of browse by DirRequest.<br />
Check if the source dir is an empty one, thus according to the option include subdirs, if there are subdirs and also if they are empty.<br />
Check if target path is valid (same case as above) and if there is enough space for the container.<br />
Change the radiobutton to checkbox.<br />
<br />
* Extractor<br />
Check if target path has enough space for extraction.<br />
Check if extraction path is valid (same case as above).<br />
Display the estimated disk cost on welcome page.<br />
<br />
Who knows what else.</div></div><hr />

I still refer to my other Wiki pages for code snippets no matter how many Wiki pages I have :S<br />

I have two suggestions for you, if you can implement, would just be awesome.<br />
1&gt; Script it for MUI as well<br />
2&gt; Need a functionality to store password for this SFX like winrar.<br />
<br />
Anyways, keep it up.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">21st October 2006, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback n_baua.<br />
I'm not sure if there is anyone who really needs this utility.<br />
Anyway... I keep it in mind about MUI, when I'll have some extra time I'll work on that.<br />
The utility does not have its own compression method, it just creates a script and calls NSIS for the rest of the job.</div></div><hr />
