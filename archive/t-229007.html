http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/<br />
<br />
still lists 2.07 Beta 0 (May 28, 2005).<br />
<br />
Is this intended, or should it be removed?<br />
<br />
Just a nit, but HTM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">21st October 2005, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">It's intended. There's no reason to hide any version. If someone wants to use an old version, so be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">l_d_allan</div><div class="date">21st October 2005, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Fine with me ... and I can understand this being the case for the &quot;Files&quot; section of the SourceForge project, but it seems odd to have &quot;2.07 Beta 0&quot; showing up on the Summary page.<br />
<br />
AFAIK, it isn't the case that this version is more stable than 2.10 or a &quot;unstable cutting edge version under development with untested features&quot;<br />
<br />
Just a possible nit these eyeballs came across ... doesn't really matter I guess. HTH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">24th October 2005, 03:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, I doubt that anyone cares.<br />
It's just a convenient location to place alpha or beta releases. It so happens that the last such release for 2.07 Beta 0, so it shows up on the main project page.<br />
I suppose it could be hidden, but then someone like me, who likes to have every possible release or pre-release of NSIS for compatability testing (with EclipseNSIS, in my case), would not be able to find it.</div></div><hr />
