<br />
<br />
I had a similar script for this in the past but it is not quite working for this install.<br />
<br />
I have a list (actually a few). that are located on a server. that have a url followed by list of 100's of small files that I need to collect.<br />
<br />
My old system had INI's where there were just a few files so it was easy to manage and download<br />
<br />
the new server just has a text file with all the files listed that I need to grab.<br />
<br />
<br />
[ServerURL]<br />
ww.someserver.com/files<br />
<br />
[Files]<br />
file1.dat<br />
someotherfile.dat<br />
randomename.dat<br />
somthingorother.dat<br />
etc.dat<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas on how to possibly grab the files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QOAL</div><div class="date">18th September 2008, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">You may be interested in a script (well two scripts) I wrote, it goes a bit further than you'd want I guess. (it crc checks the files on the users drive to check if they need updating or not.)<br />
<br />
I'll attach them so you can have a look.<br />
(I left them set up to create a list of files from a local SVN check out of a game I used to work on. And download the update file from localhost and the actual files from the actual SVN.)<br />
<br />
My script uses 2 extra things:<br />
CRCCheck.dll plugin form http://nsis.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/images/f/fd/CRCCheck.zip<br />
RecFind.nsh from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/RecFind:_Recursive_FindFirst,_FindNext,_FindClose<br />
<br />
Basically the Generate_Update_File.nsi script creates a file that lists, recursively, all the files in a given folder and their crc's.<br />
The Updater.nsi downloads this file and checks the users local files to see what needs updating/deleting etc.<br />
<br />
The code might need a bit of cleaning up, but it works.</div></div><hr />

Thanks. I had had not had time to do a thing this last week. I just DL'd it and am going to take a look.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />

I just got time to test your script out.<br />
<br />
Very nice! It is almost exactly what i had in mind. I am sure I could use this script with a few changes. I like the subdirectory searching.<br />
<br />
I did find 2 bugs, 1 minor and 1 major. <br />
<br />
#1 in the build script; It adds the text file itself to the directory list. if I don't manually remove it from the text file, the rest of the download fails after it hits that section.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal, I just have to remember to edit the text file or maybe change the script to create the text file in the $exedir.<br />
<br />
#2 In the download script; This is a bit of a problem. any source file or folder that has a space in it fails to copy.<br />
<br />
The download name/path is correct in the log. but, i get failed download. I took a look all over the script and did not see how to fix that. I did try it on both a UNIX and a windows host to see if maybe it was the %20 missing.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 other things that i did notice that would be of help; <br />
<br />
 1 the option to remove local files if they are not on the host. perhaps a flag to set in the text file.<br />
<br />
 2 this is probably not something that can be changed, all of my INI's (30+) and most of my documentation wants to re-download every time I run it. I can probably find a solution to this.<br />
<br />
I am very impressed by this and I thank you for sharing it. If you have any ideas on the &quot;space&quot; issue, i would love some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QOAL</div><div class="date">30th September 2008, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad you like it. :)<br />
<br />
Okay I've fixed those two bugs now:<br />
It makes sure it doesn't add the updates file to the list<br />
Replaces Spaces with %20, if any other characters need to be made web safe then take a look at line 206 of updater.nsi; copy and edit that line for extra chars.<br />
<br />
To force it to download a file each time, even if it's the same as on disk, change the CRC value in the generated file to something other than the correct value. I have added a check for it being FORCE, which would be better to use since it should be a tiny amount faster and also easier to see what should be always downloaded.<br />
<br />
To make it so you delete a file locally add the file name then 0 on the line below.<br />
You could just make a empty file with the correct name and run the generator, has the same effect<br />
To remove folders do folder name then RMDIR on the line below.<br />
<br />
As for you last point, it should only download files if they have a different CRC than what's in the updates file (aka they have been modified), hrmm.<br />
So maybe an option to just check if a file exists locally and if it does then don't download?<br />
Okay I just added that, you'll have to change the CRC in the generated file to ONCE for each file that needs that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I might be able to do something with arrays so you can list force download (, ignore?) &amp; delete files in a separate file which the generator looks at and merges in to the update list for you. yay/nay? I'll have a play any way.<br />
<br />
Any thing else? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johnm312</div><div class="date">30th September 2008, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I just took a quick look at the update.<br />
<br />
The generator works without a hitch.<br />
<br />
The updater has a new bug. the word replace line for &quot;/&quot; &quot;\&quot; is now ignored, resulting in no downloaded files.<br />
once I rem'd out the %20 line it was back to normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Something minor:<br />
I noticed that the server path has a double // in it. This could have been in the last release and I overlooked it. I added a detailPrint line to show the server path to help debug the %20 error so now I see it.<br />

<br />
<br />
I think the extra backslash is created by the generator by adding a \ before the root files. so far my server could care less and still works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to update it.</div></div><hr />

I tried most of the features in a single run, I than ran it a second time. It still has the issues with the INI files. I can live with that since several do get updated with each update.<br />
<br />
The deletion feature works fine, File/Folder names are resolved that have spaces. the second &quot;/&quot; is fine. <br />

If I do go ahead with this script I'll make sure and credit you (Sorry no royalties, this is freeware).<br />
<br />
You defiantly gave me a useful option and saved me days of pounding my head to a pulp on my desk.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Afterhought]<br />
<br />
I just had a thought about using your logic to create snapshot difference folder. <br />
<br />
Take a snapshot of the virgin game folder; then add whatever user created mods/patches/updates. Take a new snapshot, copying whatever files/folders that are not CRC original to a new folder or zip. Thus creating a user created or custom patch that they can archive or re-apply later. Perhaps this might even save me time in creating my updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton! You defiantly made my day and I appreciate Your help.<br />
<br />
John</div></div><hr />
