<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">13th March 2006, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that HideWindow doesn't always hide the installer window but that using it more than once seems to do the trick. <br />
This was consistently not hiding the window after the MB was dismissed:<br />
<br />
${If} $foo &lt; 100<br />
  MessageBox MB_YESNO &quot;$foo &lt; 100. Would you like to continue?&quot; IDYES yes IDNO no<br />
 no:<br />
  Abort<br />
 yes:<br />
${EndIf}<br />
HideWindow #not getting honored (the following instruction is though)<br />
<br />
But this is working for me:<br />
<br />
${If} $foo &lt; 100<br />
  MessageBox MB_YESNO &quot;$foo &lt; 100. Would you like to continue?&quot; IDYES yes IDNO no<br />
 no:<br />
  Abort<br />
 yes:<br />
  HideWindow #redundant but seems to help<br />
${EndIf}<br />
HideWindow<br />
<br />
So far I haven't had any crashes, so it seems like using multiple HideWindow instructions when the window is already hidden is safe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th March 2006, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">HideWindow calls ShowWindow (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowfunctions/showwindow.asp) with SW_HIDE. There's no problem calling it more than one time.<br />
<br />
It might have not worked after the MessageBox because the window has just received focus. There are some limitations on showing and hiding windows in Windows to avoid annoying the user. For example, the SetForegroundWindow (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowfunctions/setforegroundwindow.asp) function has some of these restrictions.</div></div><hr />

I found every scenario where HideWindow wasn't working and added another call. I have 5 calls for 1 instance where I want to hide the window, and everything works fine now.</div></div><hr />
