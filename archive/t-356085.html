<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">miraz.zaidi</div><div class="date">20th February 2013, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a beginner in NSIS. I want to make an NSIS installer in which I want to open a web page url on which there are some flash games which I want user to play. For this I am using nsWeb plugin but it doesnt seem to support flash files. So I want to know if there is some other plugin available for the same. Also I want to resize the dialog window and the area showing web page to around 600x600. I am able to resize the dialog window using win api's func SetWindowPos but problem is that it is only resizing the outer dialog and not the internal area displaying the web page. So is there any way I can do that. I know we can achieve it using Resource hacker, but I want to know some other way. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

nsWeb plug-in is simply some OLE component based on Internet Explorer - there is no problem with displaying flash files if IE can display them (what problem do you have)?</div></div><hr />

Thanks T.Slappy for your response. Actually I later found out that flash problem is with IE as it doesnt trust the URL I am using, but that can be solved.<br />
Still I am not much sure if resource hacker can do what I want. I tried to use it, but sometimes it damages the exe, so the .nsi doesnt compile. Is it possible that I can delete some contents (like buttons, horizontal seperator) and the code still works. Actually I want to provide a browser like look and feel to the dialog. Any suggestion?</div></div><hr />
