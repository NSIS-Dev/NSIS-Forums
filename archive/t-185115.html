<br />
After creating a lot of product installations for various games, mod's etc, I decided to write this kit for creating basic Self-Installers like that of WinZip and WinRAR (but more beautiful of course :))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just uploaded v0.02, which is at the same download location. The screenshot above is also of the new self-extractor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 02:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the combination of Zip2Exe (and Tga2Exe), this UI design and your easy script manipulation (but I think need some improvements, as I'll say below), and the Context Menu shortcut would be excellent!<br />
<br />
Just some things though:<br />
<br />
1) I think the command names should be in Title Caps and w/o &quot;_&quot; (underscore) characters (like ${SE_FILE} -&gt; ${SEFile}). This will make it more like the NSIS style command names (i.e. SetOutPath).<br />
<br />
2) I didn't understand why put &quot;=&gt;&quot; everytime you insert a File into the list of files to be extracted:${SE_FILE} &quot;local_path_to\file.ext&quot; =&gt; &quot;output_file&quot;As I said before, try to make it like the NSIS command names and parameters styles. It will make the script more compact and easier to produce by hand.<br />
<br />
3) The extractor attributes are mostly in !define style, I suggest to change those into !insertmacro or even normal command styles. And change the position of the !include &quot;SE.nsh&quot; to the beggining of the script.<br />
<br />
(Uhhuuuu! My Internet conection is flying at speed of light now!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions!<br />
<br />
I am still working on adding other bits and bobs. I've allowed for the install details to pop-up over the top.<br />
<br />
Now, I can't find a way to change the style of the first line in the listview. Is it possible? Again I don't have access to a list of defines, and the internet never shows anything that I want!<br />
<br />
Edit: When I place the !include at the top of the script, the header doesn't see the defines below it (because it goes from the top of the nsi script and down, not the other way round). How does MUI fix this?<br />
Edit#2: Ohh I see, it uses macro's not defines!<br />

<br />
I just want to embolden the first line of the details window, where it says &quot;Extraction details&quot;, because that is for the heading (I want it to stand out).<br />
Is it possible?<br />

Is this a Label or a ListBox? If it's a ListBox, you can't put a line with different font from the else. It's ListBox rule.</div></div><hr />

This one includes all the new code, and the &quot;When done, open extraction directory&quot; check-box which replaces the readme check-box if specified. Note that you cannot have both the readme check-box and opendir check-box (that would be anoying for the user if both opened at the same time!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">4th July 2004, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Uploaded a new (perhaps final) build.Oh oh, I've done small tests and I found some more room for improvement:<br />
<br />
Script:<br />
<br />
  1) Major Bug: This one includes ... the &quot;When done, open extraction directory&quot; check-box which replaces the readme check-box if specified Strange. I don't see it.<br />
<br />
  2) Minor Bug: unknown variable/constant &quot;SE_OVERWRITE_STATE&quot; detected, ignoring (macro:SE_FILE:1) When I use the command ${SE-NoOverwrite}.<br />
<br />
  3) Minor bug: When I set ${SE-Font} to a font, it doesn't set the font before the installation to Extract Progress: label control (see on the left of progress bar), but when I start the installation it changes to the correct font.<br />
<br />
  4) Suggestion: Default of ${SE-Product} should be set to the executable file name without its extention.<br />
<br />
  5) Suggestion: Default of ${SE-OutFile} should be set to the script file name changing only the extention.<br />
<br />
  6) Minor Suggestion: In the example script, try to use indentation on the code between ${SE-FilesStart} and ${SE-FilesEnd}.<br />
<br />
Readme:<br />
<br />
  General: You should make some corrections for the changes you've done:<br />
<br />
- ${SE-NoOverwritePrompt} is wrong, the correct is ${SE-NoOverwrite}.<br />
- ${SE-File} parameters are from a previous version.<br />
- If undefined term used for all the old version defines that were changed into commands on this version, change to If not used.<br />
- {SE-NoOpenDir} doesn't exist (because of a checkbox that doesn't exist either).<br />
- And some others that I don't have patience to look for (at this time in the morning - 4:00 AM - what are you expecting me to do?).<br />
<br />
General:<br />
<br />
  1) Major Suggestion: An option to create a Start Menu shortcut folder for the files to be extracted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">4th July 2004, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Okies fixed a lot of the stuff. The reason that you don't have an open-dir check-box is because you cannot have that and a readme check-box. Comment out the readme code and the open-dir check-box will appear. Use ${SE-NoOpenDir} to hide that check-box as well.<br />
<br />
Added new code for shortcuts. No new check-box though, just an optional message box w/ Yes/No.<br />
<br />
How would one get the executable/script file names w/o file extensions on compile time? Remember the Name and Caption are set on compile time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 20:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh oh, again:<br />
<br />
Script:<br />
<br />
1) Minor Bug: ${SE-ExtractListFont} doesn't support multiword font names, like &quot;Times New Roman&quot;.<br />
<br />
2) Minor Bug: ${SE-NoShortcutsMessage} doesn't hide the MessageBox as it should do.<br />
<br />
3) Persistant Bug: unknown variable/constant &quot;SE_OVERWRITE_STATE&quot; detected, ignoring (macro:SE_FILE:1)<br />
<br />
When I use the command ${SE-NoOverwritePrompt}.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for searching for the bugs! I should be more thorough myself, but this is just one of my spair time projects (I'm currently working on a map database website for a Half-Life mod.)<br />
<br />
They should all be fixed now.<br />
The first bug was because I didn't use quotes around the define value.<br />
The second and third bugs were from using !ifdef and !ifndef outside the macro's.<br />
<br />
Uploaded again (still v0.04).<br />
<br />
Edit: Just fixed the small bug where the SE-ExtractListFont wouldn't be set for the extraction details label.<br />

When I look at the screenshots the user interface looks a bit &quot;compressed&quot;, remember that having a smaller window is not always better. Usually some space between controls makes it more user friendly.</div></div><hr />

So changes are not over yet (however you can see that the list of bugs is much smaller than the older lists):<br />
<br />
1) Bug: The readme page is not creating another Internet Explorer window but instead it uses an already existant window. Use an empty string instead of open to use the really default action which is opennew for me.<br />
<br />
2) Script Typo: You doubled the same line ${SE-OutFile} &quot;NSIS Self-Extractor.exe&quot; in the example script.<br />
<br />
3) Minor Bug: When you use a font name with ${SE-ExtractListFont} it appears that the font size becomes smaller. Make sure it looks like the same when not using the command and when using the command w/ &quot;Verdana&quot; (if you can).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I didn't see that before (I only saw it when I opened the Documentation folder, that means I was looking on an older Readme version).<br />
<br />
It's marvelously excellent! I should borrow some of your codes in Javascript and ActiveX. You've done a lot of work to get there. Very good job, man. But just one thing though, why did you put Skip This Step button enabled on Step 3? You can't skip that part because it's essential!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a good point. If you do skip it at the moment, the finish button is disabled (if you do not include a readme as well.)<br />
<br />
I just thought though... I should include the readme with the SE-File macro so that the overwrite prompt (if enabled) shows up.<br />

Perhaps you should force a specific, smaller font for that text? Hmmm, I don't suppose it's easy to have the path changed into using dots in the middle of the string to compact it when it's too long. (like &quot;D:\...\installdir&quot;)<br />

<br />
&lt;RANT&gt;That XP theme has larger controls, meaning less space left for the really important stuff (such as the source windows when I'm programming)&lt;/RANT&gt;<br />
<br />
So, if you want to test yourself, go to your desktop properties and change from windows xp theme to windows classic theme, then you can see for your self (Might be a good idea to save your current theme first, so you can restore it later on)<br />
<br />
Oh, and since it's Windows Classic, it'll probably be using MS Sans Serif, 8 pts for the text. That's what windows usually uses everywhere else. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">7th August 2004, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the appearance could be better:<br />
<br />
- I don't think the &quot;Please enter a directory ...&quot; setence should be with the &quot;Extract to:&quot; label. You should remove one of them.<br />
<br />
- Before &quot;Extract to:&quot; was above the textbox text height, now it's below! You should make it to be in the same height of the textbox text height.<br />
<br />
- Putting the &quot;Please enter a directory...&quot; in bold doesn't make your program looking better in my opinion. I think that's because the first setence is near title of the program which is bold too.<br />
<br />
- This is a very old thing: the ProgressBar and the text on the side positions. ProgressBar should be below the text (you could make the ProgressBar smaller too if you want). This would make the text to have much more space and would make it not to break lines so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">7th August 2004, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;Please enter a directory ...&quot; text is customisable. Like I said, you can use ${SE-ExtractDirTextUnbold}, and set the actual text to whatever you like.<br />
<br />
I will make it unbold default, so instead of ${SE-ExtractDirTextUnbold}, one would have to use ${SE-ExtractDirTextBold} (to make it bold again)<br />
<br />
Good idea on the progress bar :) Currently the progress text is really jumbled up, and when two lines get in it looks messy.<br />
<br />
I'll make the directory box 100% width (without the extract to text) and see what it looks like (with LR padding too of course!) The new text makes the Extract to text redundant now.<br />
<br />
I will make the progressbar thinner, stretch out the white area at the bottom and move the progress text label to 100% width over the top.<br />
<br />
I may also make the spacing under the two checkboxes bigger too (which will make it more spaced out).<br />

This would require a InstallOptions dialogue to be created. You'd be better off incorporating it into the default NSIS system (classic/MUI). See Contrib\InstallOptions.<br />

<br />
Thank for your update.<br />
<br />
1. I am sorry but I have troubles to use it.<br />
Following error occurs, when I start my simple test script testself.nsi starting makensis:<br />

If I am diabling the line :<br />

it's working properly.<br />

<br />
Thank you for the password extension.<br />
Excellent work! <br />
<br />
It would be helpful to another function implemented, like it works in Winzip self extractor.<br />
<br />
It's like the readme function, but<br />
<br />
1. There should be a info text with an enabled button.<br />
e.g. When done decompression starting: setup.exe<br />
<br />
2. This action should start a program (e.g. setup.exe) as last thread after decompressing. Before it is started the main dialogue must be finsihed.<br />
<br />
I can do it with the readme function, but the decompression main dialogue is not diappearing before starting the readme.</div></div><hr />

Re-did the readme file too. Check out Section 4 of the readme for the below which you need to use:<br />

<br />
1. If I am using the password feature the text is wrong:<br />
<br />

<br />
2. If I am using the ${SE-Exec} feature it does only accept one parameter :<br />

!insertmacro: SE_EXEC<br />
!insertmacro: macro &quot;SE_EXEC&quot; requires 1 parameter(s), passed 2!<br />

Sorry, but I found another problem.<br />
<br />
If I am using ${SE-ExecOnClose} the Exec Program is not started. If I am disabling ${SE-ExecOnClose} it works properply.<br />

Regarding second problem. It seems that only 2 check boxes can be active. So I can't add ${SE-OverwritePrompt}, when ${SE-Readme} and ${SE-OverwritePrompt} are inserted.<br />

I did have a few problems when installing a shortcut using a script created by the script generator (which is also very cool)...<br />
<br />
This is what was generated and didn't work:<br />
;- Shortcuts to create<br />
${SE-ShortcutsStart}<br />
  ${SE-Shortcut} &quot;$DESKTOP\Glow Fish 2.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\glowfish2.exe&quot;<br />

  ${SE-Shortcut} &quot;$DESKTOP&quot; &quot;Glow Fish 2&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\glowfish.exe&quot;<br />
${SE-ShortcutsEnd}<br />
<br />
I also had to change &quot;$DESKTOP\Glow Fish 2.lnk&quot;  to &quot;$DESKTOP&quot; since the first created an error when the script tried to install the icon at &quot;$DESKTOP\Glow Fish 2.lnk\Glow Fish 2.lnk&quot; <br />
<br />
The icon on the desktop also was not the one that I specified using ${SE-Icon}, but was instead the icon that appears with the original .exe file (the one specified with &quot;$INSTDIR\glowfish.exe&quot;<br />

any ideas on the whys, and what can be done?<br />

<br />
I may have used ${SE-Shortcut} simply to keep in with the ${SE-[Command]} syntax style, so you could try using CreateShortcut as a complete replacement. See http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.9.3.4<br />

v0.21: Added 'Custom Functions' (see Section 8 in documentation)<br />
Download from same link.<br />
<br />
As for adding extra Self-Extractor code to Zip-To-SE and Dir-To-SE, you just need to put them into the header.nsh files (or you can specify your own header file from the application dialogues).<br />
<br />
Edit: What you need to do is use<br />
${SE-ExtractEndFunc} myFunc<br />
then make a function:<br />
Function myFunc<br />
 ...Put ExecWait (etc) code in here<br />
FunctionEnd<br />

<br />
I am concerned about the securcity of the password protection. Is the exe being encrypted with a standard system( Aes, ...)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">11th April 2005, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">The exe is not encrypted. I don't know how I'd encrypt it even without modifying and recompling NSIS's source?<br />
<br />
I will be adding a ${SE-AddDir} macro which will add a whole directory (with overwrite check-box support.)<br />

This bug wasn't there in v0.21e</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">#{trueparu}</div><div class="date">11th December 2005, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres a very minor bug (if it even is a bug) in the ui, when you use custon windows color schemes. Check the attachment. The area around the &quot;branding text&quot;, is different in colour.<br />
<br />
And also some /solid switch drama. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th December 2005, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello there, thanks for the bug report.<br />
Try the updated version that I have uploaded.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{trueparuex}</div><div class="date">12th December 2005, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope! No luck, still the same. I think you have to remove the SS_WHITERECT flag from that static.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th December 2005, 20:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Try now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{trueparuex'}</div><div class="date">13th December 2005, 08:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, don't work. I din't see any change I see except there are dlg_original.exe (Resource Hacker leftovers I guess) in the package, but the SS_WHITERECT was still there in dlg.exe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">13th December 2005, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Woops my mistake I had the dlg.exe set to read only.<br />
Try now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">13th December 2005, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">:up:  Ok now the UI is OK, but you still need to add...<br />
<br />
GetDlgItem $R1 $R0 10<br />
SetCtlColors $R1 0 FFFFFF<br />
<br />
...To the ReadSettings function. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">14th December 2005, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure?<br />
ReadSettings only gets the states of the check boxes.<br />
<br />
GetDlgItem $R0 $HWNDPARENT 10<br />
SetCtlColors $R0 0 FFFFFF<br />
...is already in .onGUIInit where it needs to be because the control in question is on the outer (parent) dialog.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">14th December 2005, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Well see your self. Happens also in XP.<br />
<br />
The installfiles dialog also haves a 10 control and apparently installfiles dialog overlays the 10 control in the main dialog, because it's bigger that the other dialogs. I tryed first just to remove that control from the installfiles dialog, but that didn't work.<br />
<br />
Edit: Is it just me or is this starting to get a little bit boring? :drool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">14th December 2005, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes very tedious! The problem is that I haven't opened the source file for over a year!<br />
I'll have another look.<br />
<br />
Edit: Fixed now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">14th December 2005, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">:up: Yeah the source is a bit overwhelming, but now It works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">o_owd</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">two questions :<br />
<br />
1. i use ${SE-ForceExec} &quot;setup.exe&quot;. the compiler tells me :<br />
&quot;SE_FORCEEXEC&quot; requires 2 parameter(s), passed 1!&quot;<br />
in your readme file there is only one parameter.<br />
what do i enter for the second one ?<br />
<br />
2. it is posible to begin extraction on extractor initialisation ? without pressing on &quot;extract&quot;.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I'll have a look when I get home.<br />
2. In other words you don't want a directory page (and no check-boxes)?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">o_owd</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">i want the window, but i want the extraction to begin automaticaly (in some cases).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">In ${SE-ForceExec} first parameter is the file and the second is open mode action (&quot;open&quot;, &quot;print&quot;...) it also can be an empty string to use the default action.<br />
<br />
So ${SE-ForceExec} &quot;setup.exe&quot; &quot;&quot; should work just fine.<br />
<br />
Look also the ExecShell function in NSIS manual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks {_trueparuex^}, even I had forgotton what the last parameter was for! I've updated the readme (and changed that ugly colour scheme!)<br />
So you would like to skip the page sometimes or show the page for X seconds before performing the extraction?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">o_owd</div><div class="date">21st January 2006, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">i do not know how to explain this in english. i want the page to appear. not skip it. but i want the extraction to begin automaticaly. not to press on extract !<br />
so, the user double-clicks on the .exe, the window shows up and it extracts already.<br />
something like the downloaded nero burning does.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">21st January 2006, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing I don't understand is how can the user change the extraction location or other options when the extraction has already started?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">21st January 2006, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that o_owd don't know that the extractor actually haves two pages. So there might be misunderstanding about skiping the page.<br />
 	<br />
o_owd the first page is where you set the directory, options and press the extract button and the second page is the one where the progressbar moves and the options and directory field is disabled. Do you want to skip the first page?</div></div><hr />

i feel so stupid....:igor: <br />
i did not knew that it has two pages.<br />
... and yes, i want to skip the first page. sorry for all the trouble.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">21st January 2006, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Try:<br />
${SE_DIRECTORY_PRE_FUNC} SkipDirectoryPage<br />
<br />
Function SkipDirectoryPage<br />
 Abort<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
This may lead to some undesired results as it hasn't been tested but see how it goes. If it doesn't work then I'll probably add a define to the header to disable the page.<br />

<br />
thanks in advance (sorry if my question is ridiculous, I'm just a newbie;) )</div></div><hr />
