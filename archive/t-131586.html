<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cube2</div><div class="date">8th April 2003, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I made some modifications to UpgradeDLL macro:<br />
<br />
- it can be used to upgrade COM exe servers <br />
(server.exe /regserver, server.exe /unregserver)<br />
<br />
- if necessary it set rebootflag to true <br />
(for example after Rename /REBOOTOK )<br />
<br />
- It can be used to upgrade any files (dll, exe, tlb, etc)<br />
  so it can be renamed to upgradeFILE</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ategen</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 00:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, except in is case, I think it does require a reboot.  The file is copied to a temp file name in the details window, which I think is an indication that a reboot is required.  Am I correct, or no?<br />
<br />
If I do the install a single time, I think it does do the renaming on reboot.  However, if I do the install 2x in a row, I get errors on reboot (in a dos window).  I forget the exact text of the error.<br />
<br />
Is there any way for me to have the install generate a detailed log that will give me a clue as to whats going on?  If so, I could maybe attempt to isolate the problem in my install script or in the code on the off chance its in NSIS.<br />
<br />
And don't think I'm cutting on NSIS.  Its the greatest, coolest installer I've used or seen.  I just need this bit to work properly and I'm willing to devote some time and legwork to track down the problem.  Just let me know if there is any information I can collect for myself (or others) that would be useful concerning this issue.<br />

I installed a single time on a clean machine.  It didn't prompt me to reboot and the application worked immediately....<br />
<br />
Is there any way, short of checking registry settings, to see if anything is scheduled for a reboot (like renaming files)?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ategen</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually checking registry settings would be fine too. Would they be in the same place as the register dll command is place when its schedule for a reboot. ....\RunOnce  I believe??<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />
