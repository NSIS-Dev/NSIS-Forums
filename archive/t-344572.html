<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pocruadhlaoich</div><div class="date">2nd May 2012, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
can anyone tell me if it is possible to patch an uninstaller already existing on customer computers?<br />
I have an automatic software update system, and when the new installer gets downloaded by the customer and is run, it will check for a previous installation and if found, will call the existing uninstaller on the computer and uninstall the application prior to the new installer continuing its work.<br />
A bug has been found in the existing uninstaller that is already on customer machines. Since the uninstaller has a bug, I do not want to run it but instead want to replace it with a correct uninstaller. Is it possible for me to have my new installer contain an &quot;Uninstall.exe&quot; such that when the new installer is downloaded and run, that one of the first things it will do in a certain scenario is find and replace the existing bugged uninstaller on the customer's computer with a new bug free uninstaller that has been packaged into the new installer?<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Patrick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">2nd May 2012, 10:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this is possible. Simply compile an nsi with the fixed uninstaller code, run the compiled exe, and keep the &quot;installed&quot; uninstall.exe. Then do File &quot;Path\NewUninstaller.exe&quot; in your actual installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pocruadhlaoich</div><div class="date">2nd May 2012, 11:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi MSG,<br />
thanks for your quick reply! I am trying to understand what it is that you are suggesting:<br />
- if I compile the .nsi then run the compiled .exe, then I will have the bug free &quot;Uninstall.exe&quot; I want on my computer that I wish to put onto the customer's computer<br />
- I then add this uninstaller to my new installer<br />
- my customer downloads the new installer and runs it<br />
<br />
At this point, how do I get &quot;Uninstall.exe&quot; onto the customer's machine at an early stage?<br />
Perhaps if I provide some code it might be better.<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
	Call UninstallPreviousSoftware<br />
	<br />
	InitPluginsDir<br />
	<br />
	#display the language selection dialog<br />
	<br />
	!insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
During .onInit of my installer, I call UninstallPreviousSoftware, a function I created to check for a previous installation and to call its uninstaller. Is is possible for me to put code in .onInit before UninstallPreviousSoftware has been called that will allow me to replace the file?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">2nd May 2012, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Function UninstallPreviousSoftware<br />
${If} ${FileExists} &quot;Some\path\baduninstaller.exe&quot;<br />
  SetOutPath &quot;Some\path&quot;<br />
  File &quot;NewUninstaller.exe&quot;<br />
${EndIf}<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
That's all.</div></div><hr />
