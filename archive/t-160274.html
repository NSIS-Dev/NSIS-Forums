<br />
I'm currently facing a problem with the ExecWait function.<br />
<br />
In my installer I have to invoke a number of deployed binaries. <br />
<br />
I use an ExecWait call that looks like this : <br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;$INSTDIR\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root &lt; $INSTDIR\config\scripts\mysqlgrant.sql&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is that I can see a shell window opening, and a bunch of error messages displayed, just before the window closes. Of course  the closing is very fast, and I don't have the time to read any of the messages.<br />
<br />
I tried to add a 2&gt; $INSTDIR\myerr.log in the exec param, in order to re-direct the stderr and check the errors, but it did not help. The log file was empty.<br />
<br />
I also tried to add &amp;&amp; pause in the <br />
exec line, hoping taht it would prevent the window from closing but without success.<br />
<br />
Eventually I tried to put all these commands in a bat file, and make it exec, but was still unable to find the logs or the errors.<br />
<br />
I also tried some variations of the exec line like : <br />
<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\mysql\bin\mysql.exe&quot; -u root &lt; $INSTDIR\config\scripts\mysqlgrant.sql&quot;'<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
'&quot;$INSTDIR\mysql\bin\mysql.exe&quot; -u root &lt; &quot;$INSTDIR\config\scripts\mysqlgrant.sql&quot;'<br />
<br />
without any success ...<br />
<br />
So dos anyone have a suggestion on how to debug a case like this ?<br />
<br />
Is there any function that would allow me to exec a program and get it's stout &amp; stderr ?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated !<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

See this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=70724&amp;highlight=mysql) for more information.<br />
<br />
You might also want to use nsExec to avoid the pop-up of the command window.</div></div><hr />
