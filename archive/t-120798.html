<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treaz</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Please let me know if this is possible:<br />
<br />
During installation, I wish to get inputs from the user and pass these inputs to a file (packed within the installer - meaning to say this is a file which has been compiled within the installer and would be copied to the target machine after validation) for validation.<br />
<br />
The validation process would require the execution of an external/3rd party application (which can be assumed to exist on the target machine).<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea if this can be done and How can it be done?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Use Exec, ExecWait, ExecShell or nsExec (a plug-in). I would recommend making that executable a plug-in if it's for validation only, will be faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treaz</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I reckon the use of Exec is feasible however, may I know how do it refer to the file that is packed within the installer? As it has yet to be copied into the target machine, $INSTDIR won't work, would it?<br />
<br />
As of now I am still not able to make the file into an executable plugin, so I believe I do not have it as an option yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Extract it to $PLUGINSDIR (initialize it first using InitPluginsDir), and execute it from there. It will be automatically deleted when the installer finishes.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
File thefilename.exe<br />
<br />
or this may even work...<br />
<br />
File /oname=&quot;$PLUGINSDIR/thefilename.exe&quot; thefilename.exe<br />
<br />
I don't have time to check these but you get the general idea. The File command both includes a file AND extracts it, it has a different meaning to makensis than when it is running in the compiled installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Should be:<br />
<br />
File &quot;/oname=$PLUGINSDIR/thefilename.exe&quot; thefilename.exe<br />
<br />
SetOutPath works too.<br />
<br />
Just don't forget to use InitPluginsDir first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treaz</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response.<br />
However, it seems like only SetOutPath works for me. <br />
<br />
File &quot;/oname=$PLUGINSDIR/thefilename.exe&quot; thefilename.exe <br />
doesn't work.<br />
<br />
But since something works.I am fine. Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I said:<br />
<br />
Should be: <br />
<br />
File &quot;/oname=$PLUGINSDIR\thefilename.exe&quot; thefilename.exe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treaz</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 23:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Both ways (\ slash or / slash) didnt work.<br />
But its fine using SetOutPath.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not only the \ it's the quote around the entire thing not just the $PLUGINSDIR\filename.exe.</div></div><hr />
