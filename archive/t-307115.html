<br />
Take, for example, popping up a messagebox -before- the installer UI opens.  If you move to another application while the installer is still launching, you will then get the messagebox, click on it, and... the installer doesn't show up, as it's technically still behind the other window.<br />
<br />
Don't ask me how the heck that happens, but it does (Windows' handling of which application is allowed focus, and when, could use improvement).  When it does, making sure the installer is on top (not at all times, just move it to the top-most z index, as it were) just after such a messagebox has been dealt with, is quite useful.<br />
<br />
That said, I just use the built-in &quot;BringToFront&quot; functionality for that.<br />
<br />
If you do want it on top at all time, I'm with Anders ;)</div></div><hr />
