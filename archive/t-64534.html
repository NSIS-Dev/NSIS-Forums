<br />
just thought i'd throw that one out there...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">2nd November 2001, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Rather than trying to get lots of different projects started, what about everyone deciding on the best scripting engine, which I assume people here think is NSIS, and setup a group of developers to create the ultimate GUI for it. <br />
<br />
That would mean deciding on the language to code it in, spec it, split it up into chunks so that multiple people can work on it, manage the source...<br />
<br />
For the functional spec it may be that you take a commercial product as the basis for what you want to end up with, plus or minus bits and pieces. Don't mean to copy the look of the product but it's features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and i have the perfect way to distro. code to the coders, but that will come later.<br />
