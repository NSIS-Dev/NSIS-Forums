Well, without code or error message to see, seems that you are doing a good job by closing its process.</div></div><hr />

The installer process will terminate automatically as soon as the setup is completed and the user closes the installer window. So what exactly are you doing? Using any special plugins or something? I guess posting your script might also help...</div></div><hr />
