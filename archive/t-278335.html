<br />
I've decided to get back into the NSIS game, and bring my programs up to date with the new NSIS features. However, after downloading both ExperienceUI and UltraMUI, I haven't been able to get things to work correctly.<br />
<br />
First, UltraMUI won't even compile if I try to use the MUI_LANGUAGE macro. Even adjusting the UltraMUI code to skip a certain step, which will make it compile, but I end up with my second issue.<br />
<br />
Common to both skins, I have black bands on certain parts of the UI, or, I have missing UI pieces altogether.<br />
<br />
I tried taking a look at using Wansis and a skin from their library, however, the install file, without any extra plugins or files, is already over 1.5mb. Which, I'm sad to say, is way too big.<br />
<br />
Anybody think they can give me some guidance?</div></div><hr />

You should contact their authors and request a new version.</div></div><hr />
