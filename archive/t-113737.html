<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DragonSoull</div><div class="date">11th November 2002, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my small feature request for all the NSIS2 Developers out there :)<br />
<br />
1) easy to add Start Menu Folder Dialog (maybe in a plugin or a macro?)<br />
- since most users like me are to lame or lazy (or both) to this by them self's<br />
<br />
2) 7z compression it's one of the best format's I know and it's OSS.<br />
- for that really big app that need to be compressed to the max.<br />
<br />
3) $USERDOCS var with points to the user &quot;My Documents.<br />
- I really need this for my Save Games installer's.<br />
<br />
4) dirtree to nsis script File instructions <br />
- because it's a pain to write then when you have to install allot of files :( <br />
<br />
5) improved zip2exe options with: icon, license text, gui and xpstyles picker  <br />
- also for my save games installers :D <br />
<br />
6) !define COMPANY in Modern UI macro system would be nice<br />
- but not really necessary I already worked around it<br />
<br />
That's all I hope you don't find my feature request lame and even include some in the final NSIS2 <br />
<br />
release :)<br />
<br />
PS: The Latest CVS build documentation is terrible please put it back with all chapters and content <br />
<br />
showing in the index (I find it hard to find stuff like it is now)<br />
<br />
Using: NSIS 2.00b0 CVS Build (Today)</div></div><hr />

2) In progress<br />
3) http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/HowToDetermineShellFolderLocations<br />
4) File /r<br />
5) No can do, that's a basic convertor, you want more use the real makensis.exe<br />
<br />
Today is old news ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beaver</div><div class="date">13th November 2002, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">How about and option to backup files to a variable location similar to the $INSTDIR (Maybe $BKUPDIR?) so that when a file is going to be overwriten it will first move it (with recursive) to the $BKUPDIR..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beaver</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In all fairness.... the macro you gave me worked wonderfully... thank you thank you thank you...<br />
<br />
Was just thinking of a feature that could be turned on...<br />
