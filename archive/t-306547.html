<br />
Can anyone post a link or some good practices to follow when you need to create an installer for an application that has 32-bit and 64-bit EXEs?<br />
<br />
Should we create one installer?<br />
<br />
What about naming the EXEs? Should it be myapp.exe and myapp64.exe? or this is completely unecessary as they should be installed under &quot;Program Files (x86)&quot; and/or &quot;Program Files&quot; and have the same name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">20th May 2009, 05:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not seen anything specific to this.  I don't see any harm in having everything in one installation other than doing so may make the installation size a bit larger.  <br />
<br />
You can use the functions inside x64.nsh to determine if running on 64-bit to determine which EXEs to install. (Also, since NSIS is 32-bit, it will try to install things in the 32-bit locations unless you use ${DisableX64FSRedirection}--see the examples in x64.nsh)<br />
<br />
As for naming the EXEs, nothing really special there.  But perhaps from a troubleshooting standpoint, it might make it easy to see the name and know which file is which if the 64-bit version had &quot;64&quot; in the name somewhere.</div></div><hr />
