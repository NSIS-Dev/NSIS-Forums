<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">5th December 2001, 02:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is something bad.<br />
<br />
1) Laptop, after thanksgiving weekend, stoped running. The Hard Drive could not be found and I had lost the entire NSIS Project House site.<br />
<br />
2) I will be going in for surgery next week and I cannot get the site started again.<br />
<br />
So, I am asking you, if you can, could you help me create the site. The requirements are as follows: You need to know how to code PHP-based pages, use and create MySQL tables and produce an great site in little time. I hope to have the site up by New Years, and I will be working on some of the coding. E-mail me if you want to help.<br />

<br />
1) After having surgery, I was rehabbing and I wrote a PHP Script (with the help of Justin ... God He Is great) for a NSI Script Archive. It is now being tested and I will upload some screenies tomorrow.<br />
<br />
2) I might have mentioned this before, but I have created some NSIS Mailing Lists. Now that we are getting lots of people joining the NSIS Revolution, this would be great for people to join.<br />
<br />
There is:<br />
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/nsisphouse-devl<br />
This is for Developers of NSIS products. If you sign up for the non-Batched Digests, you will get up-to-the-minute info on NSIS products from the developers themselves. If you have news on a product, E-mail nsisphouse-devl@lists.sourceforge.net to submit news.<br />
<br />
And:<br />
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/nsisphouse-users<br />
This is for the users of NSIS. The idea for this is to provide information to other developers using NSIS for their installation. <br />
E-mail nsisphouse-users@lists.sourceforge.net to submit news.<br />
<br />
3) SourceForge has been gracious to provide forums for the Project House, but I will use it Only for NSIS Project House Website problems. Any Developer Help will goto this forum.<br />
<br />
Any other help, you may e-mail me at duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net<br />

<br />
After much careful consideration ... I have decided to not take an advisory role in the Website for NSIS Project House. I am still going to be the project admin, but I will just be looking in and helping with problems and I will be writing documents for the help on NSIS. This news has not been told to anyone and in fact, this will be the first time anyone will know this. This news comes with the new Admin to the project, our own Koen van de Sande. He has and will continue to work on the website. He has been given Webmaster Admin status with some restrictions. Hopefully he will take the project website and make it much better than what I can give you guys. On a plus side, Koen has made an barebones website that will continue to grow. If you want to see it, goto http://nsisphouse.sourceforge.net/website.php .<br />
<br />
Enjoy,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">1st January 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I would just use a prebuilt site like PostNuke (http://www.postnuke.com) .  That way, the site will be easy to maintain.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">1st January 2002, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know about PostNuke, don't know what it is. Anyway, yes I'm writing the scripts for the site. Once that is done I'm not sure if I'll be able to do much due to time limits. But I hope to get the bulk of the site ready before the end of my holiday.<br />
<br />
Happy New Year everyone! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">2nd January 2002, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">postnuke and phpnuke is a cool cms<br />
u don't need to code (only if u want)<br />
but u will need a mysql database<br />
<br />
if u have one then its easy<br />
there is a memberarea included <br />
and u have modules like a forum and much more<br />
<br />
u can choose themes and make also your own<br />
<br />
i have set up a site with phpnuke and this works fine<br />
<br />
maybe its a little bit too big ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">2nd January 2002, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, what we needed was a database of NSIS projects and I know that PHPNuke doesn't have the ability to do what we wanted to do. If it were that easy, I would have put it on there and that would be it, but I wanted something more personal and appealing ... Thanks though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 08:35</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah u have to code a php module for a cvs like database bec. the default download  module is not so good<br />
