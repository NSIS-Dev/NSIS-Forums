I really like NSIS<br />
But this BBS is English!<br />
It's hard to read!<br />
So I want to create a Chinese BBS for NSIS that Chinese User can talk about NSIS!<br />
Webmaster, what do you think about it?<br />
<br />
Please contact me<br />
My e-mail is webmaster@tecrc.com<br />
My BBS is http://bbs.tecrc.com<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a good idea. Let me know if it sticks and I'll add it to community (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Community) page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wxzbb</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I have created it! It's just in the http://bbs.tecrc.com<br />
You can see a part named NSIS å®˜æ–¹ä¸_æ–‡è®ºå› (these're Chinese)<br />
That's it!<br />
What about it?<br />
Please contact me quickly!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wxzbb</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The Chinese can't show correctly in English NSIS BBS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see two forums with NSIS in their name.<br />
<br />
I don't know why this forum can't display Chinese, but that's what the Chinese forum is for, isn't it? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wxzbb</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">My BBS is just about Tech and software and program<br />
I think it's an good idea!<br />
What do you think about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wxzbb</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">There're three forums about NSIS now!<br />
One is NSIS-discuss<br />
One is NSIS-Bug-report<br />
Another is NSIS-Help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">That's great. Let me know when it starts getting alive and I'll add it to the community page.<br />
<br />
I don't think a bug report forum would be a good idea though, unless someone will forward reports from there to us. None of the developers knows Chinese.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wxzbb</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">And something other,<br />
I want to get your permission to make NSIS Chinese Version<br />
<br />
NSIS Chinese BBS can start now!<br />
But please tell me some tips to make more people to visit<br />
and something like FAQs and so on that I can answer other people's question.<br />
<br />
And please send a news on this web that NSIS Chinese Has created!<br />
That will help me to tell people about NSIS Chinese BBS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need my permission to create a Chinese version. It's allowed by the license. There was already a Chinese version made by KiiAli. Google for CPatch and NSIS and you should find it.<br />
<br />
I don't know how to get people to visit. You'd probably want to let some Chinese developer forums know about it. There's a FAQ (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FAQ) on the website you can translate.<br />
<br />
As for posting it on this website, I really prefer posting links to well-established forums. I've already had a few international forums that just died out after a few weeks, even with the links, without any prior notice causing dead links or even spam links. But I'll see where something might be added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wxzbb</div><div class="date">1st July 2007, 04:12</div></div><div class="posttext">My BBS is good. It won't die<br />
Believe me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wang1</div><div class="date">29th December 2008, 06:48</div></div><div class="posttext">So useful information, I will transfer it to my beijing friends, They need it in Chinese translation (http://www.TopChineseTranslation.com)</div></div><hr />
