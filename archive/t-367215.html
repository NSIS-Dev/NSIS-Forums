<br />
I have two installers that show the same behavior: (both NSIS 2.46)<br />
The phase where files are being extracted to the installation directory is awfully long under Windows 8 (32/64 bit) compared to previous Windows versions.<br />
e.g. a 620 KB installer unpacking about 1MB of files (total) takes up to 12s to do this before starting the next action/section whereas under Windows 7 (same machine) unpacking is performed in less than a second. (Detailprint for that action is visible together with the GUI appearing after start, on Win8 one can read the &quot;Extracting files....&quot; and wait until the next section does a DetailPrint. <br />
<br />
I have already moved from compression lzma /SOLID to lzma only, but no change.<br />
I also tried NSIS 3.0a0 with manifest for Win8 - no change.<br />
<br />
The installer where speed is important (10-13s overhead) already has the manifest for Win8 added using MTTool.<br />
<br />
Can anybody explain why NSIS under Windows 8  is so much slower extracting files?<br />
Is there solution/workaround?</div></div><hr />

<br />
- SetCompress off   doesn't help neither<br />
- Yes, the installer gets signed with a real VeriSign signature<br />
 <br />
I'll try to reduce it to an installer just unpacking the files and printing the time consumed after start....</div></div><hr />

<br />
my answer: NO and YES.<br />
<br />
NO - We did not install any AV program<br />
YES - But Windows 8 includes Windows Defender, which does real-time checking of EXE and archive files....<br />
<br />
So you solved the mystery!<br />
Thanks!<br />
