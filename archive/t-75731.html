<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thward</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 03:13</div></div><div class="posttext">:igor: I have a NullSoft file from nextwish.org which I am trying to open into a new folder without installing it in the program it is supposed to modify (Half-Life Counter-Strike). However, the file seems to know when I am not setting it to unzip into the real Half-Life directory, because any attempt to unzip it in a dummy directory path doesn't work. I read on the NSIS homepage that the NSIS packing user can set up the NSIS so that the unpacker cannot modify the file path from a designated registry key. Is there any way I can modify the file with NSIS so I can unpack the docs in a folder of my choosing?:)</div></div><hr />

Maybe it helps if you use the command line switch for assigning the directory:<br />
<br />
e.g. mynsis.exe /D=c:\temp<br />
<br />
<br />

Nope.  It just gives me that address at the installation directory prompt. However, the &quot;Next&quot; button is grayed out, just like when I typed in my chosen directory at the installation prompt. Nice thought, though. :cry:</div></div><hr />

<br />
try fooling the install by changing the RegSetting of Counter-Strike to the dir you want to extract to. Maybe that will help. But it's possible that the install also performs a file check. Then it's not possible using this method, because the extract dir does not contain files (maybe copy them before trying to install???)<br />
<br />
Give it a try, good luck,<br />

Messing with the registry settings might be dangerous, although I guess I can back it up. If I did change the reg setting though, I think the best way to go is what you suggested in the alternative. If I take out the HL/CS registry key, I can install HL/CS wherever I want, and a new key will be created. I can then install the NextWish prog with NullSoft, check it out, and then delete the clone HL/CS installation. If I then reload the old registry settings, I should be fine. What a pain in the ass, but the guy at NextWish who used NSIS to compact the HL/CS program doesn't respond to my e-mails. Oh, well . . .:p</div></div><hr />

Good luck, greetz from Holland,<br />
