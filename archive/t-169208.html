<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shantanu_gadgil</div><div class="date">13th February 2004, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if there could be a NSIS Designer.<br />
<br />
The first few thoughts in my mind are:<br />
1. We can load the UI.exe that we want, and then we click on the specific location; texts, icons, progress-bar, etc. and change their properties; (choose the text from a file/type the text, choose the icon from a file, the progress-bar will be smooth/colored, etc.<br />
<br />
2. Wouldn't NSIS be really succesful if all(beginners as well as advanced users) were using it ?!? :)<br />
<br />
3. The &quot;designer&quot; would really simplify the job of customizing the look of the installer.<br />
<br />
4. How about it ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The attached EXE is just a sample of what the program should be able to do.<br />
<br />
Check it out and tell me what you feel.<br />
<br />
The EXE is a VB6 exe. Hope you have VB6 installed on your system :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) Use HM NIS Edit to create custom pages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shantanu_gadgil</div><div class="date">13th February 2004, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">No..No.. :), I don't want to modify the dialog properties. I just want to modify the existing (user changeable) options, like the &quot;LicenseText&quot;, &quot;BrandingText&quot; etc. but in a GUI manner.<br />
<br />
The user will click on the location of the &quot;BrandingText&quot; (default is NSIS Install System...) and then he/she can modify it to whatever he/she wants. Basically the user will be able to to these modifications and see how they will look, at the same time.<br />
<br />
This might save the user from having to recompile, if he/she wants some minor GUI change !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">13th February 2004, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The GUI can be changed as described above. All texts are in the langauge files and can be changed using a simple command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shantanu_gadgil</div><div class="date">14th February 2004, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I know how to change the texts, icons etc with their specific commands.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is that a &quot;designer&quot; will not make a NEW USER hunt for which command exactly is for what.<br />
<br />
Something &quot;wizardy&quot; for the UI.<br />
<br />
Am I still being confusing ? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">14th February 2004, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Most users don't have to change any texts, but you can extend existing script generation wizards with text settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shantanu_gadgil</div><div class="date">15th February 2004, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I agree :) but only partly :) !<br />
<br />
This software (if written :) ) would primararily be for * NEW USERS *.<br />
<br />
Just so that they do not feel as if they have to crawl on their elbows and knees to modify that small setting here and there?<br />
<br />
Agree ?</div></div><hr />
