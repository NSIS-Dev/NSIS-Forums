<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm experiencing a hang when my installer hits a custom page I've added in. My script first checks to see if a URL is appended to the end of the installer. If it isn't there I want the enter a URL dialog should show up. It doesn't hang if I've inserted the URL at the end of the installer but it does if it isn't there. I've attached my shortened test script and the custom page InstallOptions INI file. I also found a InstallOptions.dll with some debug stuff in it so I ran it with that and used DebugView to capture those results. I included the LOG of that in the zip also. I'm sure this is something I'm doing wrong but I'm not seeing it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought that too but if I put message boxes in to test my values and to see how far it's getting it doesn't hang for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Test the INI file using a simple script without any other code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The INI file by itself always worked fine but when I had all the other code it would hang. Like I said before with message boxes it ran fine so that makes it really hard to debug. So, I ended up replacing GetFirstStrPart and Trim with StrStr and TrimNewlines. I had to change some code in my custom function CustomPageEnterURL but now it seems fine. I got all of those other functions from the Useful Functions archive so I doubt they are bad. I must have just been doing something weird. Thanks for the help again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crisp</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello.<br />
I have the same problem with   Banner::show  and   Banner::distroy. <br />
Sometimes the installer hangs at banner:distroy. If I put a message between sho and distroy it's not hanging anymore.<br />
I wanted to post some code in the forum, but because I could not reproduce it in a small example, I've prefered to just put a 'stupid' info message to get rid of the banner and go on with the flow of the installer.<br />
I thougth that this is a banner issue but it seems not.<br />
Maybe I will find some time to redesign the script. I'm sure that if I will start from scratch I will not have this problem anymore.<br />
If I will reproduce it in another script I will post the code here.<br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe somebody has a clue about this.</div></div><hr />
