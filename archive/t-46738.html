<br />
I'm writing to find out what everyone is doing when they install dll files.  This seems to be a basic need of almost any installer, so I'm surprised that NSIS doesn't have it incorporated yet.  I really like this installer, so I would like to get this feature incorporated somehow.  I read the post that suggested creating a separate executable to check the version and then create a file called newer.txt if necessary.  NSIS could then check to see if the newer.txt file exists and then perform the correct action.  <br />
<br />
While this solution works, I feel that it's very inefficient.  Are there any plans to add version checking?  I saw some code to do this in the form of a patch file a while back, but I can't find it anywhere.  Plus, I'm not sure how to apply a patch to source files in Visual C++.  <br />
