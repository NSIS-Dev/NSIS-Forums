i know that there is plugin zipdll for unzipping from zip file during installation, but is tere aslo a plugin/program for zipping?<br />
<br />
well, i have used WinZip Command Line Support Add-On, which does all that, but it has some maior disadvantages:<br />
-it requires WinZip 8.0 or higher<br />
-and itself<br />
so if someone wants to use my program, he also needs to install and register winzip 8.0 or higher, and afther that WinZip Command Line Support Add-On. So that isn't exactly what i'm looking for.<br />
<br />
so i'm looking for solution for zipping like unzipping with zipdll</div></div><hr />
