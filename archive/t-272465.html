<br />
I'm new to the installer world and I have to create an installer that connects to a remote service for license key authentication and some other content (links to other 3rd  that are required but cannot be bundled with the application).<br />
<br />
I do not want to bundle the links with the installer since they'll quickly become outdated. Providing these links in the installer is a mandatory requirement for it.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if NSIS can handle these requirements and if you have some pointers to documentation relevant for this.<br />
<br />
Your help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">7th June 2007, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">You will have to have at least one hard coded link in your installer. This would point to a remote INI file containing all the other links.<br />
<br />
Use the InetC plug-in (http://nsis.sf.net/Inetc_plug-in) to download files.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mleica</div><div class="date">8th June 2007, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply afrow. What about the remote license key authentication? Is there any way to connect to a remote service? (SOAP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">9th June 2007, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can do this through a web executable (written in PHP for example) then you can pass data onto it using InetC and POST.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mleica</div><div class="date">11th June 2007, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! If I use an HTTP POST to post the license key from the client(installer) to the web executable what options would I have for the response? (i.e. how do I respond to the installer to tell it whether the key was validated or not?)<br />
<br />
Also if you have code snippet for how the installer part would look(passing the license key from the installer to the validator using InetC) or a pointer to something similar that would be great!<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th June 2007, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">The POST string is the same as a GET string, for example:<br />
&quot;key=$R0&quot;<br />
Then in PHP it would be $_POST['key'].<br />
<br />
As for returning output, you simply echo it. InetC downloads the output as plain text (you should use header('Content-Type: text/plain') in PHP to be sure) and so you just open the file with FileOpen, FileRead and FileClose.<br />
