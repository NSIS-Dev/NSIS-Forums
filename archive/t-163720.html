<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a problem using LangString:<br />
<br />
1. define a variable using LangString for language LANG1<br />
2. start the installer and choose LANG2 using MUI<br />
3. strings show in System language, not the LANG2, the one chosed on startup (fortunately, it was LANG1).<br />
4. when tried on a computer that has a different default language (LANG3), the strings were empty.<br />
<br />
Note that there were no strings defined for LANG3.<br />
<br />
It is terribly annoying seeing that, after choosing a language on the startup of the installer, the LangStrings show in the system's language.<br />
<br />
What happens if the strings for a language (doesn't matter the way the language is checked) are not defined - running the installer on a system with LANG3, LANG3 chosen on startup, but no LangStrings defined for LANG3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">the script is quite big.<br />
here's a small script that has the same problem<br />
<br />
--- SCRIPT ---<br />
!include &quot;MUI.nsh&quot;<br />
<br />
  Name &quot;testLangString&quot;<br />
  OutFile &quot;testLangString.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Polish&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Romanian&quot;<br />
<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_LANGDLL<br />
<br />
  LangString VAR1 ${LANG_POLISH}  &quot;POLISH is set&quot;<br />
  LangString VAR1 ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;ENGLISH is set&quot;<br />
<br />
Section dummy<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK $(VAR1)<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
--- END SCRIPT ---<br />
<br />
Questions: <br />
1. My system is set to English. When I choose Polish, I see the English message. Shouldn't I see the Polish one?<br />
2. Shouldn't there be a default language when I choose &quot;Romanian&quot; for example? I'd like to see English by default for example.<br />
As a side effect to 1, if the system has a language that does not have a corresponding LangString, the variable won't contain any of the strings, it would be null.<br />
If I don't have a default lang for langstrings, I have to use preinitialized variables and that change WHEN the langstring variable is not null.</div></div><hr />

1. You can't use language strings in .onInit, the language is initialised after .onInit.  <br />
Hmm.. I have message boxes in .onInit that need translation (warning for multiple installer sessions, close specific application and so on).<br />
Ok.. assuming I move *all* the code from onInit, which is the next function which is called (before showing any PAGEs) that has the language strings enabled?<br />
<br />

How come?<br />
StrCpy ${VAR1} &quot;text&quot; ? or<br />
StrCpy $(VAR1) &quot;text&quot; ? or.. some other method?<br />
<br />
P.S.:<br />
(1) &amp; (2) should be documented.. somewhere. (I don't think I've missed something about LangStrings in the docs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s793016</div><div class="date">8th January 2004, 06:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, my English is very poor.<br />
<br />
If your first page is &quot;page license&quot;, use &quot;PAGE license FunctionNameHere&quot; to   defined that page, before &quot;License&quot; page show, NSIS will call Function &quot;FunctionNameHere&quot; first.<br />
<br />
And you could put your warning or something inside Function &quot;FunctionNameHere&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">8th January 2004, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">You should set a language string for all langauge, you haven't got one for Romanian.<br />
<br />
The first function called for visible installers is .onGuiInit / Modern UI custom GUIINIT. For silent installers it's the section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">8th January 2004, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">OK.. so, here's how I fixed my script:<br />
<br />
I wanted to add some languages to the installer (NSIS default language tables) although I didn't have LangStrings for all, and I got to the next situation:<br />
<br />
StrCpy $LSTR_CURRENTUSER  &quot;Current User&quot;<br />
StrCmp $(STR_CURRENTUSER) &quot;&quot; +2<br />
 StrCpy $LSTR_CURRENTUSER $(STR_CURRENTUSER)<br />
<br />
So, in this case, I replaced the use of $(STR_CURRENTUSER) with $LSTR_CURRENTUSER. It isn't really elegant, it isn't elegant at all since I have 16 localized strings (for now).<br />
<br />
How could I write a macro that does those comparisons?<br />
I gave it a shot, but it seems I don't handle properly all the variables sent as params. I'd like it to be something like<br />
!insertmacro INIT_STRING $VARIABE $(LANG_STRING) $OTHER_STRING<br />
; the macro would basically assign to VARIABLE the value of  LANG_STRING if it's not null or OTHER_STRING otherwise<br />
<br />
Is there a way to call the value of $(STR_CURRENTUSER) for a specific language, something like $(STR_CURRENTUSER[$LANG_ID])? (sugestion)<br />
It would be a lot easier for me to call the previous macro like: <br />
!insertmacro INIT_STRING $LSTR_VAR1 $(VAR1) $(VAR1[$LANG_ENGLISH])<br />
<br />
10x for your help<br />
<br />
p.s. i'll look into moving the code to .onGuiInit</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea. 10x<br />
I understood how to solve the problem with the initialization of the strings, but I still need to find a fast way of assigning some strings to empty langstring variables. The reason for this is that I want to include with my installer more (NSIS default) languages and, at the same time, use the localized installer strings for some of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you will have to create a macro that sets the default strings.</div></div><hr />

The Macedonian NSIS translation looks the same and it has the same charset as the translations I use, but when loaded, the langstrings I use appear using latin1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th January 2004, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean that all standard strings work fine but langauge string not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">12th January 2004, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly.<br />
Assuming that the charset is wrong, where do I set it?<br />
What charsets are used in LangStrings?<br />
Is it anywhere written what charsets there must be used for specific languages?<br />
<br />
(why isn't utf8 used?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th January 2004, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">UTF8 is not used because it's only supported by Windows 2000/XP. NSIS is designed to work with all major Windows versions.<br />
<br />
I've updated the Macedonian language file with a code page (1251), try it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">12th January 2004, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Comment: The NSIS default installer strings looked great (in case you have changed the default lang file, please undo - it looked great before - or... it might look great now too, but... does it change in any way what charset I use for modifying own LangStrings?).<br />
<br />
The LangStrings I define appear in the wrong way and I can't alter(define) the charset - I don't even know what charset is.<br />
<br />
My problem shortly: what charset should I use for the Macedonian LangStrings so that display correctly, just like the NSIS translation?<br />
<br />
Is the charset different for each language? If yes, where are the charset assignments for each language defined?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have now added the code page, please try whether that solves your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">13th January 2004, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.. the problem is that, using the latest nightly build, my installer looks horrible. The text is converted to RightToLeft, no language is auto-detected on start (the dropdown is empty, it had English autoselected before).<br />
<br />
I still have to figure out why it's not working. Trying previous versions with the current translation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">13th January 2004, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">My mistake. Still testing. I'll have some feedback regarding the latest changes in the translation shortly.<br />
<br />
It seems that the compiler does not work properly (the output executable is corrupted - segfaults, no default language selected etc.) when an AntiVirus monitor is running in background - maybe a warning could be put somewhere to prevent this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">13th January 2004, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We have never had any reports of incompatibilities with anti-virus software.

Make sure you are doing nothing else wrong and attach your script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceRAM</div><div class="date">13th January 2004, 21:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Found a strange behaviour when loading languages.<br />
I have to mention that I used NSISrc2 with the new Macedonian language updates.<br />
<br />
This is part of my installer script:<br />
  !insertmacro UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD &quot;English&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD &quot;Dutch&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD &quot;Macedonian&quot;<br />
  <br />
;  !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;French&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;SimpChinese&quot; <br />
<br />
If I leave it as you see it, the installer crashes when it loads (Windows displays that dialog containing &quot;Would you like to Debug....&quot;).<br />
<br />
If I uncomment French, it works ok. I don't know why. Maybe the language files have something in them that does not work properly.<br />
<br />
Still didn't check if the Macedonian LangStrings look ok.<br />
Note: UI_LANGUAGE_LOAD is a macro that loads MUI_LANGUAGE and the LangStrings for a specific language (availaible on the NSIS site archive).</div></div><hr />
