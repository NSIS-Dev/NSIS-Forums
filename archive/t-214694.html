I see that you implemented a string length limit on the input box--very nice!:D <br />
<br />
I also like the registration screens--they are simple and very functional. :cool: <br />
<br />
But there's one minor thing:<br />
In the help manual under the FAQ section, you have what appears to be a link:<br />
...read this tutorial about functions and params.<br />
<br />
The word 'this' looks like a hyperlink, but doesn't really do anything.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Comperio!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your comments! :)<br />
Actually, that's not a bug... is only a underlined word :P<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">30th April 2006, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Plugin updated :)<br />
<br />
Added the option to multiple file selection. See OpenBox-4.nsi.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rxs2k5</div><div class="date">1st May 2006, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm I notice your keyegn for this dialogsexplugin is weird now, would it be possible to make the keygen to generate more randomly ???<br />
<br />
this is the current one<br />
&quot;FFFFFF0031-727-32-1-6&quot;<br />
<br />
I was thinking could it be possible to make the keygen serial to like this<br />
<br />
&quot;xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx&quot;<br />
<br />
Plus this could allows a inputreg more complicated.<br />
<br />
thanks for this great plugin</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nuljet</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 02:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for this plugin... was banging my head in docs trying to find such capabilities.<br />
<br />
A remark about ModernFolderBox though:<br />
<br />
When I decide to create a new folder, two options are offered to name it, as usual: in the path itself at bottom of the dialog; and in the tree itself, by double-clicking icon.<br />
But in any of these ways, two folders are created: one that we have just named, and another called &quot;New Folder&quot;.<br />
Having just one folder created by clicking OK would be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 22:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, see the Open and SaveBoxes example files about file paterns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 04:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Joel,<br />
I found a couple issues, both using the File Save exmple 3 (SaveBox-3.nsi included with your plugin.)<br />
<br />
First issue:<br />
Compile and run the stock saveBox-2.nsi script.  I find that each time I type in a unique file name or pick an existing file, the script tells me that the operation was cancelled.<br />
<br />
Second issue: (might be related to the first)<br />
The stock script uses the variable ${Var_9} as the return varible and the style &quot;3&quot; which gives the modern XP save as dialog.  But, if I modify the script to use ${Var_1} instead (leaving the type set to &quot;3&quot;), then it starts using the old (Win3.1) style save box.  If I then change to ${Var_2}, then I get the Win9x type save box.  In all cases, I get &quot;operation was cancelled&quot;.  <br />
<br />
It appears as if the return variable seems to control the type setting instead of the value of the actual type parameter.<br />
<br />
(For reference, I'm using XP SP2 with NSIS version 2.22)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll check that...<br />
due my teacher schedule (finals in the semester) I can do it quickly as I'd like, but I'll find the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">6th December 2006, 05:26</div></div><div class="posttext">No hurry.  I'm getting by just fine using your original  dialogs (http://plugins.joelito.********descargas.php?file=dialogs.zip) plugin.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomfra</div><div class="date">20th December 2008, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have a copy of the DialogsEX plugin? The original link is no longer working and in the NSIS plugin directory I found only the Dialogs plugin which I suppose is an older/less advanced version.<br />
<br />
I mostly need the Modern Folder function which is not available in the Dialogs plugin.<br />
<br />
Is there an alternative download link somewhere?<br />

The only link I found in the wiki is nsis.sourceforge.net/Dialog****plug-in and there is no direct download link in there. Just the URL to your website but that's no longer working.<br />
