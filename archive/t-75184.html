I have taken the example1.nsi with only a little modification. Here is the problem:<br />
<br />
; example1.nsi<br />
;<br />
; This script is perhaps one of the simplest NSIs you can make. All of the<br />
; optional settings are left to their default settings. The instalelr simply <br />
; prompts the user asking them where to install, and drops of notepad.exe<br />
; there. If your Windows directory is not C:\windows, change it below.<br />
;<br />
<br />
; The name of the installer<br />
Name &quot;Example1&quot;<br />
<br />
; The file to write<br />
OutFile &quot;example1.exe&quot;<br />
StrCpy $1 C:\Program Files\ICQ<br />
; The default installation directory<br />
InstallDir $1<br />
<br />
; The text to prompt the user to enter a directory<br />
DirText &quot;This will install the very simple example1 on your computer. Choose a directory&quot;<br />
<br />
; The stuff to install<br />
Section &quot;ThisNameIsIgnoredSoWhyBother?&quot;<br />
  ; Set output path to the installation directory.<br />
  SetOutPath $1<br />
  ; Put file there<br />
  File &quot;C:\windows\notepad.exe&quot;<br />
SectionEnd ; end the section<br />
<br />
; eof<br />
<br />
ok, I will Install a ICQ Plugin to the directory C:\Program Files\ICQ but I will not use the variable $PROGRAMFILES<br />
<br />
And here the Error when I compile it:<br />
<br />
Processing script file: &quot;example1.nsi&quot;<br />
Name: &quot;Example1&quot;<br />
OutFile: &quot;example1.exe&quot;<br />
StrCpy $1 &quot;C:\Program&quot; (Files\ICQ) ()<br />
Error: Can't add entry, no section or function is open!<br />
Error in script &quot;example1.nsi&quot; on line 14 -- aborting creation process<br />
<br />
The Big Problem is this here: <br />
StrCpy $1 &quot;C:\Program&quot; (Files\ICQ) ()<br />
<br />
normal the line should look like this:<br />
StrCpy $1 &quot;C:\Program Files\ICQ) ()<br />
<br />
thx for help</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your English is fine, but you have more than just a directory problem. ;)<br />
<br />
First of all, the compiler is failing because you have a StrCpy instruction outside of a section. You can't mix instructions in with installer attribute definitions - instructions like StrCpy can only be used in Sections or Functions.<br />
<br />
Secondly, any path that has spaces must be enclosed in quotes, e.g. &quot;C:\Program Files&quot;<br />
<br />
I have modified the script you posted so that it 'works' and puts notepad.exe in C:\Progam Files\ICQ... You really ought to disable directory selection if you don't want the end user to choose the destination directory.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope the changes I have made are evident to you - I defined INSTALLPATH to allow you to easily change the path, quoted the path, and that's pretty much it.<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest you read the NSIS documentation (NSIS\makensis.htm &amp; NSIS\functions.htm) very carefully, and go through the examples line by line and see how they work. It's very straightforward after you make that initial investment. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck. :up: <br />
<br />
!define INSTALLPATH &quot;C:\Program Files\ICQ&quot;<br />
<br />
; The name of the installer<br />
Name &quot;Example1&quot;<br />
<br />
; The file to write<br />
OutFile &quot;example1.exe&quot;<br />
; The default installation directory<br />
InstallDir &quot;${INSTALLPATH}&quot;<br />
<br />
; The text to prompt the user to enter a directory<br />
DirText &quot;This will install the very simple example1 on your computer. Choose a directory&quot;<br />
<br />
; The stuff to install<br />
Section &quot;test&quot;<br />
; Set output path to the installation directory.<br />
SetOutPath &quot;${INSTALLPATH}&quot;<br />
; Put file there<br />
File &quot;C:\windows\notepad.exe&quot;<br />
SectionEnd ; end the section<br />
<br />
; eof</div></div><hr />

<br />
A small suggestion - I'm not sure if this example is just for learning or you intend to use it. If it's for learning, that's great. :) If you intend to use it, I would suggest you change the following line:<br />
SetOutPath &quot;${INSTALLPATH}&quot;<br />
<br />
to this:<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
That way the installer will actually use the directory selected by the user... ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, take care. :)</div></div><hr />
