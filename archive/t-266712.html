This is a really simple question since I'm a complete beginner.<br />
I have two sections, both selectable.<br />
In the Uninstaller section I'd like to know which sections were selected, in order to uninstall the appropriate parts for each selected section.<br />
I tried to use global variable (getting diffrent value in each section), or using SectionGetFlags and it always uninstalled both sections' parts, regardless of my choice.<br />
How can I do it.<br />
Thanking you all.<br />
Dilbertz</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the quick answer.<br />
The registry trick works of course.<br />
Found it few hours ago but it still seems weird that there is no other way to connect between installer sections and uninstall section.<br />
By the same token you can open a file in each installer section and check its existence in the uninstall section.<br />
This is clumsy as well.<br />
thanks again.<br />

For instance, you may combine the registry thing with a components uninstall page which should read the registry and turns installed sections as checked ready for uninstall.<br />
Doing that, you're offering the ability to uninstall parts of your software or uninstall completely.<br />
For my opinion these are flexible and pro capabilities offered by NSIS.</div></div><hr />
