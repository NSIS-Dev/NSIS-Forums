<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eagle3386</div><div class="date">11th January 2009, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I came across the problem within my NSIS-script which happens whenever the user launches the (un)installer twice.<br />
Thanks to the Wiki, I found the solution (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Allow_only_one_installer_instance), but even the â€œeven more advancedâ€ example BringToFront<br />
<br />
# Check if already running<br />
# If so don't open another but bring to front<br />
System::Call &quot;kernel32::CreateMutexA(i 0, i 0, t '$(^Name)') i .r0 ?e&quot;<br />
Pop $0<br />
StrCmp $0 0 launch<br />
StrLen $0 &quot;$(^Name)&quot;<br />
IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br />
loop:<br />
 FindWindow $1 '#32770' '' 0 $1<br />
 IntCmp $1 0 +3<br />
 System::Call &quot;user32::GetWindowText(i r1, t .r2, i r0) i.&quot;<br />
 StrCmp $2 &quot;$(^Name)&quot; 0 loop<br />
 System::Call &quot;user32::ShowWindow(i r1, i 9) i.&quot;         ; If minimized then maximize<br />
 System::Call &quot;user32::SetForegroundWindow(i r1) i.&quot;     ; Bring to front<br />
 Abort<br />
launch: doesnâ€™t work â€” no matter if I modify â€œIntCmp $1 0 +5â€ to â€œ+4â€ (or even â€œ+3â€) or not.<br />
<br />
By â€œdoesnâ€™t workâ€, I mean that thereâ€™s only _one_ installer launched, but that one _never_ gets brought to the front or maximized (when previously minimized, of course).<br />
<br />
The test bed consists of Vista Business x64 with myself having administrative rights, several entries at the taskbar and HM NIS Edit 2.0.3 as the IDE.<br />
<br />
If somebody knows something: please, share your knowledge and/or ideas! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">11th January 2009, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">the code worked fine when I tested (XP SP2), but I would make a couple of changes:<br />
<br />
StrCpy $1 &quot;&quot; ;make sure we start at the top of the z-order<br />
BringToFront<br />
# Check if already running<br />
# If so don't open another but bring to front<br />
System::Call &quot;kernel32::CreateMutexA(i 0, i 0, t '$(^Name)') i .r0 ?e&quot;<br />
Pop $0<br />
StrCmp $0 0 launch<br />
StrLen $0 &quot;$(^Name)&quot;<br />
IntOp $0 $0 + 1<br />
loop:<br />
 FindWindow $1 '#32770' '' 0 $1<br />
 StrCmp $1 0 +3<br />
 System::Call &quot;user32::GetWindowText(i r1, t .r2, i r0) i.&quot;<br />
 StrCmp $2 &quot;$(^Name)&quot; 0 loop<br />
 System::Call &quot;user32::ShowWindow(i r1, i 9) i.&quot;         ; If minimized then maximize<br />
 System::Call &quot;user32::SetForegroundWindow(i r1) i.&quot;     ; Bring to front<br />
 Abort<br />
launch:<br />
<br />
<br />
if there is no code before this in .oninit, you don't need to reset $1<br />
<br />
There could be several reasons why it does not work, if you set a custom caption or something like that so it can't find the window. Try adding MessageBox mb_ok &quot;$1&quot; after the StrCmp $2 &quot;$(^Name)&quot; 0 loop line and make sure its not 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eagle3386</div><div class="date">12th January 2009, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The caption remains something like â€œMy-App 1.2.3.4â€ throughout the whole time.. :)<br />
<br />
Regarding the reset, I added that line, although â€œBringToFrontâ€ is the very first command after â€œFunction .onInitâ€ â€” just to make sure.. ;)<br />
<br />
Though, the message box does indeed show â€œ0â€.. :(<br />
<br />
[-EDIT-]<br />
Okay, I probably found the reason â€” and itâ€™s almost a shame I didnâ€™t notice it earlier.. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The search focuses on what is specified via â€œName &quot;foobar&quot;â€, but Name and Caption arenâ€™t the same within my script..<br />
After fixing that issue, everything worked as expected! :)<br />
<br />
So, thank you _very_ much for pointing at the right spot! ;)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">12th January 2009, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">BringToFront does not modify $1, so you don't need to reset $1<br />
<br />
and â€œMy-App 1.2.3.4â€ is the same as the string you used in the name instruction? Try switching out StrCmp $2 &quot;$(^Name)&quot; 0 loop<br />
 with StrCmp $2 &quot;My-App 1.2.3.4&quot; 0 loop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eagle3386</div><div class="date">12th January 2009, 00:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that hint! ;)<br />
<br />
Regarding your suggestion: as I said in the â€œ[-EDIT-]â€-paragraph, it was not â€” but now it is and everything works _very_ well! :)</div></div><hr />
