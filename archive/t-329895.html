Internal compiler error #12345<br />
<br />
I did some digging and found out, that max. size of NSIS installer is about 2GB.<br />
Well, ok, it makes sense for some veeery old OS's, but now-a-days it's a big problem. Why?<br />
<br />
First - it's very convenient for the end-user to use a single file instead of keeping lots of smaller ones<br />
Second - it's much easier to distribute on the web<br />
<br />
So my question is - when will that limitation be taken off?<br />
<br />
Additionaly I'd like to ask if there is any way to hack those limits somehow. Different compression maybe? Or different compiler? Anything?<br />
(Multiple-files-installer is not an option!)</div></div><hr />

not only. It makes sense on every FAT32 Partition and afaik for normal http downloads too.<br />
<br />
Of course a single file is very comfotable but especially on those huge files you should force a crc check. And THIS takes a very long time with this filesize...<br />
<br />
If that kind of kingsize installers whould be a practicable way don´t you think some major software labels whould do this already?<br />
<br />
To increase compression ratio use LZMA /SOLID compression method. But you should think about multifile installers (one exe &amp; cab´s or 7zip´s). There are NSIS Plugins for this case.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erundil</div><div class="date">21st April 2011, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for quick reply, but it wasn't a question of &quot;should I&quot;, but &quot;how to&quot;.<br />
<br />
At the very beginning: you are wrong. 2GB limits are present in FAT16. FAT32 is limited to 4GB. But still that's not good enough, I need something like 5. NTFS drives are good with files bigger than 4GBs.<br />
<br />
If you say about &quot;big developers&quot;, I'd like to remind, that &quot;big developers&quot; usualy release on DVDs, where multifile installer is not a problem at all.<br />
<br />
One file, got it?<br />
<br />
But going back to DVD-releases, I was thinking about a multifile installer on ISO image. Gives one file. Still it needs to be mounted, not to mention that I have no idea about AutoRun.<br />
<br />
So solution is simple - make new version of NSIS, enabling 2GB+ installers, but to warn programmer, that exe this big might not be supported on some systems. Maybe introduce a trigger that have to be switched, like e.g. !define Over2GB or SetCompressor /2GB+ LZMA...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highcoder</div><div class="date">21st April 2011, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I understood your question. :)<br />
I made this suggestions because some people think (you don´t) they have to create 2 or more exe files and the user has to execute it one after another. And that looks not professional.<br />
<br />
But in the moment there is no way to create one-file-installers bigger then 2GB with NSIS.<br />
And you´re right. fat32 supports files with a size one byte less then 4GB. Provide an ISO or compressed file archive is a possible solution.<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erundil</div><div class="date">22nd April 2011, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, now working on it (on ISO, I mean). It's just there was no new version of NSIS since 6.12.2009 (more than a year, huh?), so I was just curious if we can push on NSIS Devs to extend the abilities of the compiler... But I don't see that coming, so... I'll stick to ISO. Heh.<br />
Still a dreamer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erundil</div><div class="date">9th October 2011, 00:24</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thing. Most installers we find on DVDs are unpacking files from containers like BIN files.<br />
Are there any NSIS libraries supporting it, or do I have to create my own functions to pack and unpack data?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T.Slappy</div><div class="date">10th October 2011, 05:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Those .bins use their own proprietary format. Simply use .zip .cab .7z or other common archive - NSIS has a lot of plug-ins for working with them.</div></div><hr />
