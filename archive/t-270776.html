<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">needupgrade</div><div class="date">7th May 2007, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Since automatic version checks and upgrades are now quite common (and expected), I also would like like to provide automatic upgrades for our program (the software that needs to be automatically upgraded is quite large (16MB) but pretty vanilla otherwise.)<br />
<br />
What is the best strategy for providing such upgrades? I guess uninstall and then reinstall is the easiest but our program is quite large and creates many local files for the user that should be reused in the new version.<br />
<br />
I guess the patches need to be digitally signed (authenticode?) but how can you verify that the signature is correct (openssl?)?<br />
<br />
Also, how do you avoid installers that require sequential patch installations (say we end up having 10 versions, and a user has version#1, do we need to force the user to upgrade to version#2 and then to #3, etc.) If we provide direct upgrade from version#n to version#m, that's a lot of patches to manage.<br />
<br />
Then there is the issue of checking if there is a new version.<br />
<br />
Then there is the issue of upgrading the module that does automatic program upgrades. <br />
<br />
I was 100% sure that there was a cookie cutter solution for this problem but couldnt come up with a relevant link let alone finding a solution within NSIS.<br />
<br />
Your advice/experience about this issue will be very welcome.</div></div><hr />

I wrote SwUpdata (http://swupdata.sf.net) in NSIS, which is now a dead project (due to the complexity of using ASM like code.)<br />
