But how stable is the current Alpha 7 (binary on SF)?<br />
Or is all OK as long as your script compiles? Because I could stick with 1.98 a little longer as well...<br />
<br />
NSIS 2 looks really cool btw :D<br />
<br />
--edit--<br />
Hmmm... I really don't know which one to use now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The binary at the CVS is no longer a7, it is marked b0 :D<br />
NSIS 2 actually fixes some bugs that can be found in 1.98. I am not saying it does't have some of its own, but at the moment there are no known bugs. It works, but it is recommended you check it on more than one system before you release your NSIS packed product to the public.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the binaries at SF are not the latest, so you should compile from the source code to be sure. If you don't have a compiler, let me know and I will compile one for you.<br />
<br />
NSIS 2 looks really cool btw<br />
I am glad you like it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mynab</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I also plan to use NSIS2 to release the new version of my freeware. Even if the build environment is not very stabe (I have tried several makensisw.exe and finally am still using the one released with alpha7) my installer looks OK. I have tried it on Me, NT4, 2000 and XP and it worked OK everytime!<br />
<br />
The latest versions of makensisw.exe had trouble with my license agreement page (maybe related to the text being a RTF file...): the text was not displayed at alll the the OK (I agree renamed) button was not working...<br />
<br />
So thanks for the great effort made on NSIS2. The ModernUI looks great and is definitely what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Enough said :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
most excellent work, kichik :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mynab</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded latest makensis.exe makensisw.exe, ModernUI.nsh and recompiled my stuff ok...<br />
<br />
Still my license agreement page does not work... Nothing is displayed and the I agree button does nothing. My code for the license is:<br />
<br />
LicenseText &quot;blah blah&quot;<br />
LicenseData &quot;readme.rtf&quot;<br />
LicenseBkColor FFFFFF<br />
<br />
I have got a MUI_HEADER_TEXT macro which works fine (the header is OK)...<br />
<br />
Any hints?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mynab</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">OK,<br />
<br />
my fault... I checked out all the CVS tree and ran the new stuff properly and it works fine now!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

As long as you don't use .onInitDialog you are OK, if you use it, forget about stability... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know anything about the quirks in Rename in NSIS v1.98?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 19:29</div></div><div class="posttext">0-bytes files usually come from GetTempFileName and SetOverwrite no.</div></div><hr />

But it appears I now have a fully working UpgradeDLL macro :D<br />
(I took the latest version from a thread you suggest some time ago, but that one didn't compile. Perhaps I should post this UpgradeDLL as an example?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, post it. I am sure a lot will find it useful.</div></div><hr />
