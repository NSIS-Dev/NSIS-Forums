<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lyz</div><div class="date">13th January 2006, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 4 sections listed on components page. And I want to make the last 2 indented a little, as a hint that they are part of the 2nd section and dependent on the 2nd section.<br />
<br />
I have tried resource hacker, but it only gives you handle for the box that contains the list of check boxes for the sections.<br />
<br />
And I don't want to use SectionGroup, as i found some of the behaviors of SectionGroup are not appropriate for what I am trying to implement.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

But I don't want to the user to be able to collapse the tree nodes. Could you tell me if it is possible to hide the lines and handles of the components tree?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lyz</div><div class="date">17th January 2006, 21:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Never mind. I found out how to hide the lines and handles. Once again, ResourceHacker saved my day :) By using ResourceHacker, in my case, open the modern_smalldesc.exe file. Remove the TVS_HASLINES flag. That did the trick for me.<br />
<br />
If anyone can figure out a way of indenting the checkbox, that'll be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
