<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">99999999</div><div class="date">5th June 2007, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I use NSIS for a variet of products, but the one feature we'd like to add is that the uninstaller, for a previous product is run, *before* the new installation is started.  <br />
<br />
The following <br />
<br />
CopyFiles /SILENT &quot;$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe&quot; &quot;$TEMP\uninstall.exe&quot;<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$TEMP\uninstall.exe&quot; /KEEPCACHE /S _?=$INSTDIR'<br />
<br />
So here's what happens, ExecWait runs the uninstaller, but then exits, and even after it exits, the uninstallation is still taking place, so when I run the installation phase, the product is in an incomplete installation state, as some files installed by the installer, are also being deleted by the uninstaller which is still running.<br />
<br />
I've read the docs, and looked for help here, and I am using NSIS 2.24, and they say to use the _? commandline param. That using this will ensure that the uninstaller will be completed.  But in my testing, this obviously isn't true.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at the included example makensis.nsi</div></div><hr />

As already mentioned dude, all you have to do is to take a look at the included example makensis.nsi.<br />
It is a real world installer which shows the way to go.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
the problem is that you are trying to use the NEW uninstaller for the NEW version to do the uninstall of the PREVIOUS version. <br />
<br />
So your product should write some entries in the registry<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
HKLM Software\MyCompany\MyProduct Uninstall = $INSTDIR\uninst.exe<br />
<br />
And perhaps version information e.g.<br />
<br />
The newer version should try to read the registry for the old version info/uninstall key.<br />
<br />
If it exists, use <br />
<br />
ExecWait $UninstallString <br />
<br />
<br />
to perform the uninstall of the former version BEFORE running into the Install section of the new installer.</div></div><hr />
