   I use this link for File association &quot;http://nsis.sourceforge.net/File_Association&quot;. It works fine for my extension.But facing one problem.I cannot open a selected file.The problem is I made association with my extension say &quot;.hon&quot;. Also I have many files with this extension say &quot;abc.hon,apple.hon&quot;.I want to play &quot;abc.hon&quot; when i double-click &quot;abc.hon&quot;,my player get activated but abc.hon is not played.In my player code I have written code to accept parameters but I think its something we can do with nsis. Does anyone know to solve this problem?As I am new to nsis all great ideas will help me to solve issue.<br />
<br />
<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

       I find the problem &amp; yet not solved.Actually the problem was with filename.With the &quot; registerExtension.nsh&quot; the filenames cannot be more than 8 chars.Also there should not be  &quot;.&quot; in between.<br />
  EX: abcdefhi.hon will play (as it has 8 chars).But<br />
      abcdefghij.hon will not play.<br />
      Also a.b.hon will not play (as it contains '.').<br />
<br />
   But I dont know to solve.Please somebody help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks In Advance</div></div><hr />

Add some debugging code in there to make sure you get the right argument first and then try to figure out why it's not used properly.</div></div><hr />

   My problem is solved.yes it was problem with the player.I misjudge the error.In the player code I was checking the extension &quot;.hon&quot;.So when a folder with space inbetween comes for example ['My Workplace' is shown as 'My2~\filename.hon']then its shown with &quot;~&quot; sign thus finally the checking for extension w'ont work.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
