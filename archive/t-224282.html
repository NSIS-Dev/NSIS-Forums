<br />
 CRITICIAL BUGFIX Having multiple patches in a single file lead to corrupted patches. Always. Only the last patch added to the file would work.<br />
 Fixed a bug in the stand-alone EXE runtime (not NSIS-related): process kept did not exit properly<br />
 Testing framework to test basic functionality automatically.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get it from http://www.tibed.net/vpatch.<br />
<br />
TODO list for a 3.0 final:<br />
<br />
 Address SF bug report (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1219806&amp;group_id=22049&amp;atid=373085) <br />
 Build everything using SCons, like NSIS (would that be useful?)</div></div><hr />

Build everything using SCons, like NSIS (would that be useful?)Building VPatch with SCons will not be useful for the NSIS package, unless you put it in the context of the NSIS source tree and use the functions provided in it. However, if you want to release it as a separate package as well, it is not necessary to use SCons. I recommend using SCons anyway, but you should use whatever you like best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TODO:<br />
- make an installer (or go without one?).<br />
- confirm that the GUI is working correctly with date/time stamps, MD5 checksums added. I think it does, but have to be sure in order to release a final.</div></div><hr />
