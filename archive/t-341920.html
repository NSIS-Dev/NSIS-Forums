<br />
I try to delete a file after I have read it with my NSIS installer but the file is not deleted. If the installer is still running and I try to delete the file manually I receive an error message, saying the file is still in use.<br />
<br />
My code looks like this:<br />
<br />
FileOpen $0 &quot;$EXEDIR\temp\test.cfg&quot; r<br />
FileRead $0 $1<br />
...<br />
FileClose $0<br />
Delete &quot;$EXEDIR\temp\test.cfg&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
After some queries I have figured out the following: If I add a &quot;Delete $0&quot; between FileOpen and FileClose, the installer does now delete the file:<br />
<br />
FileOpen $0 &quot;$EXEDIR\temp\test.cfg&quot; r<br />
FileRead $0 $1<br />
...<br />
Delete $0<br />
FileClose $0<br />
Delete &quot;$EXEDIR\temp\test.cfg&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anybody explain why the file is not deleted with the first version?</div></div><hr />

I added a sleep argument after closing the file and was then able to delete it: <br />
<br />
<br />
FileOpen $0 &quot;$EXEDIR\temp\test.cfg&quot; r <br />
FileRead $0 $1 <br />
... <br />
FileClose $0 <br />
Sleep 2000<br />
Delete &quot;$EXEDIR\temp\test.cfg&quot;</div></div><hr />
