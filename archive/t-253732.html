<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nebadje</div><div class="date">21st August 2006, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to use NSIS in conjunction with MSYS/make. The /D options of makensis do not work due to the GNU-shell of MSYS which gets confused by the slash.<br />
<br />
I thought about building a different version of NSIS (using hyphens for options in the command line as it has been prepared already in the nsis sources) but my scons system doesn't work properly.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround using scons in an MSYS/make environment (I tried also to escape the slash)? Has anyone encountered similar problems and solved them? has anyone a different build  ready for download?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Uli<br />

<br />
Addendum:<br />
<br />
I'm not a bash genious, but there must be a way to keep the bash from expanding the /DWHATEVER statement (to &quot;C:/Orcus/msys/1.0/DWHATEVER&quot;) and passing it unaltered to makensis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th August 2006, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">A workaround would be writing a configuration file which contains !define instructions and include that file from the script. You can also call makensis with the configuration file first and then the script itself, so you won't have to change the script.echo !define WHATEVER &gt; config.nsh<br />
makensis config.nsh script.nsi</div></div><hr />
