<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mæster</div><div class="date">30th April 2003, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Trying to implement a method to install VB runtimes leads me to the UpgradeDll-, the AddSharedDll- and the un.RemovedSharedDll macros described in the NSIS documentation. Because I'm an bloody newbie describing the NSIS macros and functions alone couldnt help me that much.<br />
I'm sure, that the best way to understand both, the use of those functions and the general handling of a nsis-script would be a sample.<br />
<br />
I'am using NSIS 2.0b3 with the Modern GUI, so is there any sample script aviable which could teach me right from scratch how to implement the UpgradeDll-Macros in a NSIS-script?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mæster</div><div class="date">1st May 2003, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">First I want to thank Joost for his fast replay. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I described my needs very bad above. <br />
What I'm rather looking for is a whole! working sample script involving the UpdateDll Macros not only a part of a script. Something that starts with <br />
!include &quot;MUI.nsh&quot;  and ends with something like<br />
!insertmacro 'MUI_UNFINISHHEADER' having the all the functionality of the Upgrade-Macros implemented between would be very nice.<br />
<br />
All the examples for the Modern UI in the NSIS documentation written by Joost Verburg (i.E. 'Basic.nsi' or 'Language.nsi') are great examples of &quot;whole&quot; working scripts with the described functionality in it.<br />
<br />
Has somebody such a sample concerning the UpgradeDll-functions for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">1st May 2003, 13:06</div></div><div class="posttext">To use the UpgradeDLL macro:<br />
<br />
1) Copy the macro to a file called &quot;UpgradeDLL.nsh&quot; (keeping it in a separate file makes your script easier to read)<br />
2) !insert &quot;UpgradeDLL.nsh&quot; ;Add to the top of your script<br />
3) Now you can use the macro using !insertmacro UpgradeDLL &quot;dllname.dll&quot; &quot;$SYSDIR\dllname.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
Btw, upgrade to the latest NSIS 2 version (unfinishheader doesn't exist anymore in the latest version :) ).</div></div><hr />
