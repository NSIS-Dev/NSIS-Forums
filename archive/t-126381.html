<br />
a few days ago I posted a question for de-compiling NSIS Uninstaller. <br />
view the old post here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=125639) <br />
The answer was that this is not possible. So far so good. <br />
<br />
The background:<br />
I called the uninstaller for &quot;myDevStudio (Release 1.2 July 2002)&quot; (mentioned to be a really good GUI for NSIS !!!) and this one killed some really important sys-files (WinXP): e.g.: NTDETECT.COM, NTDLR, boot.ini, etc.<br />
The uninstaller has shown this after clicking &quot;Show details&quot;.<br />
<br />
So in normal case (meaning if your a not  conform with Windows repair functions), your system R.I.P....<br />
<br />
I decided to mail to the developers of myDevStudio, but until now, I have got no response, so here a  <br />
W A R N I N G <br />
Don't run the uninstaller of myDevStudio<br />
<br />
Be aware that this is not a call to bann this prog, because it's really very cool, but as well the uninstaller is really UNcool. So if you decide to uninstall it, just delete it. <br />
A G A I N:<br />
Don't run the uninstaller of myDevStudio<br />
<br />
For those who want to &quot;test it&quot;, here a short tutorial how to setup your system after that:<br />
<br />
1. Boot with WinXP-CD<br />
2. Choose the repair mode<br />
3. Login as local admin<br />
4. Type &quot;FIXBOOT&quot; (always answer YES)<br />
5. Type &quot;FIXMBR&quot; (always answer YES)<br />
6. If you browse to %systemroot%, you should see the &quot;killed&quot; files again (boot.ini, NTDETECT.COM, io.sys, etc.)<br />
7. Browse your XP-CD: cd i386<br />
8. enter &quot;dir&quot; to search for NTDLR<br />
9. After you have found it type &quot;COPY NTDLR C:&quot; (verify the successfu copying...)<br />
10. Reboot<br />
<br />
Your system should be resurrected!<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
P.S: I can't verify this, but referencing to what Sunjammer said in the related post:<br />
&quot; As for a virus, well I've never heard of anything that targets NSIS installers, and to be honest I'd be suprised if NSIS is high profile enough to attract that kind of attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I can't imagine, this was my fault...</div></div><hr />
