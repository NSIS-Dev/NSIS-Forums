<br />
I need to create a program that automates the installation of two separate, but intertwined applications and also writes some data to a properties file and creates a folder structure.<br />
<br />
I remembered having read about NSIS some time ago, and I think it might be well-suited for this task. However, I'm not sure it supports everything I need, and since I'm a little under pressure, I can't risk starting to learn NSIS and later realizing that I need to start over with another language.<br />
<br />
Here's a quick overview of what my installer needs to do:[list=1] install app1 by extracting a self-extracting archive to a user-specified folder<br />
 prompt the user to enter some data<br />
possible problem: the number of fields can be dynamic, e.g. the user first chooses the number of trading partners and then has to enter some data on each of those<br />
 write this data to properties file (in the form [parameter]=[value])<br />
 create a folder structure in the installation dir (basically just create a sub-folder for each trading partner)<br />
 start the installation of the second app - i.e. run SETUP2.EXE<br />
this is an independent installation routine, so I guess the user will have to install it manually<br />
 when the installation of app2 is complete:<br />
tell app2 where app1 is installed (not sure yet how app2 handles this - hopefully I'll just have to edit some settings file)[/list=1]<br />
<br />
Is NSIS well-suited for these tasks or should I rather use another language (e.g. Visual Basic or AutoHotkey)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

If you look at the NSIS documentation there are commands suited for many taks or solving many problems, along with many functions written found on the Wiki for even more tasks.<br />

However, I found it kinda hard to get into NSIS, so I guess I'll have to use AutoHotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com) this time. That looks a lot less professional, but I guess I'll be much quicker that way.<br />
<br />
I'll be sure to remember NSIS for the next project though!</div></div><hr />
