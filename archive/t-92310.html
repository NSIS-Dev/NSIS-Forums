<br />
I need to update a system DLL that is always locked.  I heard there was a way to do this on win2k without rebooting, but even replace with a reboot would be great at this point.<br />
<br />
At the core of each example I see on this, the 'file' command is used to copy the DLL.  But 'file' does not seem to replace locked files.<br />
<br />
How can I mark a DLL to be replaced on reboot? Similar to http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q184408<br />
<br />
PS. GetDLLVersion doesn't work on my custom made DLL.  Does anyone know, by chance how the DLL should communicate it's version to this function?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

See attached file for instructions on the DllGetVersion interface that a dll can implement if you so desire.<br />
<br />
[edit: note this is not the only way of exporting version information, you can also include version information in an embedded resource in your dll... the DllGetVersion mechanism is the Microsoft standard way of supplying a version number for their system dlls though]</div></div><hr />
