<br />
The original NSIS installation provides the example script makensis.nsi which contains the following line...<br />
<br />
!define MUI_WELCOMEPAGE_TEXT &quot;This wizard will guide you through the installation of NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) ${VERSION}, the next generation of the Windows installer and uninstaller system that doesn't suck and isn't huge.$\r$\n$\r$\nNSIS 2 includes a new Modern User Interface, LZMA compression, support for multiple languages and an easy plug-in system.$\r$\n$\r$\n$_CLICK&quot;<br />
<br />
Adding this same line to my own installer only displays a portion of the whole text...<br />

<br />
...so basically the problem is line change &quot;$\r$\n$\r$\n&quot; and as soon as I remove it the whole text is shown - of course without the line change.<br />
<br />
Any ideas whats wrong here?<br />
<br />
BTW: Just updated to NSIS 2.39, I didn't try this with the old 2.38...</div></div><hr />
