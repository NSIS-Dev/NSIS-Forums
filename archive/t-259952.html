<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alstom</div><div class="date">20th November 2006, 06:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I had managed to solve the execWait problem and execute the few programs one at a time silently in the background but there is another problem. The installer called another installation to install into the computer and it is running the installation but nothing is installed into the computer.What could be the problem?? Any one can help??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem lies with the other installer. All ExecWait does it open that installer. Make sure you pass it the correct arguments and that it's running from the correct directory. Use SetOutPath to set the working directory.</div></div><hr />
