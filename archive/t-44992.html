<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">20th March 2001, 04:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, so I admit: I'm an amateur programmer.  Right now I'm using Visual Basic 6.  I'm wondering if anyone has used VB and FindWindow to detect whether their application is running or not.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm missing something here.  Could someone explain how FindWindow works and what exactly a WindowClass is? I feel really stupid asking these questions but I gotta learn somehow :-D.<br />
<br />
Thanks all,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spaetz</div><div class="date">20th March 2001, 08:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't VB use the CreateWindowEx function of the WIN32 API? Three you have to specify one parameter: the ClassName. It is like the template of a Window.<br />
<br />
You can e.g. you the free util atm (Another Task Manager) http://atm.idic.caos.it/higheng.html (it's like 80kb or so IIRC), to choose a process and get a list of its Windows and ClassNames, if you are not sure.<br />
<br />
Winamp2 will e.g. use the ClassName &quot;Winamp v1.x&quot; for it's main Window. Other programms (like ICQ) have just a cryptic name AFX:40000 (or similar) for their class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">20th March 2001, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, it appears that VB automatically assigns windowclass names to an application.  Is there anyway that FindWindow could also accept a Window Title? For example, if I wanted to find Internet Explorer with NSIS, I could just do:<br />
<br />
FindWindow prompt &quot;Microsoft Internet Explorer&quot; &quot;bleh bleh bleh&quot;<br />
<br />
If not, has anyone been able to use FindWindow with their VB application?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jay</div><div class="date">20th March 2001, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that the MFC FindWindow function in Visual C++ can do a find Window on a Window Title so I am sure that it can be put into the NSIS source code if you need it to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spanky</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">All VB programs will have the same classname.<br />
<br />
ThunderRT6Form &gt;&gt; For VB 6<br />
ThunderRT5Form &gt;&gt; For VB 5<br />
<br />
.. and so on.<br />
<br />
Unless Justin updates NSIS to have an option to read the window title you're out of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jay</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 04:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided that it would be useful to find windows based on title so I added to my own personal version, if you want it download it from http://www.shoutclub.com/nsis/<br />
<br />
Justin feel free to modify it for your version the source code is included and is just below your FindWindow Function.<br />
<br />
To use the function just put this in your script<br />
<br />
FindWindowTitle &lt;mode&gt; &lt;Window title&gt; &lt;Message Prompt&gt;<br />
<br />
Let me know how it works out, this is the first time I have modified this code and it appears to work fine on my system.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 04:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! Works great.<br />
<br />
By the way, it appears that your change also affected the FindWindow command.  I was able to use FindWindow and FindWindowTitle interchangeably.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jay</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 04:37</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm I am not able to duplicate that here, if I do a search for a window title with FindWindow, it doesn't appear to work only FindWindowTitle can find a window by title.  <br />
<br />
FindWindow will only search for windows by class, at least that the only way I can do it here.<br />
<br />
Does FindWindow work with class names still?<br />
<br />
Can you give me an example of what you are trying to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 04:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried it with my application, and other applications.  FindWindow works with both Window Title and WindowClass name.<br />
<br />
:-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 04:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, what I'm doing is this:<br />
<br />
for ICQ:<br />
<br />
(windowclass name)<br />
FindWindow prompt &quot;#32770&quot; &quot;bleh bleh bleh&quot;<br />
<br />
I get the message box with Retry, Abort, and Ignore<br />
<br />
(window title)<br />
FindWindow prompt &quot;11136292&quot; &quot;bleh&quot;<br />
<br />
same thing<br />
<br />
If I do:<br />
<br />
FindWindow prompt &quot;sdfkjsdfkljsdfl&quot; &quot;bleh&quot;<br />
<br />
no message box<br />
<br />
However, this does not work with FindWindowTitle.  It will only accept Window Titles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jay</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 04:56</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I found the bug<br />
<br />
Bad switch statement on my part<br />
<br />
it would probably be a good idea to download this new version.  I am not sure what adverse effects the other version could have on other commands.<br />
<br />
download from same location as above<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">21st March 2001, 05:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again.  I applied the previous tests to the new version and it seems to work great.<br />
