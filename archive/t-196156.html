<br />
i just reinstalled winodws with sp2 and i made a image of my computer that is spaned over 9DVDs and the 3 one is scrached so im sh*t out of luck will i get a disc docter or something to fix it so i can get the files off that dvd.<br />
the whole image is useless if a file is damaged.<br />
i have made some scipts that are like 200 lines long and i do not want to try to rewrite them</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goofee691</div><div class="date">19th October 2004, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">ok the reason for why i posted this is that i had made a few files and i just reinstalled windows actualy just activated it 3 days ago<br />
<br />
i have the scripts in a ghost image but a dvd is scrached and i can not acess the rest of the image and anything that does get restored ends up not appering after ghost errors</div></div><hr />
