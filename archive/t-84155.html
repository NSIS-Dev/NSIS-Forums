<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 06:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Until recently, we have had no moderators in the NSIS Discussion forum since it's inception (from what I understand) and we have been trying to make one of our own a moderator. But just because a new employee joins doesn't make it appropreate for him to moderate the forum. It is great the we have a moderator, but it would be much better to have a person who actually spends his time in the forum than anything. I have not seen one post from Aus in this forum and it is not fair. I can think of about 5 other people who would make a better contribution to the forum. I think that if we were to have a moderator now, then it should be one of the 5 who actually spend their time in the forum than a guy who (I think) never gives an Opinion.<br />
<br />
My 5 People are:<br />
1) liquidmotion - SlateBlue maker who knows alot about NSIS<br />
2) Smile2Me - He is one of the first people to post something<br />
3) Pomflain - He helps with understanding the port questions<br />
4) rainwater - Maker of the NSIS GUI Wrapper ... need I say more<br />
5) pjw62 - Maker of many NSIS &quot;products&quot; including a makensis DLL<br />
<br />
These people should be a moderator just because they spend so much time in the forum and they can answer just about anything about NSIS. <br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />

<br />
I would like to do it. But I don't want to forget about other people, so maybe work together with the five of us?<br />
<br />
It's up to you Duana, but the job is OK with me.<br />

And I think everyone on your list are very good candidates. But I think I would pick Smile2Me. Very quick on the responses, and helps people out considerably. I was actually quite amazed at all the work he had done for someone, in another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">SQwerl, thx for the nice words,<br />

and Duane, sorry for the typo in my previous post!<br />

I can't believe he's actually willing to do it! :) <br />
<br />
Thank you for all the advice and support you provide Hendri, it is greatly appreciated. :D</div></div><hr />

I can't believe he's actually willing to do it!<br />
Well, I can do the best I can and take a look at the Forum at least three times a day, as I'm doing now. I will help you all as much as I can since I believe knowlegde should be shared as much as possible.<br />
<br />
I hope this will be enough. But I'll wait for the formal &quot;job description&quot; when I would be choosen and see what tasks I should perform besides that (maybe something like checking the integrity of new posts).<br />
<br />
Thx for the really nice words. This makes me again even more willing to help you guys! :)<br />

Actually if I had the possibility, I would make you a Moderator. But the fact is, I can't. But it shows alot that you are willing.<br />

I'm actually surprised that Aus hasn't come to defend himself. ;) :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 08:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, we'll wait for a reaction of Aus and of the guys that should make the decision. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aus</div><div class="date">11th April 2002, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, you shouldn't be so hasty to put me down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">11th April 2002, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I had no intention of putting you down, It is just that before you joined the Winamp team, there was no one in charge of the NSIS Discussion, and that if there were to be a change, then one of &quot;our own&quot; should be included. I know that you are a developer, but NSIS has spawned a few followers who still develop stuff to make it better and that they should be more involved. You can keep your position, just as long as one of the people I mentioned also become a moderator to help out those who need help.<br />
