<br />
I'm setting up an installer that needs to install msvcrt.dll so I do the usual checks of the dll version to see if the file in the installer is newer than the one on the target system. For some reason this does not work when building the installer on a Windows NT system and then install it on a Win2k system. NT reports the version to be 6.10.8637.0 but according to Win2k it is 6.1.8637.0 (actually the version installed on Win2k is 6.1.8924.0) so off course the version checking goes nuts and claim that the file that I have in the installer is newer and wants to overwrite the existing one (luckily the Win2k dll-cache prevents this). Does anyone else have this problem? Is there a workaround?<br />

If it does, you might want to include that file, extract it to a temporary directory, and perform the DLL check on the target machine.<br />
That's all I can think of.<br />
Perhaps you should contact justin about this?</div></div><hr />
