<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">12th July 2009, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried using RequestExecutionLevel in .onInit but the compiler gave me this error:<br />
Error: command RequestExecutionLevel not valid in Function<br />
Does this mean that RequestExecutionLevel is a COMPILE-TIME directive?<br />
<br />
If so, what can I do to implement a pretty unique installer that &quot;Requests ExecutionLevel&quot; based on whether the logged in user has Administrator privileges?<br />
<br />
I would like to implement this somewhat &quot;smart&quot; installer that changes its behavior based on the account type (i.e. admin vs. limited). Is this possible without resorting to write the installer entirely in win32 C or C++?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redxii</div><div class="date">13th July 2009, 01:05</div></div><div class="posttext">It creates an embedded XML manifest for Vista and later in the .exe, specifying what privileges are required.<br />
<br />
You can look into multiuser.nsh; look in the C:\Program Files\NSIS\Docs\MultiUser folder for usage instructions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">13th July 2009, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">redxii, thanks for your answer. I know how to use RequestExecutionLevel and I have been using it successfully in quite a few installers. I just want to confirm my understanding that it is a compile-time directive and that there is no way to tell Vista something like this: <br />
&quot;for the full set of features my installer requires Admin privileges but if you happen to run in a limited account you can still run this installer - for a reduced set of features.&quot;<br />

So does that mean that RequestExecutionLevel is a COMPILE-TIME directive?<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />
