In my script, i want to delete more files (165 pcs.) on target system.<br />
Under WinNT 4.0 this is fast, but Win9x is very slow.<br />
Any idea?<br />

<br />
I come back, and i tested my program several workstation. The exactly result is:<br />
 -WinNT 4.0 :fast delete<br />
 -Win95: fast delete<br />
 -Win98: slow delete (step by step all 165 files)<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Thanks to answer.<br />
<br />
and yet sorry for bad english<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repzilon</div><div class="date">18th October 2001, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">This is because of smooth scrolling enabled by default in Win98. I changed the exehead code so it add the list items in the reverse order, just like very old versions (1.0?) of NSIS were doing and it is quite fast.<br />
<br />
A speedup on the user side is to put any window over set it as the active window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgewize</div><div class="date">19th October 2001, 07:29</div></div><div class="posttext">A much better fix for the user is to disable the stupid smooth scrolling feature to begin with.  TweakUI (downloadable from Microsoft's site, it might be on your Windows CD, poke around...) has a check box on the General tab: &quot;Smooth Scrolling&quot;.  I highly suggest unchecking it :P</div></div><hr />
