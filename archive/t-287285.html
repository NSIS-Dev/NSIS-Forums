<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">20th February 2008, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">so far i've been using this snipped of code to write files and their location into a simple text-file.<br />
GetTempFileName $R0<br />
ReadEnvStr $R1 COMSPEC<br />
nsExec::Exec '&quot;$R1&quot; /C dir &quot;$R9\*.avs&quot; /a-d /b /s /on&gt;$R0&quot;'<br />
though i know this could probably be done much more elegantly using the array plugin, i've never had a problem with the code until recently.<br />
<br />
the attached file shows the the result of the dir command when using it on a folder containing the german letter Ã¼ in the word einzelstÃ¼cke (likely happens with other characters such as Ã¡ or Ã¨ aswell). the reason why i'm creating this text-file in the first place, is to read the path to each file line-by-line later in my script. due to the problem with certain letters, i'm now looking for a more safe solution using nsis code. a workaround that replaces the affected characters would be a clumsy ways to do this.<br />
<br />
i can think of reading those file-locations using the find command, but my problem comes up when the target directory contains multiple sub-directories of different structures. <br />
<br />
at some point in the past afrow hinted me to using the arrays plugin, but the problem of directory-structures is still over my head.<br />
<br />
for any hints, i'm very thankful.</div></div><hr />
