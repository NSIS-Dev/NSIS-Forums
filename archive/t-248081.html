<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wabiloo</div><div class="date">7th June 2006, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to add product information to my installers, using VIProductVersion and VIAddVersionKey.<br />
For some reason though, whenever I use Windows Explorer Properties page for the executable created, the Version tab is completely empty.<br />
<br />
I've tried both with a /LANG=${LANG_ENGLISH} and without /LANG at all, but in neither case did I get anything in the Version tab.<br />
<br />
If I hover the mouse over the file, the yellow rectangle showing file information appears with the info in it though...<br />
So why there and not in the Version tab?<br />
<br />
BTW, the Version tab is empty, whatever computer I'm using to look at the file information...<br />
<br />
I'm using NSIS 2.17</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wabiloo</div><div class="date">8th June 2006, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't get this.<br />
If I compile the VersionApp.nsi script from the NSIS examples directory, it works, I can see version info using Explorer.<br />
<br />
My installer on the other hand doesn't show anything in the version tab, even if I put the exact same code to define the version info as in VersionApp.nsi...<br />
<br />
The difference?  Beats me. My installers are obviously a lot more complex, make use of MUI, etc. but the VIAddVersionKey are the same, and are executed every time without warning message...</div></div><hr />

There was actually a warning message, but Eclipse didn't color it correcly so I missed it...<br />
<br />
It looks like the &quot;FileVersion&quot; Version Key has to be defined for anything to appear in the Version Tab...</div></div><hr />
