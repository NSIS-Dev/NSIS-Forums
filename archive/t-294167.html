<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stonkers</div><div class="date">8th July 2008, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing this has been hit time and time again.  I apologize in advance for not being able to find the posts using a search.<br />
<br />
Here's what I'm trying to do:  run an external installer that doesn't have any sort of silent mode (i.e. can't be run at the dos prompt with arguments and such).  So somehow, I'd have to use execwait or something similar to kick off the exe and then answer it's questions (note that I know the order of the questions and the answers to them in advance) without user intervention.  Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Eric</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you weren't the one to write it, then you may be out of luck.  You might be able to use a VBScript with SendKeys commands or possibly use SendMessage comamnds (if you knew the handles to the window and controls), but I've never tried that and not sure it would work.  (But, blindly sending keystrokes is never a great idea since any changes to the window--or even a stray message box--could cause major problems.)</div></div><hr />
