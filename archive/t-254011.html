<br />
I check in my installation if the product is already installed, and if it is, I consider being a reinstall, so I don't show the choose-dir-page, b/c I use as INSTDIR the already used dir, so where the application is already installed.<br />
<br />
This is fine, but still the user could overwrite this by using as cmd line the /D=C:\Program Files\Foo. This is a problem for me b/c imagine the scenario:<br />
- first installation: product gets installed in C:\Program Files\MyApp<br />
- later the user wants to reinstall using a newer version so if he runs the setup with no param, everything fine, as C:\Program Files\MyApp will be used by default, but if the user uses the /D=C:\Program Files\Foo another instance of my app gets installed in a second directory, which I can't allow.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to prevent this? Meaning, in case I'm in a reinstall scenario (product already installed), to ignore the cmd line param /D=C:\Program Files\Foo both in silent and no-silent installations?<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
Viv</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If the product is already installed (i.e. a registry entry exists) then compare the $INSTDIR with that stored in the registry.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Where should I do that check, so that to be early enough? in .onInit would be ok?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it is not the same, then alert the user.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) And how should I behave in a silent install? I think I shouldn't warn the user in that case, but just overwrite the INSTDIR with the value read from registry.<br />
Again, is it early enough to do so in .onInit? (I'm a little confused by the fact that InstallDirRegKey is an instructions that is out of any section or function)<br />
<br />
3) So, seems that a cmd line /D=C:\Program Files\Foo overwrites the following 2 instructions:<br />
<br />
InstallDir &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\${PRODUCT_COMPANY_LS}&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
InstallDirRegKey HKLM &quot;Software\${PRODUCT_COMPANY_NAME}&quot; &quot;${PATH_TO_MAIN_APP_REG_KEY}&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I would have expected to overwrite the <br />
<br />
InstallDir &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\${PRODUCT_COMPANY_LS}&quot;<br />
<br />
only.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

I'm pretty sure I'm not the first one wanting to preserve in a silent install the INSTDIR from a previous installation, but couldn't find a &quot;recommended&quot; way to go ...<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th August 2006, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Before the script is executed, including .onInit, $INSTDIR comes from the first option available of these: From command line (/D=) InstallDirRegKey InstallDirTo keep the installation directory for future installations, you'd usually want to use the registry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">28th August 2006, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx kichik, I noticed that. My problem is:<br />
<br />
I have in the script the<br />
<br />
 InstallDir ..<br />
 InstallDirRegKey ...<br />
<br />
<br />
and b/c of the InstallDirRegKey in a reinstall case everything is ok, as the last INSTDIR is used as it is saved into the registry.<br />
<br />
But, the user might uses /D= which in a first-install case is ok, but in a reinstall case would actually install 2 instances of my application (as it won't reuse the last INSTDIR) and this is not what I want.<br />
<br />
So, is there a way to prevent this? Meaning, in case I'm in a reinstall scenario (product already installed), to ignore the cmd line param /D=C:\Program Files\Foo both in silent and no-silent installations, so that the InstallDirRegKey to be used instead? If yes, _where_ and _how_ can I do that?<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">28th August 2006, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">If it were me, I'd include a check in .onInit that would check to see whether or not the application was installed and if so, Reassign $INSTDIR to another location using a STRCPY command.  If it WASN'T already installed, then just proceed as normal.  <br />
<br />
(You could also look at using GetOptions and GetParamters to specifiy your own parameters if that's easier.  Both of these are in the help manual under Appendix E.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is what I was thinking too, but wasn't sure if this is the way to go. and also wasn't sure if it's soon (or later) enough to do this in .onInit.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes, I already use that for other stuff, but for the INSTDIR I didn't know how to prevent a user, that knows the NSIS cmd line default params, to use the /D= which for my reinstaller would have been a killer.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">28th August 2006, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">.onInit is the first thing that gets processed, so adding your code there should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">29th August 2006, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx Comperio, so in the end I did in .onInit:<br />
<br />
<br />
  ReadRegStr $isAlreadyInstalled HKLM &quot;Software\${PRODUCT_COMPANY_NAME}&quot; &quot;${PATH_TO_MAIN_APP_REG_KEY}&quot;<br />
  ${If} $isAlreadyInstalled == &quot;&quot;<br />
    MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_OK &quot;Installed&quot;<br />
