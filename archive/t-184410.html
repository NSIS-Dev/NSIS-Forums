<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarmAr</div><div class="date">24th June 2004, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have installing the great number of files (over 1000) into one folder with several subfolders.<br />
<br />
Goal<br />
During uninstalling delete only installed files. The files created in these folders after installation (for example, by user or by program) should preserv√• from deleting.<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
I use DumpLog (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=153&amp;instances=0) function to write the install log into file and read this file later in uninstall process.<br />
<br />
Output folder: C:\ProductFolder\SubFolder1<br />
Extract: file001.ext... 100%<br />
Extract: file002.ext... 100%<br />
Extract: file003.ext... 100%<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Output folder: C:\ProductFolder\SubFolder2<br />
Extract: file101.ext... 100%<br />
Extract: file202.ext... 100%<br />
Extract: file303.ext... 100%<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Imperfections<br />
1. There are no absolute paths of files. It is necessary to search for &quot;Output folder:&quot; above. <br />
2.Contents of logs depends on the language file. Changes in a language file can become the reason of failures of parsing.<br />
<br />
Question to all<br />
Whether there is other way of automatic registration of installed files? <br />
Or I search too easy life? ;) <br />
<br />
Thanks for comments!</div></div><hr />

There were some good tips in it. I think DumpLog was mentioned there too, it might help you find it.</div></div><hr />
