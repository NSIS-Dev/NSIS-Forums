<br />
I need a way to put a browser window within the internal dialog of my installer.  I'm using MUI and Graphical-installer plug-ins.  I tried using nsWeb plug-in but I don't know how to repurpose the section I want to put it in as the web browser window.  Right now when I try to create it, it will create a whole new page and stop installation.  I've included an image showing what I mean.  The red arrow shows what I want to turn into the browser.  Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you will likely have to build your own progress page though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alienufo</div><div class="date">10th January 2013, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">right, if you read my first post you'd see I was trying to use that plug-in but it doesn't seem to do what I want.  I've used ResHacker to change the sizes and layouts of my windows but the browser doesn't seem to show up.  Is there a way for me to replace one of the controls that I made in ResHacker with the browser window?  Thats what I was really hoping to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know how to use Resource Hacker. Is it the way to go?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found a solution/workaround for this problem. I used a different browser control. I used this plugin for Inno setup:<br />
<br />
http://restools.hanzify.org/article.asp?id=90<br />
<br />
This plugin allows to specify position and size of the control.  I got it working thanks to help I received at StackOverflow:<br />

Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />
