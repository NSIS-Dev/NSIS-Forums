<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">7th April 2003, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have modified the MakeNSIS GUI to include a simple GUI for defining symbols in the script. <br />
This would simulate /D command line arguments in the command line executable.<br />
I needed this because my script needed to get the product version and files location dynamically, rather than hardcoding it in the script.<br />
If this is something that would be useful to anyone else, I can post it to the forum. Maybe it can be even considered for the main build.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">8th April 2003, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Here it is. Like I said, it is quite a simple GUI. No doubt it can be refined and more features can be added to it. For the time being it does what I need, so I'm happy with it.<br />
To access the GUI, type ctrl+D after loading a script or use the Tools-&gt;Define Symbols menu item.<br />
Use the &quot;&gt;&quot; button to add a symbol and the &quot;&lt;&quot; button to edit/remove a symbol.<br />
The symbols list gets cleared everytime you load a script.<br />

You may want to recompile before running it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">viper0179</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the same thing as you did Iceman, but rather than change the MakeNSIS gui, I needed something a bit more complex. I code using Visual Basic and they have the project's major, minor, and revision values in the project file. I just made a small program to read that value and send it to the installer for me. I just need to supply which project I'm trying to compile and which NSI file to use. I've attached it. I've got the program to show the output from the makensis.exe file when its compiling the script, but it doesn't always work consistently. <br />
<br />
I also added this to my NSI file:<br />
<br />
!ifndef MUI_VERSION<br />
!define MUI_VERSION &quot;Test&quot;<br />
!endif<br />
<br />
<br />
So this way I know which compiled file is my release version. I've attached the program if anyone else wants to use it feel free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">What you have done will work once you have your script working and ready to go. In fact, I have a similar script in my release build process. The modification I have made is for when you are developing and testing your script using the MakeNSIS GUI.<br />
At that point there is no way to pass any kind of defined symbols to the script other than by hardcoding them in the script.<br />
Alternately, you can use a 3rd part GUI like HM NISEdit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th April 2003, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll have a final look at the code soon and it will probably go into CVS if I find no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th May 2003, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, added in latest CVS version. I wanted to do something about the repeated allocation of memory such as saving the number of bytes used ahead but just didn't get to it. You have also forgot to add your name to the readme. Which [nick]name should I put in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">8th May 2003, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">iceman_k should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">8th May 2003, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks very nice iceman_k :D<br />
<br />
One comment: 'Define symbols' should be enabled in the menu when you start makensisw (and no script is loaded). Can you change that?<br />
<br />
We are also looking for someone who wants to add some other new featues to MakeNSISW (to make it more user friendly :) ), such as a toolbar with icons and an easy way to change the compression method (like your define stuff). Do you want to help us with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 02:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure. Is there a formal set of requirements available?<br />
Also, I will need edit/commit access to CVS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The things we would really like to see are:<br />
<br />
* A toolbar with icons (open, recompile, test, compression method)<br />
* A way to switch compression method in the GUI (so it adds a SetCompressor command, like the defines)<br />
<br />
Other nice things are:<br />
<br />
* Automatic test for the best compression method (get the compression ratio from the compiler output)<br />
* An option to launch the NSIS Menu<br />
<br />
And of course new idea's are welcome.<br />
<br />
If you want to help us with these things, you will get access to modify the MakeNSISW files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Toolbar with icons - OK<br />
2. Switching compression methods - OK. However, if the script specifies a compression method, it will take precedence.<br />
3. NSIS Menu launching - OK<br />
4. Testing different compression types- maybe in the next iteration?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 05:20</div></div><div class="posttext">So do you want me to help out or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have sent you a PM about a week ago but you haven't replied yet.</div></div><hr />
