<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bob32</div><div class="date">11th February 2005, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having problems when trying to call a DLL with System::Call.<br />
I know for certain that the DLL is being loaded when I attempt to call it (I verified that by using FileMon by SysInternals).<br />
It is the call itself that is failing. I am going crazy trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. The only thing I know for certain is that the DLL *is* in an accessible location and that it is being loaded when I issue the System:Call. Any help would be very appreciated.<br />
<br />
Here is the prototype for the DLL Function:<br />
typedef BOOL (__stdcall *TCC_FN)(DWORD*);<br />
BOOL __stdcall MyFunc(DWORD *results);<br />
<br />
here is the function I wrote:<br />
;--------------------------------------------------<br />
SetPluginUnload  alwaysoff<br />
Function CallMyFunc<br />
    SetOutPath $PLUGINSDIR<br />
    System::Call &quot;MyDLL::MyFunc(*i .r1)i.r2&quot;<br />
    MessageBox MB_OK 'Results: $1'<br />
    MessageBox MB_OK 'Return Value: $2'<br />
<br />
; last plugin call must not have /NOUNLOAD so NSIS will be able to delete<br />
; the temporary DLL<br />
    SetPluginUnload manual<br />
; do nothing (but let the installer unload the System dll)<br />
    System::Free 0<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
;--------------------------------------------------<br />
The messageboxes that result read as follows:<br />
Results: 0<br />
Return Value: error<br />
<br />
Valid return values for &quot;Results&quot; ($1) are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32<br />
Valid result values for &quot;Return Value&quot; ($2) are 1 and 0</div></div><hr />

Open your DLL with Dependency Walker (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) and make sure the function is really named MyFunc. I guess it's actually named _MyFunc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bob32</div><div class="date">11th February 2005, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't claim to be 100% sure it's loading. I just know that when the call to System::Call is issued, FileMon shows that my setup is doing /something/ with MyDLL.dll. I interepreted that as loading, but I guess it could be /trying/ to load the dll and failing. Is there any way to know if that's the case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th February 2005, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use another SysInternal tool called DebugView. In your plug-in's DllMain use OutputDebugString and use DebugView to see if DllMain is really called.<br />
<br />
Have you tried Dependency Walker?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bob32</div><div class="date">12th February 2005, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I figured it out.<br />
Posting my solution here in case another bone headed novice does the same thing I was doing.<br />
Due to my unfamiliarity with the NSIS installer, I was just piecing code together from the samples without a 100% understanding of what it's actually doing. Anyway, I was doing the following<br />
;---------------------------<br />
...<br />
    ReserveFile &quot;MyDLL.DLL&quot;<br />
...<br />
    !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_EXTRACT &quot;MyDLL.DLL&quot;<br />
...<br />
;---------------------------<br />
<br />
For some reason, extracting my DLL in that manner was causing my DLL to become corrupted (or, for some reason, simply unusable - I haven't had time to fully investigate). Once I changed the code to be a simple<br />
File MyDLL.DLL<br />
The function worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help, by the way, kichik.</div></div><hr />

That's why it corrupts DLLs.</div></div><hr />
