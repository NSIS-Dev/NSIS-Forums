<br />
I can write and delete keys and values but am a bit stuck on the best process of backing up and restoring keys when necessary.<br />
<br />
Basically I would like to backup a key on install and upon uninstall, restore the key. Of course their is one catch. Do not backup the key if the key already exist as a backup.<br />
<br />
I would like to clone a key and all of it's subkeys into another brand new key &quot;backup&quot;. Then upon uninstall, restore the backup over the regular key and subkeys.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me figure this out?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time!</div></div><hr />

If not, you can use EnumRegKey and EnumRegValue to do the same. Usage examples of both can be found, as always, in the Archive.</div></div><hr />
