Executable files are now compressed even better, thanks to a new encoding/decoding pass that optimizes x86 JMP &amp; CALL instructions.<br />
<br />
Is there a relation between this method and the BCJ/BCJ2 methods?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to implement it in NSIS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">26th February 2004, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is BCJ. This feature has been requested before and is already on the request list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mlaan</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, it's not BCJ but a similar custom algorithm. Interesting to realize though that until NSIS has something like this, some Inno Setup installers might actually be *smaller* than NSIS installers ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">All these algorithms work quite similar, it gives you a little better results on compressed x86-32 executables. BCJ2 is even better, but that requires mutliple threads.<br />
<br />
Depening on your data, it usually saves some kilobytes, but before you compensate a &gt; 200 KB overhead difference your installer is probably quite large so the overhead is not really important anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's still a nice feature, so hopefully someone will find time to integrate it soon :)</div></div><hr />
