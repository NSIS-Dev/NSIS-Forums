<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dodgly</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 06:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It'd be nice to throw a splash graphic up just before/as the install starts.<br />
<br />
Something like:<br />
<br />
    Splash imagefile [delay]<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
    Splash &quot;whatever.bmp&quot; 3<br />
<br />
Would hold up whatever.bmp for 3 seconds.  Or we could get really anal-retentive and go miliseconds or something so you could have it up 3253 miliseconds if it that was important to you.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petersa</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I honestly think that the only reason splash screens were invented, was to have something going on during the required delay, i.e. InstallShield.<br />
<br />
So that'd be the reason why it hasn't been added yet, I guess.<br />
<br />
But having it as a feature would make NSIS all the more powerful...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dodgly</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">However, it can be a nice thing none-the-less.  Which would, as you say, make NSIS all the more manly.<br />

why to add a pointless delay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carlito_au</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason that i use nsis is because it doesnt have all the useless time wasting features like a splash screen.<br />
<br />
Its good the way it is... fast and informative... not slow and useless but the splash screen looks great<br />
<br />
oh well im probably exaggerating a bit .... infact it might be useful, and shouldnt take up much extra coding &amp; time<br />
<br />
hmm i change my mind quickily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dodgly</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">What I'm talking about is optional.  If you don't like the splash screen idea you can a: not use it or b: not use it...I might have a third option but it escapes me right now. :)<br />
<br />
But...there are some that might like to throw a splash up to advert the program you are about to install.  Just an informative &quot;look and feel&quot; type thing that other installers support (granted...out of neccessity) but this seems like while it's not *neccessary* it might still be a nice human interface thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">27th April 2001, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want a splash screen, create a program that throws one up, called mysplash.exe, then do this:<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
SetOutPath $TEMP<br />
File mysplash.exe<br />
ExecWait mysplash.exe<br />
Delete $TEMP\mysplash.exe<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
This has the advantage of compressing all of the splash data+code.<br />

<br />
...but it's a lot of extra bloat for those of us with something like Delphi...<br />
<br />
...anyone know of a small program that turns a picture into an EXE, and allows a time delay, or something? I've seen one before, but I can't remember what it was called...something like Alchemy Mindworks?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I'm not sure if you can create splash screens with it.</div></div><hr />
