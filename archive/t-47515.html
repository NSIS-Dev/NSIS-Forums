<br />
can this be done?  I asked this before and no one answered.<br />
<br />
i would like to search for say C:\winamp\test\test and change it to %TargetDir%\test\test where %TargetDir% is the target dir (duh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rm'</div><div class="date">19th April 2001, 02:57</div></div><div class="posttext">CopyFiles C:\Winamp\test\test\*.* %TargetDir%\test\test <br />
Delete C:\Winamp\test\test\*.*<br />
RMDir C:\Winamp\test\test<br />
<br />
Messy, but it should work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgewize</div><div class="date">19th April 2001, 04:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what he means is inside a data file, he has a string that says &quot;C:\Program Files\MyApp&quot;.  But if the application is installed in another location, like &quot;D:\MyApp&quot;, the prebuilt data file will be wrong.  He is wondering if there is a command to to search-and-replace inside a file that you have extracted.<br />
<br />
The short answer is no, it can't be done.  But a better answer is that yes, you can do it *but* you will have to write a program that does this yourself.  I have a search-and-repace program of my own which I use, its about 15kb and runs silently, but it is so heavily dependant on my datafile structure that it would be useless to anyone else.  I have a feeling that most people will find it easier to create customized programs like this than to try to find a generic solution.</div></div><hr />
