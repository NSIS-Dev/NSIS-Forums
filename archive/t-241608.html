<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">23rd March 2006, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm at a loss. Compiling my script and running with the command line parameters '/wmh=blah /wmm=foo' causes an invalid opcode error because the Push instruction on line 65 does not get honored. If you add a nop instruction immediately before line 65, the push gets honored, and there is no crash. What's weirder is that if I remove some of my comments, the Push gets honored also.<br />
<br />
Also, the &quot;mb1&quot; MessageBox on line 51 does not get displayed but the second MessageBox on line 53 does. There is nothing conditional between lines 51 and 53.<br />
<br />
If anybody can tell me what I'm doing wrong, I would really appreciate it. The ParseForSpace function is something I wrote, but I don't know that it can be blamed since the MB strangeness happens before it is called for the first time.<br />
<br />
I'm using NSIS 2.14<br />
XPSP2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd March 2006, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of your comments end with a backslash, including the one before the Push on line 65. This makes the preprocessor treat the next line as the continuation of the comment. That's why line 65 is ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">23rd March 2006, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">ah, thank you :) I'd thought that everything after the pound symbol would be ignored by the compiler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">24th March 2006, 01:19</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading about preprocessors (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor), I now understand how dumb I am. Of course the compiler ignores comments, but the preprocesser, which runs before the compiler, does not and honored the &quot;\&quot; at the end of my comment line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seeing how bad I am at coding, that's a good thing ;)</div></div><hr />
