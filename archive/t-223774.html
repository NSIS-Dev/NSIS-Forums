I notice that there is a linux port. As OS X is now built on BSD does this mean the linux ports work on mac? (or has anyone done a full port to OSX). <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You still can't create installers for Linux with NSIS.<br />
<br />
You can always try downloading the source and SCons and see if it'll build for you. I would think it's possible, though you may need to provide EXE stubs from a precompiled source.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th August 2005, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">It's already mentioned in appendix G of the documentation. But the FAQ is on the Wiki now, so anyone can add questions. Just put your new page in the appropriate category. For example:[[Category:Development FAQ]]</div></div><hr />
