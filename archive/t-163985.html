<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TristanOfADown</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 06:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I'm making an installer that will install a program (Obviously :P), but I also need it to configure several files that it installed, based on user input.  I don't have the exact info on the files that will need to be configured, as I have not recieved the program to make the installer out of yet, but I know that there will be 2 or more .ini's and one, maybe two .d2j files.  I need to use textboxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes for the user input.  A HUGE plus would be if it could be run again after the program's installed, just to update the settings in those files.  I have the rest of the installer done, but if someone could point me in the right direction for the user input aspect, I would be eternally grateful. :P<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Use InstallOptions to get user input.  <br />
<br />
Can that have a user input a string, then use if/then statements on it?  And - Which command would I use to edit non-ini files through the installer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can create your own custom dialog using InstallOptions.<br />
<br />
NSIS has commands like FileOpen/FileRead etc. that you can use to modify files.</div></div><hr />

Can someone offer more help on getting info from a user and editing files based on thier input?  I need to get this working by monday.</div></div><hr />
