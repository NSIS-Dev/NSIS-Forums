<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nilpo</div><div class="date">16th June 2003, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a newbie and maybe I'm diving in a little too deep for my first time.  Okay.  Way too deep!<br />
<br />
I've posted on this forum before for this but I'm still stuck.<br />
<br />
I am building and install program. Duh!  My install will be running from a CD.  I need it to copy two files to the System Directory.  One is a bmp image and one is a simple text file.  (The install has more features but it is simply adding more files and registry entries.  I figured that part out.)  The problem is that I need to edit one specific line in the text file with specific information provided by the user at the time of the install.  (It is a configuration file and I need to edit the line containing the model number information for the specific machine that the user needs to enter into a text box during installation.)  How can I accomplish this.  I'm not worried about using ModernUI unless it's easier.  I can always tweak it later once I have a working script.<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help you can give.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
It should be known that this will be used for business purposes, so if you provide code snippets etc. and would like to recognition, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

use:<br />

<br />
For the information provided by the user at the time of the install,<br />
check the Install Options readme about to add objects in custom pages<br />
and how to read those entries.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the help.  Two final questions.  Does NSIS support installation from .cab files?  And is anyone currently working on support for downloading via full-time connections (cable, DSL, T1, etc.)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">There is currently the NSISdl plugin to download files and ZipDLL to unzip from zip files.<br />
I used the command-line version of 7za to create zip files, so I assume that it will already have support for cab extraction and compression.<br />
