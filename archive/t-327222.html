<br />
Actually was unable to find on the forum exact answer on the question:<br />
<br />
is it possible to create an image which works like a link after clicking on it using InstallOptions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">12th February 2011, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not used InstallOptions in ages, but I would guess that you could add the NOTIFY flag to the image and call ExecShell in the pages leave callback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oldfriend</div><div class="date">12th February 2011, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, Anders, for your answer. But maybe you know also how to receive notification in the leave callback function?<br />
<br />
Also as I understand it is possible to create the same custom page using nsDialogs, but there is much work to place all the components I need on their places. Also seems some functions are not realized at all there (like bold text of labels). So easier to to all using exactly InstallOptions I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oldfriend</div><div class="date">13th February 2011, 00:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, seems I did almost all I wanted using code from this thread:<br />

<br />
good point that it is possible to combine nsDialogs and MUI2 :) <br />
<br />
But still have a problem which I think needs separate thread. Clickable image was made, but cursor is not changed when it is over the control.</div></div><hr />
