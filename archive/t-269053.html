<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tapamayghosh@gm</div><div class="date">6th April 2007, 07:05</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;pre&gt;1) I have written a .nsi file. an implemented â€œPassDialogâ€ plug in for serial key verification implementation.<br />
2) Iâ€™ve kept some static string into the .nsi file and comparing that with serial key input provided by the user.<br />
3) Iâ€™m not sure how much secured it is. so I want to implement this serial key verification with the help of MD5.<br />
4) Now in that case also, Iâ€™ve provided an initial string into the .nsi file. Then that will go through MD5 and will generate some hashed value.<br />
5)Now I will take some input from the user and that value will also go through MD5 and will produce a hashed value.<br />
6) Then those two hashed values are going to be compared for serial key verification.<br />
<br />
 This is my current thought of implementing serial key verification by NSIS.<br />
Now my query is,<br />
    Is the way is secured enough? because even if I pass the initial string value through the MD5, in that case also,Iâ€™ll have to keep that initial string somewhere(may be in .nsi file or any other external file).What exactly I was doing at the time of not using MD5 concept.So will I be benefited from any angle. Please suggest me any better way to implement serial key verification by using NSIS.&lt;/pre&gt;</div></div><hr />
