<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dizou</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have code like this:<br />
<br />
RequestExecutionLevel admin<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Install&quot;<br />
<br />
    #blah blah blah<br />
<br />
    ExecWait &quot;regedit.exe $INSTDIR\Install.reg&quot;<br />
<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
I know this runs because I get a pop-up asking me if I would like to modify the registry. I click &quot;Yes&quot; when that appears and I get a confirmation saying that the registry has been successfully modified. However, when I actually open the registry to look, I do not see any changes.<br />
<br />
When I do this process manually everything works. I double click on &quot;Install.reg&quot; and I get the same pop-up asking me if I would like to modify the registry. I click &quot;Yes&quot; and I get a confirmation saying that the registry has been modified. Then I open the registry and all the changes in the .reg file have been applied. Why is this not working in the NSIS file?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">15th October 2011, 01:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, try something like:<br />
<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$SYSDIR\regedit.exe&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\Install.reg&quot;'</div></div><hr />

I still get the same thing. I get the popup that asks me if I really want to modify the registry. I click &quot;Yes&quot;, then I get the pop up that says the registry has been modified. Then when I look at the registry, none of the changes have been applied.<br />

I am trying to delete a bunch of registry keys with this NSIS script.<br />
<br />
I originally started with NSIS delete registry instructions and some of the keys were deleted and some of them were not. I also tried using VBS scripts to write to the registry and some of them were working and some of them were not.<br />
<br />
I also tried using RunOnce to call a batch script that executes the .reg file. That will also only make some of my registry changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">17th October 2011, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the keys you are trying to modify/delete in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ???<br />
<br />
If so, you will have to make sure that your installer gets elevated (on Vista+) by using RequestExecutionLevel admin and you have to check for Admin rights with the help of UserInfo in your .onInit function!<br />
<br />
Also when using NSIS' regsitry functions, you can test the error flag to detect when an operation failed...<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover:<br />
<br />
On Vista+ all access to 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\...' will be re-directed 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW64Node\...' for 32-Bit applications. You have to take this into account when checking the result of your registry operations!</div></div><hr />
