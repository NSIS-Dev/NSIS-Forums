<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaj73</div><div class="date">22nd October 2007, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm currently using the macro ${GetDrives} to find removables drives (type FDD), strictly speaking compact flash drives.<br />
<br />
This works fine as long as the compact flash disk is already formated. If it doesn't contain a valid file system ${GetDrives} will not find/display the drive.<br />
<br />
I call HPUSBF.EXE later in the installer to format the compact flash card and to make it bootable.<br />
<br />
Needless to say that Windows Explorer displays the drive letter and presents the dialog &quot;Disk in drive has not been formatted. Format now?&quot; when selecting the drive.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to find these types of drives with the ${GetDrives} macro?<br />
Or do I have to call a .dll directly? (This will probably exceed my current NSIS knowledge)<br />
<br />
Somebody please point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
kaj73</div></div><hr />

A slight change to GetDrives to add the ability to get unmounted drives as well might solve this. But you might also get drives which are actually unmounted. I guess you'll have to go one level lower when it comes to drives being formatted or not.<br />
<br />
If you can write this using Win32 API, you can write a NSIS plug-in based on Examples\Plugin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
${GetDrives} does what it's supposed to do and returns all requested drives.<br />
But I totally forgot that I'm also using ${DriveSpace} to check the free space, and I only save drives with a total size greater than 100MB.<br />
Naturally not formatted drives don't return any valid size information.<br />
<br />
After removing the size check everything works as expected.</div></div><hr />
