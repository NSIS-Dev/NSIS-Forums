<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mark Jones</div><div class="date">18th July 2011, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been compiling install programs for many years now using NSIS.  I recently upgraded to windows 7 and the old version (very old) NSIS I was using wouldn't compile.  I just about cringed thinking of it no longer being there for me.   I then found NSIS was still going strong and all kinds of folks working on it.  Just wanted to say thanks for a great resource that works so good I never had a problem with it until today and it was fixed with a quick download.  <br />
<br />
I compile free programs for Royal Rangers (church boyscouts) and NSIS<br />
 is a blessing to me.  <br />
<br />
Just wanted to say thanks to all you guys for your help over these many years.<br />
