<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">8th July 2005, 06:14</div></div><div class="posttext">This is very old code which I recently found on my harddrive. I made it a while back.<br />
<br />
It's basically a plug-in for NSIS which will apply a winamp based skin on your installer (hence wansis).<br />
<br />
You can download the installer (which will set up shortcuts and copy files to your NSIS directory) or a 7-zip archive.<br />
<br />
Installer: wansis_setup.exe (http://saivert.inthegray.com/download.php?get=Li91cGxvYWRzL25zaXMvd2Fuc2lzX3NldHVwLmV4ZQ==) (201 KB)<br />
<br />
7-zip archive: wansis.7z (http://saivert.inthegray.com/download.php?get=Li91cGxvYWRzL25zaXMvd2Fuc2lzLjd6)<br />
<br />
You might also be interested in this unzip plug-in I made. I know there already is one, but I had to make my own. My unzip plug-in (named nsisunz) will output extract progress to installer log window.<br />

Seems like your installer doesn't use unskinit and so the plug-in is not deleted from after the installer quits.</div></div><hr />

Scroll bars can be skinned, but only under Windows 2000/XP. I think I will have to use code from the AlbumList (by Safai Ma) plug-in for Winamp to do that one.<br />
<br />
I'm happy that you guys like it. But since the source code is included, you can work on it too. Isn't that what code sharing is about??</div></div><hr />

So you think NSIS is hard, huh? <br />
Well... my friend (at least I hope so).<br />
<br />
I think NSIS is pretty easy to learn, except that in some situations you want extra power and then NSIS can be a bit hard to deal with. You must certainly use your imagination when working with NSIS scripts.<br />
<br />
I assume many of the visitors on the NSIS forums also know their fair share of C, C++, Delphi and other high-level programming languages. This is a forum for discussing the development of plug-ins as well. Not just a joint for you freebie script hungry guys.<br />
<br />
Give some back!</div></div><hr />

except, where is the wansis.nsh ?<br />
the prospect of creating your own skins is very exciting<br />
<br />
also, is it possible with a little C jiggering to make custom shapes instead of the standard box ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">11th July 2005, 05:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a complete new directory structure layout for the new release of my archive.<br />
Now you can extract it right in your NSIS folder and it should go along with the new NSIS v2.7 directory layout.<br />
You will find the examples in examples\wansis, the skins in contrib\wansis\skins, the extractskin utility program in contrib\wansis, the documentation in docs\wansis, the plug-in itself in plugins as usual and the alleged missing include file in includes this time.<br />
I really hope this helps. You can compile the examples without having extracted the archive in NSIS directory since the exmaples use !addplugindir and !addincludedir appropriately.<br />
If any of the moderators here can remove the link to the installer in the post that starts this topic I will be glad. The installer is broken and I suggest people to download the 7z file instead. I can post a link to a zip file if people don't manage to install 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org). It's not that hard.<br />
<br />
Here is the 7z archive with wansis and wansis.nsh included:<br />
wansis.7z (http://saivert.inthegray.com/download.php?get=Li91cGxvYWRzL25zaXMvd2Fuc2lzLjd6) ( 168.89 Kb )<br />
<br />
and if you guys are afraid of triggering my download hits counter then use this direct link:<br />

I downloaded the same zip file from the link you listed above and I don't get any warning.  I even manually scanned the files before and after extracting.  Still nothing.  <br />
<br />
The warning you got might be a false positive in the virus scanner you are using.  (I'm using AVG with the lastest signatures as of 7/11/2005)</div></div><hr />

I have Norman Internet control (a firewall and av software package) and did not get any warnings. I archived it on a 100% virus free computer as well.<br />
<br />
Nice skins. Hope you make some good use of it. Maybe in a real-world installer soon. Did the new directory layout make more sense?<br />

Is that a constraint of winamp skins or can you make XP/OS X like skins that are more in the 'eye candy' territory...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">16th July 2005, 01:02</div></div><div class="posttext">In wansis I'm only mimicing the skinning engine used in Winamp classic skins (2.x style). I'm not planning on making freeform skin plug-in for NSIS as that would require me to replace the NSIS UI entirely. Now wansis is only owner-drawing the controls and customizing the colors.<br />
<br />
The source code for the latest version of wansis is located here:<br />
<br />
wansis-source.7z (http://home.no.net/nxs/nsis/wansis/wansis-source.7z) 75KB<br />
This 7-zip archive contains a Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 project and solution file.<br />
And remember: The code isn't pretty. It just works.<br />
<br />
I hope you can learn how wansis really works from this. Inspect my code thoroughly.<br />
<br />
@grahama: And I think the flat fixed skinning of Winamp 2.x is pretty eye-candy. It's just the imagination which sets the boundaries.<br />
<br />
@SuperPat: If you read up on the BS_OWNERDRAW style of the BUTTON control class in the Win32 API you will lear how to draw the buttons and so on. Most controls in Win32 support customized drawing code, except scrollbars which require some more heavier coding (detours library is nice).<br />

this also comes with a resource hacked modern ui .exe file so i could make as many controls flat as possible (Anyone know a way to make the progress bar flat?) so they dont have the 3d border looking crap and the script has some code to enable the description text by default so its not the disabled 3D looking crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently I'm having trouble with the code for the unskinit function (not the macro, but the plug-in function itself). I can't get it to unskin NSIS properly. I have tried a lot, but the NSIS dialog doesn't have the correct size and some of the controls look messed up. I hav undone everything I have done in the skinit function (like unsubclassing, setting BS_PUSHBUTTON for buttons previously BS_OWNERDRAW, fixing the colors back to the windows defaults and so on).<br />

what are you using as a compiler so i can get it? version ect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">19th July 2005, 00:03</div></div><div class="posttext">@ZmAn3: I'm using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003<br />
You can also compile using the compiler that is included in Platform SDK but you should also get the standalone compiler pack from Microsoft since the platform one only is for IA64 and not for x86 architecture (I lost you there didn't I??).<br />
Actually any C compiler for Win32 should work. Try Bloodshed Dev-C++ which is an IDE bundled with MinGW (minimalistic GNU for Windows).<br />
<br />
<br />
Some questions:<br />
1. Should I start using the term &quot;theme&quot; instead of &quot;Skin&quot;?<br />
2. Can I only expect to see themers/skinners around here and no programmers whatsoever? I really like the themes, but I need some help with the programming as well. I don't want credit for it all alone. Nothing good comes out of that.<br />
3. I'm thinking about the button that suddenly isn't skinned anymore. This is because NSIS itself resets the window style of the button in order to set it as the default button (the one that is automagically clicked when someone hits enter).<br />
I will NOT check up on this button each 25 ms either (think of the CPU use).  SO I will have to use some other method.<br />
<br />
Kudos to all that has showed interest in this.<br />

Changes in this release:<br />
Added: Included all the themes made by ZmAn3. Also fixed the example scripts and modified ZmAn3's custom UI. Renamed it to &quot;flatui.exe&quot; though, and using this custom UI in the example script for the forum and OSX themes.<br />
<br />
Bugfix: The plug-in should now unload properly so the $PLUGINSDIR folder can be deleted.<br />
<br />
Bugfix: The install button on the directory page now remains skinned even after clicking the browse button. Also fixed a similar problem on the instfiles page when clicking Show Details button.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">20th July 2005, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">@ZmAn3: Exactly what conclusion I came to as well.<br />
<br />
@Yathosho: Change the text in the caption?? Isn't this already possible? PLease don't post newbie questions about NSIS in here. Use the other forums for that. But to answer quickly you should be using the Name and Caption installer attributes. wansis will faithfully use the caption of the installer itself. Some skins has bugs in them (altough Winamp copes better with these bugs it seems) which means the caption of the installer gets screwed a bit. Try to shift the block of letters in your gen.bmp image to the left or right just one pixel.<br />
<br />
A note to skinners: Please use fuchsia = RGB(255,0,255) for the background (or matte) color of the skin bitmaps. I know most people use whatever color they want here and include copyright texts (which is fine) and so on.<br />
<br />
Expect a new release to come out within the next three days.</div></div><hr />

I have not yet been able to resolve this. I think I will try to fix incompatibility bugs with both InstallOptions and StartMenu, by modifying both of these plug-ins. I will then distribute updated InstallOptions and StartMenu plug-ins with wansis. I have fixed most of the issues with the InstallOptions plug-in though. But the StartMenu plug-in does something else it seems.</div></div><hr />

@Yathosho: Change the text in the caption?? Isn't this already possible? PLease don't post newbie questions about NSIS in here. Use the other forums for that.<br />

a simple answer would've helped more. all shown screenshots had NSIS WITH WINAMP LOOK as caption, that's why i asked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">25th July 2005, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for being late with the release. Here I will explain some:<br />
<br />
In the next release of wansis, it will also do proper skinning of checkboxes and radiobuttons. Tabcontrol skinning is also added to the todo list but will probably take some longer time. I will probably be using C++ for the next release of wansis as I can use a pointer list class to store the controls that is being skinned. The reason for why I need to have a list is becuase I am subclassing a lot of controls and keeping the old window pointer in a Window property or userdata field is too messy. This way I can clean up some code and improve the overall speed of the plug-in. Maybe it can help make the DLL smaller in filesize.<br />
<br />
The current version is still available here:<br />

<br />
Just want to share the thing I've found today. Free tool to make nsis installers look great:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/NSIS_SkinCrafter_Plugin<br />
<br />
The thing is that there is quite a number of ready to use nice skins at skincrafter gallery.<br />
<br />
I have tested it and the results were even above I could expect...<br />
<br />
Hope this info would be interesting and useful.<br />
<br />

yeah.. that really did not worked at win2k (at least when running tests at fresh Win install)<br />
<br />
I have asked a support about this case, and they have already uploaded a hotfix.<br />
<br />
Now, it seems to work nicely..<br />
<br />
Anyway, I like their Amazonite skin, I always prefered green themes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">27th July 2005, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS skincrafter isn't exactly the same was wansis. I wrote wansis a long time ago and just recently started working on it again. I guess other programmers can do much better work on it. At least all my work is open-source (it's not like I can earn a buck on it either). I follow the GPL license.<br />
<br />
I'm working on a Winamp plug-in now. In fact that is my primary interest. NSIS comes second. I don't use wansis myself in any of my installers (it really makes the installer bigger and isn't suitable for small packages like my Winamp plug-ins. Maybe for a big project or Media Player. My dream is that wansis is used in the Winamp installer (with the ripped Winamp 5 classified skin).<br />
<br />
I will try to get out a new release. I did some fixing to SuperPats skinned buttons plug-in as well and made a makefile for Microsoft Visual C++ (nmake).</div></div><hr />

ok now how can i change the color of the borders on the controls ? also is there anyway to make the progress bar control flat</div></div><hr />

Isn't this possible with some installer attributes? I can add a feature which will draw a border on all control in a specific color, but how should I implement this? Any tips?<br />
<br />
I said I never used wansis in my installers. This is now a lie. I am using wansis in my new Winamp plug-in called NxS Skinned Menus. I am using the Forum theme by ZmAn3. But this is only on the installer I posted on the Winamp forum.<br />
<br />
@ZmAn3: You can message me using MSN if you want. I'm on from 16:00 to 01:00 everyday (I'm between jobs as they say and school start from mid of August).</div></div><hr />

saivert, if you see this message,<br />
<br />
I saw that in the last version of wansis, you corrected the problem of the button &quot;Show Detail&quot; which remained unskinned during the files copy.<br />
<br />
Wishing to defer this correction on my plugin, SkinnedButton, I thus sought, in your source code, but I'm not found the code lines which corrected problem.<br />
<br />
Can you indicate to me what are the code lines that correcting the problem.<br />
