<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting feedback now about my install and one of the things I got back was that the description text on the components page shows up grayed out. I think they'll live with it but they'd be happier if it showed up better. Is there a way to make this text show up darker? I was assuming that the control was just set to disabled or something so I opened up the modern.exe in ResHacker but I'm not seeing any reason there why it's grayed either. Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scully13</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmmm. I just ran the NSIS install and only the part that says Hover your mouse... is grayed. So, I must have done something wrong. I'm looking in the example makensis script now but don't see a .onMouseOverSection so it must be done a completely different way.<br />
<br />
Function .onMouseOverSection<br />
    FindWindow $R0 &quot;#32770&quot; &quot;&quot; $HWNDPARENT<br />
    GetDlgItem $R0 $R0 1043 ; description item<br />
<br />
    StrCmp $0 -1 &quot;&quot; +2<br />
      SendMessage $R0 ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 &quot;STR:&quot;<br />
<br />
    StrCmp $0 1 &quot;&quot; +2<br />
      SendMessage $R0 ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 &quot;STR:Comp. One - 4MB&quot;<br />
<br />
    StrCmp $0 2 &quot;&quot; +2<br />
      SendMessage $R0 ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 &quot;STR:Comp. Two - 6MB&quot;<br />
<br />
FunctionEnd</div></div><hr />

I was doing it the hard way and most likely the wrong way. It's amazing it worked as well as it did. Now I wonder how I even knew to do it that way.</div></div><hr />
