<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyakite</div><div class="date">31st December 2003, 05:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay here is what I am trying to accomplish.  In the Components page I would like to have a picture displayed on mouse-over of each section/sub-section.<br />
<br />
I would like the picture to either pop-up or to have it displayed on the left of the components where it says &quot;Or, select the optional components you wish to install:&quot;, but that would require modifying the MUI of that page, and I'm not sure how I would add a control for the image or access it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">31st December 2003, 05:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you would have to modify the MUI file using a resource hacker of some description.  There are countless such programs available and some are better at certain tasks than others.<br />
<br />
As an example of how this can be accomplished check out my MUI Mod page on the archive.  It was modified to display pictures while the files are being installed.  It has a script included which shows how to get the images to display.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyakite</div><div class="date">31st December 2003, 07:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, but what I want is on section mouse-over for there to be an image displayed either in a pop-up or to the left of the components selection window.  I have no idea what the code is to detect what section the mouse is over, as I have never seen it discussed before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">31st December 2003, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The is a normal callback function for mouseover.<br />
<br />
The MUI already uses it for descriptions, so you can insert your code after interting the macro MUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN.<br />
<br />
$0 will contain the section ID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">31st December 2003, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. That's a cool API test.<br />
I'm guessing, with system plugin, since you have the ID of every component of list box (C++ terms), you will need LoadImage API and insert it in the control ID of components page.<br />
But, hey....it's possible, didn't try it...but I will :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyakite</div><div class="date">2nd January 2004, 06:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I need help please.<br />
<br />
I modified modern_smalldesc.exe.  I changed control 1022 in resource 104 to SS_BITMAP.  Ever since then however I've been stuck, lol.  I've tried a ton of different things from this forum and the help files.  I got the image switching to work on mouseover with a branding image, but I want it to work for that particular dialog ID.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me the exact code I would need after<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN<br />
to get it to work?  I just need one example, then I can add it for the extra sections.<br />
<br />
I just need example code that would change the area in that dialog, ID# 1022 on mouseover for the first section.  I don't fully understand all this HWND, STM_IMAGE, etc. coding so I'd really appreciate it if someone could give me a little hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and for an amazing installer system,<br />
<br />

Only instead of 1202 it sets 2000. You don't need to put that code in MUI_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION_BEGIN. Just adding the .onMouseOverSection function will do the same and confuse a bit less.Function .onMouseOverSection<br />
  # Vytautas' code...<br />
FunctionEnd</div></div><hr />
