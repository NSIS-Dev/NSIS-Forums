<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbeisel</div><div class="date">9th April 2011, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">my installer places a shortcut in the user's startup folder so the application is started.<br />
<br />
in once instance, the shortcut was installed with the &quot;run this program as administrator&quot; option set.  (that is the checkbox in properties/compatibility).  not only is it checked but the checkbox is greyed out.  <br />
<br />
this of course creates a problem, as the shortcut fails on startup due to this setting.<br />
<br />
does anyone know why this would be set?  again its only 1 installation out of a few dozen tested.  its a window 7 computer, 64 bit OS.</div></div><hr />
