<br />
What I want to do is install a customised Outlook email template. I know where the files need to go, but I need to customise the template during install. Basically I need to ask for name, email, etc, then insert those values into the HTML file I copy over.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for someone to do my job for me, but some pointers to the right components I should be using would be a great help. I have found the TextReplace plugin which I think I should use for the actual text substitution, but I can't work out how to create a page to ask the user the necessary questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, thanks for the pointer. Looks like I have a bit of learning curve but I have some basics working now.<br />
<br />
I think I've already worked this out, but there isn't a form designer for nsDialogs around is there?</div></div><hr />
