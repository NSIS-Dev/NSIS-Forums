<br />
I was trying to repack one of my games that requires a ton of updates so that I would not need to go through all that crud again. I installed that game, updated it and now would like to repack that game into a setup.exe, put it on a disk and use it like an install disk. it seems to work fine till it game across a rather large file (3.5 gigs) and then stopped with an error : <br />
File: failed creating mmap <br />
<br />
I think it may be that the file is to big. what is the file size limit for nsis?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you need a bigger container - have a look at the CABSetup plugin or one of the many archive handlers (plugins / command line utilities such as 7zip).  This does mean you will have at least 2 files (an installer executable and a data file) or more.</div></div><hr />
