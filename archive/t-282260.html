<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MysticEarz</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello to all, I hope every one is good, and healthy. As the Title says, it's one of those &quot;can NSIS do this&quot; questions. <br />
<br />
I am opening a business, that caters to helping small businesses increase productivity. This will be done by offering various technology solutions to them. Such as, PC repairs, website design, back up solutions etc. However, I want to make an opensourceCD that I will give to clients when I do a re-format for them. My plan is, that this CD,upon putting it in the CD ROM drive, it autoruns, and an interactive menu come up, and that menu will have menu items that are program categories(graphics,productivity,games,audio etc) And, in those categories will have the programs with a little info about them, and an install button.Much like what is done in this opensource package: htttp://www.opensourcefreecd.org/ (scroll down for screen shots)<br />
<br />
So,the question is, can NSIS do this? Does it have a templating system, where one can custom design a GUI like the one shown? I just need to know this, and pointed in the right direction and I will do the rest (designing, learning propitiatory language etc etc)Now, I can do this up in HTML/CSS in no time. But, somehow I feel more comfortable, NOT letting something like this run be Dependant on browser configuration. Ah enough of my ranting...lol. Thanks in advance for help...see you all.</div></div><hr />

See plugins sections to catch all the things that you can do...so yes, is possible to create a Autorun app.</div></div><hr />
