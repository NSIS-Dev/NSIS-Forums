<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BarryB</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 05:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think I need the HM NIS Edit script wizard now that I have a good template with more features than the editor provides. The wizard is a little difficult to understand anyway, and I'm always having to re-set word wrapping and reload the editor after crashes.<br />
<br />
There are many editors listed at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=8 and I'm hoping someone could narrow them down for me. I want something that's free for commercial use, has a compile and run button(s) for the script in the window, provides some error reporting, and allows copy and paste.<br />
<br />
Anything like that around besides HM NIS Edit?</div></div><hr />

I can't take HM NIS Edit anymore.</div></div><hr />

This happens when you compile a script some times.</div></div><hr />

It should work for the basic operations- i.e., compiling and testing.<br />
However, more advanced features like wizard &amp; IO GUI editor are still in development.</div></div><hr />

Does it have the ability to sytax highlight, compile, etc. an NSIS script?<br />
<br />
I didn't see it in the download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flizebogen</div><div class="date">4th November 2004, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Uncomment the Line &quot;import nsis&quot; from the file SciTEGlobal.properties and you are able to highlight nsis files. At the end of file nsis.properties the path to makensis.exe / makensis.chm is mentioned.<br />
Change it if neccessary. If the path is valid you can compile an nsis script with the Key F7. The help file for the specific command can be opened by pressing F1 if the cursor is at the beginning of the word or in the word.</div></div><hr />
