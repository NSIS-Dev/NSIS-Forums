<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CoBrad</div><div class="date">7th January 2008, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way to determine if there's any files pending removal on reboot?<br />
<br />
What I mean is, say that a program is removed, and leaves a file around that needs to be removed on reboot.<br />
<br />
Now, in a separate process, I want to reinstall the program (or install another program), but won't want to if there are files/directories pending removal.  Is there any way to tell this?  I'm guessing there's a registry key or file somewhere that lists the files to remove on reboot, but I wasn't sure what it was.<br />
<br />
Also, is the mechanism that NSIS uses to specify this different than other Windows installers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">7th January 2008, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest solution is to set a flag denoting that an uninstall has been performed. Any files that are still present must be pending deletion on reboot.<br />
<br />
On install if the uninstall flag has been set and some files are present you can ask the user to reboot.<br />

<br />
So what you're saying is do this:<br />
<br />
During uninstall:<br />
  - Open a file (probably %TEMP%\flagfile)<br />
  - Try to delete it (Delete %TEMP%\flagfile)<br />
    - This will fail, so it will be flagged for deletion on reboot<br />
  - Close the file<br />
<br />
During Install<br />
  - Check for %TEMP%\flagfile<br />
  - If it exists<br />
    - An uninstall was done without a reboot.  Tell the user to reboot before continuing.  On the reboot, flagfile will get removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
That sound right?  Is there any way to know if there are any files which couldn't be removed?  If everything removed successfully, I wouldn't want to create the flagfile.<br />
<br />
Also, how does NSIS tell Windows to remove these files on reboot?  A file somewhere or a registry key?  Perhaps it would be easier to loop through that and see if there are any files in the directories I care about that are pending a reboot?</div></div><hr />
