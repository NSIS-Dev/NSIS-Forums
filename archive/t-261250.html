<br />
well at the end of my installation, i need to set the<br />
Network Access: Sharing security model for local accounts (under Local Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\ ), i need to set it to  CLASSIC - local users authenticate as themselves.<br />
<br />
i'm totally new to NSIS ( luv this tool so far:) ) and i really don't have a clue how to approach this. i googled around and found that policies in security options are from $windir\inf\Sceregvl.inf. Using this file, i tracked the registry value to Network Access to the following: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ForceGuest.<br />
<br />
i noticed changing the value from the MMC will also change the value of regkey when viewed by regedit. by searchin the NSIS forum i came accross this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=244401&amp;highlight=LSA)  which kinda confused me with all the system calls.<br />
<br />
the question now is wat's the next step?</div></div><hr />

As long as the user who is running your app has admin privileges this should work:WriteRegDWORD HKLM &quot;SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa&quot; &quot;forceguest&quot; 0Note however that it is a DWORD that you want to change and not a string value ;) <br />
