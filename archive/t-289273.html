<br />
I have most problems that NSIS create Installer larger than<br />
2GB on my WinXP SP2 and NTFS System.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it worked.<br />
<br />
Then NISI stopped and tell that file are too large and<br />
this is only on Win9x systems.</div></div><hr />

That's an inherent limitation of the file system. Win9x uses FAT32 file system, which doesn't support files larger than 2GB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
but I have WinXP Pro with SP2 and all updates installed on<br />
my computer. I have NTFS.<br />
<br />
But NSIS tell me this wrong information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">29th March 2008, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">as you've been told in this (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=288775) thread already, you cannot do an installer larger than 2Gb irrespective of your OS/system as NSIS is limited to 2Gb as it's a 32-bit program (which is where the 2Gb limit comes from).<br />
<br />
you've been given suggestions to work around this issue, otherwise you'd need to work on the NSIS source code and provide a patch/means to do what you're looking for yourself i believe.<br />
