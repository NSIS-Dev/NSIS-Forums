<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayschwa</div><div class="date">21st June 2008, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">While working on an open source project in my free time, I decided I wanted to sex up the installer to make it look more at home in Vista. The only NSIS graphics I found after some searching was monki's beautiful Orange Vista MUI theme. However, I was bummed to learn that no templates were provided (unlike the original XPish Orange theme) and derivations are not encouraged.<br />
<br />
I ended up scouring my Vista system files for any art assets that might be useful. From various icons (windows update, ultimate extras, bitlocker) I pieced together a &quot;virgin&quot; copy of the blue software box that seems to be used in a few places around Vista. I also stuck on the plus and X I found in various other places, hoping they sufficiently convey &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'd basically like to ask the community if this sort of art would be useful, and if it would be worth refining and making a more comprehensive package for this style (icons that scale well, templates for all graphics that go in prefabbed MUI installers, perhaps some instructions on how to easily adapt the templates).<br />
<br />
The first picture shows the basic concept of &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot;. The second picture shows a wizard banner mock-up on the left, and an example of an adaptation on the right. The attached file is a GIMP image with layers labeled and arranged for easy playing/editing (it is compressed so the forum will accept it).<br />

Certainly I vote Yes. Just make sure you wouldn't mess with any copyrighted material. <br />
This is another concern of mine. As I mentioned, the graphics are basically lifts from various Microsoft icons. That probably violates copyright in some way. My gut feeling is that it's probably not a big deal since MS encourages 3rd party apps to be as consistent as possible with their OSes, and because &quot;everybody else is doing it&quot; (I have seen many adaptations of this box around the web). :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I will have to do some investigating to see what they permit.</div></div><hr />

Without a background it would already be a good wizard image. However, you do need to redesign a similar box from scratch instead of using Microsoft graphics. We cannot include it in the NSIS distribution if there are concerns regarding copyrights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">21st June 2008, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I highly doubt the &quot;box&quot; can cause any Copyright problems, as long as it's not an exact copy of a Microsoft image. But the &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; icon is copyrighted by id Software, that's for sure ;)</div></div><hr />
