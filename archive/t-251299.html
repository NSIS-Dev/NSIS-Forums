<br />
From early September, I'm probably going to be AFK for 3 months (at sea on this: http://www.pcrf.org/). So, I need someone to takeover maintainence of the Debian package of nsis for me. It shouldn't be too much work, just packaging and testing new versions as kichik releases them. There is only one bug, which you can ignore unless you want to port System.dll to GCC (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=227304). If you are not a Debian developer, that is fine, as my sponsor has agreed to sponsor anyone who takes over. When I return, I don't mind taking over again, or co-maintaining the package with someone.<br />
<br />
Also, Dave has expressed interest in this, so please co-ordinate with him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fatsoft</div><div class="date">26th July 2006, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi pabs,<br />
<br />
I would be interested in helping maintaining Debian NSIS package. Although I do not have much experience with Debian package maintenance, I've been using and actively administering Debian servers for 6 years now and I think I've got a lot of experience with Linux and Debian in general.<br />
<br />
If you think I could learn how to maintain the package quickly and are interested in my help, please contact me.<br />
<br />
By the way, I've come to this forum because I just started using nsis and wanted to make nsis installers under Debian - however, I keep getting Segmentation fault when runing makensis...<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
fatsoft</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">26th July 2006, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">1) What version of makeNSIS do you use<br />
2) What processor does your DEbian run on<br />
   Or is it with all your Debian PC's?<br />
3) Did you use precompiled WIn32 packages and only compiled Makensis on Debian, which compiler version?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. I intentionally didn't post more detailed info as I didn't want to be too much off-topic.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's more info:<br />
<br />

<br />
On my other system (i686), the same version of makensis runs without any problem.<br />

I am using binary package from Debian repository.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pabs</div><div class="date">26th July 2006, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">About the error: that is because you are running nsis on amd64. Currently nsis has problems running on some 64bit platforms. IIRC, the debian buildd logs show signs of this on amd64, ia64 and alpha.<br />
<br />
About the packaging, my email is down ATM, but come talk to me either in #nsis on irc.landoleet.org or in #debian-mentors on irc.debian.org (aka OFTC - NOT freenode) (nick = pabs). To maintain nsis, you'll need a windows box to test the example installers on, either a full install or a chroot of debian sid (preferrably i386). If you need to patch nsis for debian (or update the 1 existing patch, which is basically a copy of the cvs log processed with cvs2cl), you will need to install and learn quilt (it has good docs, I recommend trying gquilt before going plain command line quilt). In the meantime, please read the debian-mentors FAQ and the new maintainer guide:<br />
<br />
http://people.debian.org/~mpalmer/debian-mentors_FAQ.html<br />
http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/<br />
<br />
Also, please subscribe to and read debian-devel-announce, and perhaps consider subscribing to debian-mentors (good for asking questions) and debian-devel. Please note that Debian is in count-down-to-release mode, so be sure to fully test any new releases to catch problems with last minute changes. The latest release timeline is here:<br />
<br />
http://release.debian.org/<br />
http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/07/msg00005.html<br />
<br />
Thanks heaps for this offer and for giving back to the Debian and nsis communities in this way. Here are some links about the existing Debian nsis package:<br />
