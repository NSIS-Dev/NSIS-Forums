<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spunko</div><div class="date">12th July 2006, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">hi.. I have a custom server with some files i need to install in counter-strike folder for steam.<br />
The problem is that all steam users have their own path for steam..<br />
I mean every path changes because of the username or hard drive, like mine &quot;D:\Steam\SteamApps\sidico\counter-strike&quot;, but almost every one have it in &quot;C:\Program files\Steam\SteamApps\@user\counter-strike&quot;<br />
<br />
how can I set &quot;InstallDir&quot; to get the correct path for the folder &quot;counter-strike&quot;, no matter wich drive is it or the most important thing &quot;the username&quot;.. I have no idea :(<br />
<br />
thanx a lot..</div></div><hr />

it helped me a lot, now my installer works like I wanted, it install everywhere steam is..<br />
<br />
I tryed to make another installer for my dedicated server, the problem is that I have to install it in another path, in my PC at home is in &quot;C:\program files\valve&quot;, but in my college is in &quot;E:\custom server\valve&quot;.. I tryed to modify the code but it doesn't compile.. I'm so noob at this, can u help me with a code like yours but this time it just have to look for the folder &quot;valve&quot;<br />
<br />
I really wanted to do it myself, but I can´t..<br />
Sorry if I´m asking too much.. sorry for my english too..<br />
<br />
thank you..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">13th July 2006, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The function should still work, because it gets the path from the registry. It does not search the computer for a &quot;Valve&quot; folder. This would be very unprofessional.<br />
<br />
Is &quot;E:\custom server\valve&quot; a proper Steam installation?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spunko</div><div class="date">13th July 2006, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry I forgot to mention, valve forlder is for counter strike 1.5 that is still popular in my country<br />
I think 1.5 has to be with WON or something, It doesn´t come with steam :(<br />
<br />
Edit: I think it has to look for hl.exe because you can change the name of valve folder too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">13th July 2006, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">If it isn't a Steam program then it will likely have a registry entry somewhere else for the location that it is installed in. Use the search feature in regedit and do a search for the folder path.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spunko</div><div class="date">14th July 2006, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">thanx.. I have the path, the problem is i dunno how to use it to install there.. for exmaple:<br />
I have HKCU &quot;Software\Lala&quot; &quot;Lala&quot;<br />

<br />
For a default install path, use InstallDir &quot;my path&quot;.<br />
If that registry key exists however, it will use the path in the registry instead.<br />
