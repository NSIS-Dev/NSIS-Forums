<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wilderf</div><div class="date">14th January 2009, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a set of applications developed using wxPython. Once I &quot;compile&quot; the python files into exe's, they both share the same library folder. The library folder it 19M and has 32 files in it.<br />
<br />
My problem is that the end user has the option to install an individual exe by itself (without installing the other), or install both exe's.<br />
<br />
The only way I could think to get around this was to create a macro and have both sections call that macro. One of the things I do inside the macro is the FILE command to add files to the installer. Because this macro is called twice (once for each exe's section), the same library files are added twice and also extracted twice during the install. The 2 calls to the macro don't affect the over all size of the installer (as far as I can tell), just the time to compile it and run the installer. I feel there has to be a more elegant way.<br />
<br />
I have tried to search for a solution, but I haven't had any luck. Does anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
How can I include the FILE command once even though it is needed by 2 independent exe's in the same installer?<br />
<br />
(I am sorry if this has been answered somewhere else...if so please point me to it)<br />

<br />
You could use InstallLib (see headers supplied with the distribution), which would work, but it is more for when two separate installers install the same files.</div></div><hr />
