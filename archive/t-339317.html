<br />
I am creating a setup file to deploy sharepoint WebApplication. I will have to first create a web application on the IIS and SharePoint Farm. For this I have a Powershell script which will do all that for me. I wanted to execute this powershell script using nsis.<br />
         I tried this :<br />
        SetOutPath $INSTDIR\CGD<br />
	File Files\CGDirectSiteInstallation.ps1<br />
	Execwait &quot;$INSTDIR\CGD\CGDirectSiteInstallation.ps1&quot;<br />
but I am not able to execute this PS1 file.<br />
Also this PS1 file will accept some parameters which will be taken from user.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if I am doing anything wrong or how to execute this ps1 file?<br />
Execution of this ps1 file should be silent.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards,<br />
Mayur Mahajan</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I am getting some problem for running the ps1 file through NSIS. It is as follows :<br />
I have used some SharePoint commands like &quot;New-SPAuthenticationProvider&quot; and &quot;New-SPWebApplication&quot;. So while executng  these commands it gives me following errors :<br />
&quot;The term 'New-SPAuthenticationProvider' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.&quot;<br />
<br />
To make this execute properly I tried to execute Add-PSSnapin command which is as follows : &quot;Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell&quot;.<br />
After executing this command I am getting an error as :<br />
Add-PSSnapin : No snap-ins have been registered for Windows PowerShell version 2<br />
<br />
I tried to get solution on google, but in vein.<br />
<br />
If I ran the same ps1 file through SharePoint Powershell then I didn't get any errors and the Web Application gets created successfully.<br />
<br />
Please suggest a way to get out of this. Is there any other method through which we can create web application on IIS as well as on SharePoint Farm?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards,<br />
Mayur Mahajan.</div></div><hr />

I got my problem and meed some help in solving it.<br />
The problem was, to run SharePoint commands I should run the SharePoint script in SharePoint Management shell. So I converted the windows powershell (the window which gets opened after executing ExceShell command) to SharePoint Management shell.<br />
But for now the problem I am getting is, as the Windows Poershell gets converted to SharePoint Management Shell the window gets close. It should not get closed.<br />
<br />
 Please suggest me solution for this or else suggest another way to create Web Application on IIS, while running the setup file.<br />
<br />
My requirement is when the setup starts it should create a new web application on IIS and then SharePoint Farm.<br />
<br />
Please do let me know about this. I have been doing work on this since very long time  and the NSIS and NSIS is the last hope.</div></div><hr />

I meant to say that, when we use ExecShell command then it opens Windows Powershell. So can we directly open the SharePoint Powershell (i.e. Sharepoint Management Shell)</div></div><hr />
