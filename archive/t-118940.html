<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RIV@NVX</div><div class="date">24th December 2002, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">kichik or anyone - is it possible to have all variables used by NSIS listed cathegorically?<br />
I used NSIS readme before NSIS 2.0 (because it had tables and I could select all variables (but anyway, I like the current readme better :))<br />
example list (NSIS 1.9x hightlighter):<br />
<br />
OutFile Name Caption SubCaption BrandingText Icon<br />
<br />
and so on with one space between.<br />
Any ideas?<br />
BTW, I am making highlighter for ConTEXT (www.fixedsys.com/context) for NSIS2, so I ask.</div></div><hr />

AS for the list itself, I have some leftover stuff from 1.97... its not complete, but its a start.<br />

kichik is only non-flaming always answering to stupid questions mod!<br />
Congrats! This thing works!<br />
Highlighter will be done soon. Thank you, kichik!</div></div><hr />

Well, I have added &quot; - note the StringBegChar in highlighter, not sure if .chl highlighter format supports more... will be done.<br />
Anything else? Some variable in wrong group?</div></div><hr />

Those should be in the second group, not the first.<br />
<br />

<br />

Suggestions?<br />
kichik, you can download ConTEXT from www.fixedsys.com/context - try it, it is very good! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th January 2003, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I am perfectly fine with my EditPlus. Besides, according to the FAQ it doesn't look so complete... Can't word wrap, can't combine PHP and HTML in one file, bugs with large files, can't edit files with zeros in them, and no tabs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RIV@NVX</div><div class="date">11th January 2003, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, ConTEXT 1.0 is in works, rewritten from scratch, closed beta will happen soon. I wanted you to download ConTEXT to check the NSIS highlighter, not to use it :) Anyway, is highlighiter good now, because I am going to port it to AnyEdit (it uses NSIS;)) when I have keywords properly arranged.<br />
Is that EditPlus good? Does it support NSIS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th January 2003, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I like EditPlus, it's very customizable and is easy to use. It's not free though. I bought it before I even knew C, not to mention NSIS :D<br />
<br />
I have written a syntax file for it and sent it to the author a long time ago. The file he has on his website is very old. I have a newer addition on my computer but it changes so rapidly so I don't send it to him. I will send it when NSIS 2 final is out.<br />
<br />
If you took all of the words from NSIS the way I told you to then your syntax file is complete. I told EditPlus to treat your file as a NSIS script and all of the words were in the right place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RIV@NVX</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 08:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a process of making a highlighter for another editor (syn Text editor).<br />
<br />
This editor has three grops of words for highlighting (and I need exactly three, but I am not exactly sure how to divide them correctly):<br />
1. Objects<br />
2. Constants<br />
3. Keywords<br />
<br />
In my previous NSIS highlighter there were three groups of keywords:<br />
a) AddBrandingImage AddSize AutoCloseWindow BGGradient (etc.)<br />
b) Abort BringToFront Call CallInstDLL ClearErrors (etc.)<br />
c) SW_SHOWNORMAL SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED SW_SHOWMINIMIZED (etc.)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions of how to put them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would bring me to (let's say):<br />
1. a)<br />
2. c)<br />
3. b)<br />
<br />
I know it's not 100% accurate, but it's better than combining both keywords, right? :)</div></div><hr />

Q: i didnt found &quot;PluginDir&quot; (line 44) - this is not descriven in any helpfile. From where did you get it?<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure it was present in 2.0b1, by the time I was working on that highlighter.<br />
<br />
I think it got changed to &quot;!AddPluginDir&quot;, but I am not sure - remove it for now.<br />
<br />
How about dim? I don't understand what it really means.<br />
<br />
Seems like I will have to do Modern UI strings from scratch (and verify the other ones).<br />
<br />
Kichik, Joost and the others are working too fast for us, aren't they? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Constants] aren't complete; [Objects] and [Keywords] are. Might be useful to someone, so I am posting it here.</div></div><hr />
