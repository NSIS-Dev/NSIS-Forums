<br />
I checked the posts connected to my problem, but I still can't solve it. I have made a installation script for my application. The installation/uninstallation runs without any problems on Windows 2000 and XP. When I tried to install it on Windows Vista, everything was ok too, but I have a problem with the uninstallation. I always get message &quot;You do not have sufficient access to uninstall ... Please contact your system administrator.&quot; But this happens only when I try to uninstall the application from the Control Panel. When I start directly the uninstaller, everything works fine. I tried with &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot;, but the result is the same.<br />
By the way, UAC is switched off...<br />
Can you advice me how to solve the problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you running as Admin? (If you are not, but you stored the uninstall info in HKLM, it would make sense for Vista to stop you)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have solved my problem and I decided to write some notes what was the reason for this behavior, because it was really strange. <br />
The problem comes from my script. The UninstallString that I'm writing in the registry was wrong. There was one quotation mark symbol at the beginning (but not at the end). When I removed it, the uninstallation on Vista was executed without any problems. <br />
Here are two concussions:<br />
1. Windows Vista checks better the syntax of this UninstallString. On Windows 2000 and XP this error doesn't make any problems.<br />
2. Windows Vista shows completely wrong message in this case - there is no problem with the access rights and it is difficult to understand what is the real problem.</div></div><hr />
