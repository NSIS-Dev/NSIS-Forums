<br />
I tried to search for &quot;cancel&quot;, &quot;abort&quot;, &quot;ENABLECANCEL&quot; but didn't succeed, so I'm asking:<br />
<br />
Why doesn't the /ENABLECANCEL flag work for the page &quot;instFiles&quot; although it's the last page in my installer? The documentation states it should work this way.<br />
<br />
Is there any other way to enable the &quot;Cancel&quot; button while copying files?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Nils</div></div><hr />

I would use the nxs plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nxs_plug-in), because this has cancel functionality. If you have many files in your install, I would suggest you write a small app like the one here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/One_Installer_with_Different_Installation_Files_Each_Time). It makes a list of files as an NSIS header file, and is then included into the main installer. Add extra commands for the nxs plug-in in the script. This is just one solution, can't think of other solutions.</div></div><hr />
