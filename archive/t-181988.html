<br />
I have an aplication with an .ini file in which it stores some settings, I extract them with a lot of other files (all in to another directory), and afterwards I execute some of those.<br />
But when I launch the app, it should open the .ini file in the same directory and read the settings, and if there isnt an ini file it makes an new one in the same directory.<br />
<br />
now the problem is it thinks it is run from a different location, (e.g. one of the dirs I copied files to). it just takes one of those.<br />
<br />
How do I make the app see the correct path it is launched from so it takes my ini file with the correct settings?</div></div><hr />
