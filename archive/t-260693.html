<br />
My installer installs about 5 section and then uses GUID from registry to uninstall most sections.<br />
<br />
I am very happy with this solution, But if a component is updated to a new version, I am guessing the GUID uninstall string will fail and it will be left there, no big deal since I hope I don't have to many uninstalls.<br />
<br />
Also, with DOTNETFX30. Microsoft do not like this uninstalled from anywhere but control panel, so I have decided to leave that runtime after full uninstall.<br />
<br />
Also, that combined NSI script doesn't run after compiled and should really have an example, I am not to good with NSI scripts.<br />
<br />
Thanks for help.</div></div><hr />
