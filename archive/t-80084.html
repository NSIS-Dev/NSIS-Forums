<br />
This would seem to indicate that COPYFILES only deals with 8.3 filenames.  Did I do something wrong?  Is this left-over from the bad old days?<br />
<br />
TIA from a big NSIS fan :-)<br />

I tested the CopyFiles with some long file names. At my Win2K machine it seemed to work fine...<br />
<br />
So I think it's not the CopyFiles, but maybe there's something wrong on the destination machine...<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
NSIS implements the CopyFiles instruction with a call to Win32 Shell API function SHFileOperation. This function suffers from the following bug:<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q186152/<br />
<br />
(Note that according to Microsoft &quot;This behavior is by design&quot;, but personally I don't believe them.)<br />
<br />
A workaround would be to fix the copying mechanism to in exehead/exec.c to retrieve the full pathname of the destination before passing it to SHFileOperation. <br />
