<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnChen</div><div class="date">20th May 2011, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">If I define a macro, for example, !define MY_WALLET &quot;empty&quot;. When I use MY_WALLET this way, MessageBox MB_OK $MY_WALLET, then &quot;$MY_WALLET&quot; will be displayed. In order to display &quot;empty&quot;, I have to use it like MessageBox MB_OK ${MY_WALLET}. Why? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

But we use $1 or $R0 as variables. So I guess ${} is for user defined variable and $ is system defined variable like $1 or $R0. Am I right? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th May 2011, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">No! You really need to read the manual. !define creates a constant not a variable. Var creates a user variable. User variables and NSIS registers ($R0-$R9, $0-$9) use the same syntax ($var). Constants use ${constant}. Constants are evaluated at compile time, i.e. their place-holder (${constant}) is substituted with their value at compile time. The actual constant no longer exists in the built installer executable. This goes for every command that begins with a !, hence why they are in the manual under compile time commands. Not sure why I am answering this - you really should look this stuff up.<br />
<br />
Edit: And don't confuse run-time constants (e.g. $SYSDIR) with compile-time constants (${myconstant}). They are not the same. $SYSDIR (etc.) is like a special variable which has its value set before .onInit, but you cannot write to it.<br />
