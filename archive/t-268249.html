<br />
I've been trying to scrounge up information on building installers and uninstallers for Vista.  However, it appears a lot of the information in the Forums no longer applies or is otherwise outdated or incomplete.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, *I* can't tell which is what.. (I managed to completely lock myself out of a folder a while ago and only got back in after denying myself and everybody else access first - err.) so I'm a bit stuck on half-worries.<br />
<br />
I have tried my installer on Vista and found that, as far as I can tell, it works just fine.  There's the whole 'unknown publisher' bit, which I believe can be fixed by paying somebody body (bah), but other than that.. no hitches.<br />
<br />
My uninstaller seems to go well, too, but ends up throwing the &quot;This program might not have installed correctly&quot; dialog.  No idea what's causing that.<br />
<br />
So back to the main question - I'm sure others are wondering as well.. is there a 'guide' for building Vista installers / uninstallers?  I checked the WiKi, but no luck there.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

To get rid of the &quot;unknown publisher&quot; you do need to pay someone to get a certificate. To get rid of the uninstaller warning, you should use RequestExecutionLevel which will add a manifest that'd cause Vista to avoid its automatic backward compatibility tricks.<br />
<br />
There's also the issue of applications executed from the installer executing in the same context, the administrator context and not the user context. Andres has some solutions (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=265780) for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That last bit will require some reading, there is a launch of IE from somed shortcuts involved.<br />
<br />
P.S. The random ad-banner swooped me away from this thread to a site for drivecleaner, which was rather adamant about me installing it.  Didn't, of course.. just a heads up :)</div></div><hr />
