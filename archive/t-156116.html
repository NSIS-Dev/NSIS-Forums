What I would like to do though is add to the editor, now who is working on this, and how exactly would I do that?  Do I just download the latest source, make all my changes then email it to someone or?  Sorry if these are all dumb questions, but I have never worked on an open source project before.  If someone could just give me a bit of insight that would be great!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">you would need to have a copy of the development snapshot and all the source code is in there.<br />
<br />
you can make you alterations and (as i've done) post things here in the forum or you can pm one of the devs i think.<br />
<br />
when you say 'editor' do you mean makensisw? also what is it that you want to do?<br />
