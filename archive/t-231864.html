<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mark Poyser</div><div class="date">25th November 2005, 04:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I CreateDirectory in the Start Menu ($SMPROGRAMS) and then have several CreateShortCut to tuck in there.  But I'd like to have it so that a particular short cut is at the top when the set &quot;flys out&quot; to the right.<br />
<br />
I can't figure out how to do that.  Reordering the CreateShortCut lines doesn't seem to make a difference.  The ordering doesn't seem to be alphabetical or file-date sensitive.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how to get a particular short cut to be the top one?  (this is for convenience only, but would be nice to have)</div></div><hr />

That's for the end-user to decide. However, you can highlight one shortcut on Windows XP as a new program. See the following Wiki page for more information:<br />

I have managed to get the ordering as I like it - for now - due to total randomness.  As I've been making changes to the modules and recompiling, the right ordering came about (on XP, 2000, 98 OS).<br />
<br />
But I'll definitely try the &quot;XP option&quot; as it were.</div></div><hr />
