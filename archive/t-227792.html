<br />
Please let me know if stumble upon any problems. Like this one (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/ListBox_example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just finished migrating the entire website to MySQL 4.1.<br />
<br />
According to SourceForge, this should resolve all of the performance issues.Recently, many projects have noted performance problems with our project web service and project database service (based on MySQL 3.23.x).<br />
<br />
It is our pleasure to report that these performance problems have been resolved and we have launched a new project database service offering, available now.  This new service offering, based on MySQL 4.1.x, will replace our existing MySQL 3.23.x service.Please let me know if you spot anything wrong with the entire website.<br />
<br />
I've blocked access to the old database to avoid new data being added. As far as I can tell, I've migrated every part of the website to the new server. If you get an access denied error anyway, let me know so I can migrate that part of the website as well.</div></div><hr />
