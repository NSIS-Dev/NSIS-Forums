<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbh</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to recompile the NSIS source code (v1.96).  I first went to mingw.org and downloaded &amp; installed the compiler.  I created a Release directory under the exehead directory.  I compile fine by typing either &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make all&quot; without any errors.<br />
<br />
My first test is to run an existing .nsi file through my new makensis.exe.  It's hard to explain in words, but I'll try my best.  When I run my newly created install exe, instead of bringing up one dialog where the user chooses where to install, two dialogs come up.  One is in the middle of the screen with the title test of &quot;installer...&quot; and has the install button.  But there is another dialog in the upper left of my screen that has the default location of where to install to as well as the browse button.  This dialog does not seem to be framed either.<br />
If the description doesn't make sense, I can attach some bitmaps.<br />
<br />
I am compiling this under W2K.  Is there anything else that I need to do?<br />
<br />
Secondly, the reason I am trying to compile the source is that I would like to have a version that creates a log.  So I uncommented the definition of NSIS_CONFIG_LOG in config.h and recompiled everything.  I then created another installer.exe using this version of makensis.exe.  I was expecting to get a file &quot;install.log&quot; with a list of everything installed, but I could not find the file anywhere. Is there anything else about NSIS_CONFIG_LOG that I need to know?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Beth</div></div><hr />

You might want to search the forum archives to see if there was a solution.  It seems like it is a mingw problem.  Did you try upgrading the mingw packages?  The complete package is usually out of date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbh</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it does seem to be a problem with mingw. I made the updates suggested in resource.rc and that solved the problem.  I suppose I should also try updating the software too w/o making the changes to the software- I would prefer that as my final solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks. <br />
<br />
I will re-ask my question about the logging under another subject heading as that still does not seem to be working like I thought.</div></div><hr />

i am totally new to this, and have no idea how to use the compiler.<br />
<br />
also, do you recommend any other program to use as a compiler?<br />
what is the distribution build of nsis compiled with?</div></div><hr />

Make sure you are not trying to run the &quot;Debug&quot; build.  Only the Release build will work.</div></div><hr />
