<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lel</div><div class="date">7th July 2006, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
I'm new to NSIS and I'm trying to use it to install my appplication, for that application I need to install QuickTime.<br />
I already found useful information here to check whether QuickTime is already installed, now I'm trying to install it silently, considering the QuickTImeInstaller.ini didn't work I used ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\QuickTimeInstaller.exe&quot; /S',<br />
in this case the ExecWait doesn't wait and the installation of QuiTime is partially silent cause I can see in the TaskBar, but without any dialog.<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">7th July 2006, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be a switch similar to /S to make it wait.<br />
If you can't find it, you can use the &quot;start&quot; command with /wait (but I don't think this exists on all Windows OS').<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lel</div><div class="date">7th July 2006, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, thanks for answering.<br />
Well, I found the /sms switch as suggested in<br />
unattended.sourceforge.net/installers.php (http://unattended.sourceforge.net/installers.php) <br />
but that didn't work, event providing the generated setup.iss.<br />
Is there some other way to do so? <br />
thanks again<br />
bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lel</div><div class="date">8th July 2006, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Or a way to download from the internet the latest version and then install it, always waiting for it to finish.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">8th July 2006, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The research I've done seems to indicate that QuickTime uses MSI for it's installer.  Which means that the installer front-end (the actual installer) is likely passing control to MSIEXEC to run the exctual install.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatley, I haven't been able to locate the actual MSI file.  And this webiste (http://www.appdeploy.com/packages/detail.asp?id=520) seems to indicate that the installer EXE passes other parameters to MSIEXEC, making it impposible to run the MSI file directly anyway. edit: At least not without knowing the paramters (which I have not been able to find)<br />
<br />
Knowing this, it might be best to check for the presence of the version of QuickTime you require and then offer a polite message to the user that they need to install version x.xx of QuickTime before running your installation.<br />
<br />
And don't forget:<br />
Apple requires you to have a license to distribute their products.  Info about that can be found at http://developer.apple.com/softwarelicensing/agreements/quicktime.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lel</div><div class="date">9th July 2006, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again<br />
that would be a good choice also for preventing me from putting the large installation file(QuickTimeInstaller) into my setup.exe.<br />
And, hoping it's not too trivial question, how to direct the user without Quicktime to the download and execution of the QuickTimeInstaller?<br />
Some Exec ...<br />
or there are special functions for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">9th July 2006, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">One suggestion would be to display a custom page that tells the user they do do have qucktime and provide a link to www.apple.com/quicktime/download/win.html.  See the InstallOptions doc for instructions.<br />
<br />
As for detecting QuickTime, I'm not sure exactly what you'd look for.  I have iTunes w/ Quicktime, but in my registry, I don't seem to have anythig under HKLM\software\apple like I'd expect.  (But I know I have QuickTime becuase I can play QuickTime video.)<br />
<br />
And don't forget, there are many components of QuickTime so you'd probably need to look specifically for the component(s) that you need and not just QuickTime itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lel</div><div class="date">9th July 2006, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still bothering you, what I need is the standalone install<br />
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone.html<br />
<br />
Now I think the best way is as you suggested to add a page where I check (the funcion for checking is Quicktime version checker by Rob), but I don't know how to stop my installation<br />
(considering there's no way to wait for Quicktime to finish install) and don't allow the user to go on until my check determine that QuickTIme is intalled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">11th July 2006, 02:11</div></div><div class="posttext">... but I don't know how to stop my installation<br />
<br />
<br />
hmm...<br />
There's probably several ways to handle this, but here's a few of my suggestions:<br />
<br />
Option #1 (assumes a custom page for QT not installed):<br />
Display your custom &quot;quicktime is not installed&quot; page.  Then, in that page's callback function, issue the QUIT command.  This will stop the installation.<br />
<br />
(NOTE:<br />
The quit command will NOT allow any of your other callback functions to run (such as .onInstFailed).  If you require other cleanup functions to run when the installation quits, you'll need to wrap these instructions along with the Quit command inside your own function and then call your special function instead of just issuing a stand-alone quit command.)<br />
<br />
Option #2 (assumes you'll use just a MessageBox):<br />
Check for QuickTime during .onInit.  If not installed, perhaps just display a message box letting the user know what's going on followed by the abort command.  Probably something like this:<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
   ; *** [check for QuickTime here] ***<br />
   ; Pretend $0 = &quot;Y&quot; if Quicktime is installed<br />
   StrCmp $0 &quot;Y&quot; QT_YES QT_NO<br />
   QT_NO:<br />
      ; QuickTime is NOT installed:<br />
      MessageBox MB_OK &quot;QuickTime is NOT installed.$\rPlease install it.&quot;<br />
      abort<br />
<br />
   QT_YES:<br />
      ; quicktime is installed:<br />
      ; *** Continue your function here ***<br />
FunctionEnd</div></div><hr />
