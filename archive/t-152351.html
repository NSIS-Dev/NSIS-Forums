<br />
I just picked up the development snapshot and built my installer (after dealing with the latest required moving of page option settings), and I notice that my &quot;Welcome to the ... Wizard&quot; large bold text is clipped a *little* bit at the bottom (it runs to three lines).<br />
<br />
We are only talking about 1 or 2 rows of pixels, BTW. :)<br />
<br />
My Windows 2000 box is set to use &quot;Large fonts&quot; (120 dpi).  I use the &quot;MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION&quot; !define before all of my MUI_PAGE_* !insertmacro statements.<br />
<br />
A question about the &quot;MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION&quot; and &quot;MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC&quot; settings - do they do the same thing, and do either or both of them build a smaller installer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th October 2003, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">To make the text box on the welcome page larger, you should make a custom copy of ioSpecial.ini and edit the bottom key (think it's in Field 1)<br />
Then you can set the custom ini file by using:<br />
!define MUI_SPECIALINI &quot;${NSISDIR}\Path\To\myIOini.ini&quot;<br />
<br />
I think MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION removes the page descriptions (like e.g. &quot;here you enter the directory in which to install ${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot;), and MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC just removes the section descriptions.<br />
<br />

<br />
Using MUI_UI_NODESCRIPTION you can change the UI resource used by the MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC. Not using descriptions won't really make your installer smaller.</div></div><hr />

I just made some style changes, if you still have problems, let me know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That adjustment you made to the points/weight (or whatever you actually tweaked) worked out fine for me.<br />
<br />
I think that the reason this became a problem for me is that since the last release of my product at the end of July, you have &quot;collapsed&quot; MUI's separate product name and version strings into the single [non-MUI] &quot;Name&quot; directive, which took away some of my fine-grained control of when &quot;product&quot; is used and when &quot;product+version&quot; is used. :(<br />
<br />
It was never clear to me why you did this... but I have to assume you saw a need for it.<br />
<br />
So, in the end, I preferred the bigger font on the Welcome page, but with you now using the NSIS &quot;Name&quot; value (which for me is &quot;product+version&quot;), the field became too small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">13th October 2003, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You can still control where you want product and product+version. For example, you can set Name to product and Caption to product+version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RDaneel</div><div class="date">13th October 2003, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Once again, thanks, Joost!<br />
<br />
That was really what I was looking for... so you didn't really take away any fine-grained control, you just quit having special MUI control over Name and Caption.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you can go back to the larger font on the Welcome page now... :D</div></div><hr />

That's because XP wizards also use this font.</div></div><hr />
