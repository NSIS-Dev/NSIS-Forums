<br />
Does anyone know exactly what has to be done to add a connection to Dial-up-networking?  I have searched through MSDN for hours but it doesn't tell you anything about how DUN works.<br />
<br />
What API calls do I need to use?  What registry entries do I need to create?  How do I do it?</div></div><hr />

Although I've learned a bit about the System plug-in to make calls to API's, I don't know enough about that part, know nothing about the RAS API, and don't have time yet to get this working. But it looks like it would be a very useful feature :-)<br />
<br />
Incidently, if someone has working code to call an OCX, I would be very interested in knowing how to interact with the Sax modem OCX so I can dial out and connect to a BBS from a NSIS script...<br />
