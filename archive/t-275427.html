<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vc6</div><div class="date">6th August 2007, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I know about the built in variable for X:\Program Files during  installation: It is $PROGRAMFILES<br />
<br />
However, I need one for my development environment as well (my %HOMEDRIVE% is not C: but rather G:). Unfortunately $PROGRAMFILES does not expand at NSIS script compile-time.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to use system environment variables in an NSIS script? (I tried $HOMEDRIVE but it didn't work).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
<br />
Am I stupid or what? A few seconds after I posted this question I found the answer in the documentation: $HOMEDRIVE won't work, but $%HOMEDRIVE% works.<br />
<br />
I am happy now. :)</div></div><hr />
