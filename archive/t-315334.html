<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swizzley</div><div class="date">14th December 2009, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm writing an installer that needs to extract a few arj files at the end.  How would this be done?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing with a DOS unarj utility executed through a plugin like ExecDOS?  Anyone have any example code that might help me understand this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redxii</div><div class="date">14th December 2009, 05:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd use the 7zip command-line: http://www.7-zip.org/download.html<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$PLUGINSDIR&quot;<br />
File 7za.exe<br />
<br />
nsExec::Exec '&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\7za.exe&quot; x &quot;&lt;path to archive&gt;&quot; -y -o&quot;&lt;extraction path&gt;&quot;'<br />
<br />
Extracting the files and including them in your installer might also work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swizzley</div><div class="date">14th December 2009, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately this specific arj archive can't be opened with the command line version of 7zip, and including them in the installer is not an option.<br />
<br />
The archive can be opened with unarj, but the program is very limited (it will only extract the files to the directory it is in).<br />
<br />
The following works for me in Windows XP, but not in Vista.  I have RequestExecutionLevel admin set.<br />
<br />
Section -UNARJ<br />
SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
nsExec::execToLog '&quot;$INSTDIR\unarj.exe&quot; x REDNECK.INS'<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
On Vista it seems to just skip running the program as I get no feedback from it in the log.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swizzley</div><div class="date">15th December 2009, 00:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I just figured it out.  I'm running a 64 bit version of Windows Vista which unarj is not compatible with.<br />
<br />
I can think of a few workarounds, but none of them are very good... As I would like the install process to do everything automatically for the end user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redxii</div><div class="date">15th December 2009, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the command-line included with WinRAR (not their DOS one listed as a separate download). It's not a free program so I don't know if you would be allowed to include it in your installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">16th December 2009, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also try unrar.dll through the system plugin, but I never figured out how to make that work. If I remember correctly, I was unable to find documentation for the dll. Also I can't remember whether it's a free redistributable or not.<br />
<br />
Probably a better idea is to try unarj32.dll. It's Japanese, but it should be relatively well documented even in English.</div></div><hr />
