<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">4th December 2003, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">After updating my MUI-based installer to work with the 2.0b4 release, I found that one of my custom pages no longer worked properly.<br />
<br />
The custom page has a multiline text control. With the old NSIS compiler, long text strings did not wrap but with the new compiler they now wrap.<br />
<br />
I can stop the text from wrapping by enabling horizontal scrollbars but I do not want to do this.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to turn off word wrapping on a multiline text control which does not have scrollbars?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">4th December 2003, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah. I knew this would happen :(  The change in behaviour seemed to make sense at the time but I should have known there'd be cases where it wouldn't be right.  I'm working on InstallOptions at the moment so while I'm in there I'll add a NOWORDWRAP flag (or something like it) so that the behaviour can be controlled manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">5th December 2003, 03:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for adding the NOWORDWRAP flag so quickly - the new DLL solves my problem (tested on Win98SE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">5th December 2003, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh!  Thank's for testing it so quickly...  even before I'd got around to letting you know I'd done it!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">20th December 2003, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">As an experiment I tried using a Right-To-Left language in my installer and found a problem with the new NOWORDWRAP flag.<br />
<br />
When I tried to run my installer with this new language selected, I found that the new NOWORDWRAP flag did not have any effect on the multi-line read-only text controls on my custom pages. The text wraps when using a RTL language but does not wrap when using a LTR language.<br />
<br />
I'm using InstallOptions.dll v1.76 from the 19 December 2003 (20:44 GMT) CVS snapshot.<br />
<br />
This is NOT a problem for me at the moment as my installer only uses Left-To-Right languages (I just wanted to see how the new &quot;RTL&quot; setting for the custom page INI file worked).</div></div><hr />

I have changed test.nsi to be RTL, added NOWORDWRAP|DISABLED on the last field and it showed right. Can you please attach an example script?</div></div><hr />

When the InstallOptions\test.nsi script is compiled with RTL=0 the text control shows:Multiline wit<br />

and when RTL=1 the text control shows:<br />

Maybe it's something with WS_EX_RTLREADING and systems that don't support it... Can you test it with 1.73 (http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/nsis/NSIS/Plugins/InstallOptions.dll?rev=1.73) which didn't have WS_EX_RTLREADING?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">21st December 2003, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried rebuilding with 1.73 but it made no difference. I also tried everything from 1.73 to 1.76 with no luck.<br />
<br />
Attached is a zip file with two screen shots showing the problem and a test.exe built using 1.76 and RTL=1 in the INI file.<br />
<br />
Does the test.exe I built work on RTL Windows?</div></div><hr />
