<br />
With a ton of new features, some bug fixes, and a lot of changes to the way things work, this will be a handful. I hope we all like it though.<br />
<br />
For a 1.4 non-beta, I want to give us a good week or two, for plentiful testing, and spruce up the documentation a bit.<br />
<br />
-J<br />
<br />
Changes in this release:<br />
<br />
Note: many of the changes in this release will break previous scripts. Deal with it. It is for your own good.<br />
<br />
  Added maxlen parameter to StrCpy <br />
  Added GetFullDLLPath command/instruction <br />
  Added CompareDLLVersions command/instruction <br />
  Added CompareFileTimes command/instruction <br />
  Added leet callback functions <br />
  Added /oname= switch to File. <br />
  Label system (Goto values are no longer specified by number, but by labels, which are declared as Label:) <br />
  Added $OUTDIR variable <br />
  Made it so you could set $INSTDIR directly, using StrCpy/etc <br />
  Renamed Jump to Goto (and FindWindow's jump:label to goto:label). Change em all. <br />
  Removed $WAVISDIR and $WADSPDIR - you now should be able to implement these using ReadINIStr etc. <br />
  Made comments only started with ; not # (may break old scripts). <br />
  Made it so header commands cannot be declared inside functions/sections. <br />
  Massively reorganized compiler (now in one big-ass class) - hey, I got bored on the plane :) <br />
  Reduced the VM instruction size to 24 bytes from 28. <br />
  Reworked and optimized the Function system. <br />
  Rewrote and optimized and fixed recursive_create_directory (though no longer recursive, heh) <br />
  Updated zip2exe to work better with the new changes (WAVISDIR and WADSPDIR going away) <br />
  The documentation needs a lot more love.</div></div><hr />

Now i just gotta start begging for you to code in a way of getting an update file of a web server. :)<br />
Having that would help me and the 100-200 ppl that are going to be using NSIS from now on :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgewize</div><div class="date">23rd April 2001, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If you mean a way to download patches (not the original installer) via the web automatically, I'm almost done with that.<br />
<br />
If you want it integrated into the original installer, like one of those &quot;web install&quot; thingies, you'll have to wait for Justin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">24th April 2001, 00:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note.. if you downloaded it in the first hour after it was posted.. get it again. I fixed one bug that would basically occur if you did this:<br />
<br />
!ifdef crap<br />
Section MySection<br />
Poop:<br />
SectionEnd<br />
!endif<br />
<br />
and if crap was not defined, the line 'Poop:' would<br />
give error.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NickC</div><div class="date">24th April 2001, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Edgewize, id be very interested in it if it can be done as an NSIS routine atm, but my long term hope is that Justin will hear my pleas :) and actually intergrate it to NSIS.<br />
But when you finish your web updater make sure you post it here and chances are il use that for the moment as thats what we really need at MPZ.</div></div><hr />

Kinda like Wise's installation system (llok at the QuickTime 4.0 installer, for an example).</div></div><hr />
