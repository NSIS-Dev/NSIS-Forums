<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gregory.p.cliff</div><div class="date">28th October 2007, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I created an NSIS installer that works great (Thank goodness for NSIS)!  I would like to be able to run my installer from a Windows batch file with the silent option (/S) and have the batch file wait until the installer completes before proceeding on. My problem is that when I call the installer with the silent option (/S) it appears to go off on a separate thread and the batch file keeps on chugging.<br />
<br />
Is there any easy way to fix this?  Do I need to wrap one NSIS installer with another?  I read quite a few threads on the use of execWait with a _? parameter as related to running uninstallers.  Is that a or the solution.<br />
<br />
Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">28th October 2007, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the correct syntax would be:<br />
start /wait installer.exe /S<br />
or <br />
start &quot;&quot; /wait &quot;c:\some path\installer.exe&quot; /S <br />
if you need quotes (on NT)</div></div><hr />
