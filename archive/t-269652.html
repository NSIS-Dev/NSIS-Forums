<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">16th April 2007, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically I am looking for the answer to the question in the subject.  Specifically, I am installing matplotlib with NSIS but matpotlib needs MSVCP71.dll to run.  I know that if I put this file in the system or program directory then matplotlib will run, however, if the file is not there, it will not run.  Need to know if I'm allowed to grab this file from a Visual C++ installed computer and if so where I can put it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've googled for the MSVCP71.dll because I were not sure what it's for.<br />
<br />
I found out that it's a Runtime Library (MicrosoftÂ® C Runtime Library, v. 7.10.3077.0) which you can download for free from the web.<br />
<br />
I don't think there would be a problem when you redistribute it, but maybe the safer way would be to install a full C Runtime for your application (Maybe you need the other files later).<br />
<br />
Maybe this (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/abx4dbyh(vs.71).aspx) link can help you.<br />

I know you can download it freely from the web but I don't want to breach any microsoft laws by distributing it.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
