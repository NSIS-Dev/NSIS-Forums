<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coolmeen</div><div class="date">15th May 2011, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">hey guys.<br />
after many hours of coding my installer is finished, thx for all the help!<br />
1 small problem is that when i m writing to reg(Software\Microsoft\windows\currentVersion\run) the startup with windows path the avg<br />
vicious anti virus detects it as a threat...<br />
i tried running all of kind of downlded installers(flashget an etc ..) with the same function and the ang havn't responded to those installer as threat.<br />
if you would be kind to help it would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highcoder</div><div class="date">15th May 2011, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">AV engines uses 2 different types to classify a file. The first one is to compare the &quot;fingerprint&quot; of known malware with your file. The other one is the heuristic. It scans the &quot;behavior&quot; of your file and check how many &quot;good&quot; and how many &quot;bad&quot; operations it does. And if the &quot;bad&quot; things reaches a certain percentage than the file get classified as malware.<br />
<br />
Write do the autostart registry key is such &quot;bad&quot; thing. But your installer must do more bad things than that because writing to that key only normally doesn´t trigger the AV alert. <br />
<br />
So for more help we need to see your code...<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">15th May 2011, 22:52</div></div><div class="posttext">it's probably unrelated, but i recently noticed that all of my old installers where classified as malware by most antivirus scanners. what made it so bad, was the fact i was using upack header compression. switched to upx and got no more problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T.Slappy</div><div class="date">16th May 2011, 06:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry about it...<br />
AVG is not good anti-virus, it shows a large of false alarms. try to scan your file with Eset or other tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">16th May 2011, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">AVG has a huge userbase, so if it flags his installer as a virus that is a genuine problem that must be solved. Not worrying about it is not going to help doing that. Suggesting he just ignore the problem seems a rather pointless thing to do...<br />
<br />
Coolmeen, one thing you could try is submitting a false positive report to grisoft: http://samplesubmit.avg.com/us-en/false-detection<br />
<br />
I don't know if they're willing to adjust their heuristics engine to accommodate invasive NSIS installers, but you can give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coolmeen</div><div class="date">16th May 2011, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah.. i dont think my inst will qualify to &quot;mama tereza's&quot; installer award..<br />
with the user's permission it sets a custom home page on the diffrerent browsers as many other installers..<br />
and theres the question, all the other &quot;innocent&quot; installers submit there program to the anti-viruses observation for false positive?<br />
any way , surprisingly i tried reposition the reg key adding to another function/section and it worked like magic.<br />
thx alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highcoder</div><div class="date">16th May 2011, 09:47</div></div><div class="posttext">muhahaha... &quot;mama tereza´s&quot; installer award... :-)<br />
<br />
Yup, sometimes you only need small changes in code. And before you release your installer you should test it with a online malware scanner like jottis or virus total...<br />
<br />
@Yatosho<br />
<br />
Header compression very often causes false positives (UPX too). So i don´t use them...<br />
For my interest: Why do you use exe head packer? It can´t be the compression ratio. The filesize decrease is absolutely insignificant (in case you do an installer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coolmeen</div><div class="date">17th May 2011, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">lol!<br />
avast is so stupid that when i defined the installers icon it recognized it as a threat..<br />
the sec i change the icon size it cooled down...<br />
so idiotic</div></div><hr />
