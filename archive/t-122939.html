<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrtech</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 06:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but after search for well over an hour in the forum, I still can't find my answer, here goes.<br />
<br />
How can I save the InstType of the last install so that I can preselect that InstType the next time the user is upgrading?<br />
<br />
Additionally, how can I do the same with the Setions?<br />
<br />
I know I can write to the reg or ini, but I couldn't find a complete example that says:<br />
<br />
- read registry<br />
- if value, preselect insttype<br />
- if insttype change, write registry<br />
- install<br />
<br />
FYI, I've already got code in the .onInit set flags for a Silent install.<br />
<br />
Any help would be very much so appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mel</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't have custom type then you can simply add a hidden section for each installation type that will set the registry key. If you do have custom type it will be a bit trickier. For that you have to either write 1 to an INI or the registry for each section that was selected inside the section itself or iterate on all of the sections using SectionGetFlags and prepering a string of zeros and ones. When starting the installer next time you can set the section flags according to this list.</div></div><hr />
