<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rayc</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to upgrade a very old application and I'm using NSIS to create my installer. The problem I'm currently having is that after I run my installer, the old version of the program still appears in the Add/Remove programs of Control Panel.<br />
<br />
I don't have access to the Windows Registry of my computer, because of security reasons, the company where I work won't allow it. So I can't get the uninstall information. I think the old app was installed using Installshield but I can't find the ODEUNST.LOG file.<br />
<br />
Is there another way of getting the uninstall information from the computer?<br />
And if so, how can I remove the entry using NSIS script?<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />

if its regedit you cant run get a copy of some other registry program or find a copy <br />
of bart pe or any pe bootable cd that will let you access the registry files on the root c: drive and edit them. (not responsible if you get fired :) )</div></div><hr />
