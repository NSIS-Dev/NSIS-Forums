<br />
I want to be able to have my installer suggest the program install location, that feature is already part of MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE..., however I also want to on that same page ideally to suggest a location for user files.  Currently I have been offering just, as a default, c:\program files\bpq32 for everything, but for Vista/Windows 7 of course I will split the files into program files and user data files, the later likely $APPDATA\bpq32.  <br />
<br />
Secondly I would like to offer the choice to the user of installing for 'all users' or for 'current user'.<br />
<br />
Hopefully macros are already available to easily do these things?</div></div><hr />

There's an excellent readme in the nsDialogs readme: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/nsDialogs/Readme.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ron.Stordahl</div><div class="date">5th August 2011, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks..but I was hoping to save precious time by finding the needed pages ready made.  If I have to I will of course do as you suggest.  Hopefully someone reading this may have what I want or know where to get it.<br />
<br />
Or where might I look for something a user may have submitted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">5th August 2011, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, for the second directory, you can just add a second DIRECTORY page. Use MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE_VARIABLE.<br />
<br />
Making a custom page for alluser/single install is easy. Following the tutorial will get you most of the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This problem exists on every version of NT, not just NT6, you are just not testing as non-admin...</div></div><hr />
