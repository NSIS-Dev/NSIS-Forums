<br />
Quick comment/question. nsExec - do things run by it run as a child process of the installer (so in the event of an installer crash, the child processes will not be left running on the system)? I had to kill an install process during an nsExec call, and it left the called process still running.<br />
<br />
What happens in that case, and how can I make sure that the system is left tidy even in the (unlikely) event of a crash.<br />
<br />
I know the answer is to never let it crash, but it wasn't an error in my code that was the problem. Plus it's better to code defensively :)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />

If nsExec or the installer commit suicide, the running process will be left as is. I think it's better than killing yet another process and it's most definitely simpler.</div></div><hr />
