<br />
I'm attempting to build an installer which i would like to keep as dynamic as possible by either declaring a bunch of globals and reading from them or simply getting the info from an ini file.<br />
<br />
I keep getting the following message every time i try to use any sort of useful command at the top of my code:<br />
<br />
Error: command not valid outside section or function<br />
<br />
Now, i understand exactly what it means i would just like to know how to get around this.<br />
<br />
For example i'd like to have a dynamic variable which would allow me to change the Name, BrandingName, OutFile etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">As the error says you can't use run time instructions outside a Section or a Function.<br />
<br />
For example, StrCpy is a run time instruction, so you can't use it outside a Section or Function for compile time purposes.<br />
<br />
If you need to execute NSIS run time code at compile time, see this article:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rudif</div><div class="date">23rd August 2006, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that you mentioned it, the distinction between compile-time tools (use macros!) and run time tools (use functions!) becomes clear.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; As the error says you can't use run time instructions outside a Section or a Function.<br />
<br />
I think that error diagnostic does not say exactly that, but probably it should. Newbies would appreciate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">24th August 2006, 05:43</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not a matter of whether to use macros or functions.  Macros can be used inside of function just fine.<br />
<br />
The actual error is a result of trying to use a run-time command outside of a function.<br />
<br />
For example, ReadIniStr is a runtime function.  You could include this command in a macro and that would still be legal.<br />
<br />
If you then used !insertmacro to insert that macro outside of any function or section, you would recieve the error.  But, if you used the same !insertmacro call from within a function or section, then the compiler would be perfectly happy.<br />
<br />
The general rule is that anything in the help files under &quot;instructions&quot; (section 4.9) should be considered a runtime instruction.<br />
<br />
If all this seems confusing, my recommendation would be to study the examples and start experimenting with some simple scripts of your own.  Eventually, it'll all make sense.  I know because I was once a newbie, too! ;)</div></div><hr />
