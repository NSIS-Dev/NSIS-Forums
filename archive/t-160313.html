for a while, it worked. Now, whenever I update, it just stays as Initializing CVS update and does not do anything else.<br />
<br />
Any help is welcomed.</div></div><hr />

It's must be the SourceForge CVS problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm... it is weird. It updates some files then just hang there doing nothing, seems like the update is done but the buttons are not enabled. Perhaps a timeout function would be nice. Had to go to task manager every time to end the task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it is due to the slowness of it. For example, I just updated again, and I got below:<br />
<br />
Initializing CVS Update...<br />
U Examples/Modern UI/Basic.nsi<br />
P Source/exehead/exec.c<br />
P Source/exehead/util.c<br />
<br />
Following which, it just stops there. Nothing else happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes. the files are updated alright. What I am saying is, and has been talking about is what happens AFTER the files are updated. The Finished button does not appear, none of the two buttons are enablad. I have to go to Task Manager to end the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th December 2003, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just slow. NSIS Update simply calls cvs95.exe, nothing else. NSIS Update is just a wrapper for the CVS client which connects to SourceForge's CVS server to update your files. Just give it time, sometimes it can even take 10 minutes to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">20th December 2003, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">it would be also very nice, if the update tool would write &quot;ready&quot; Ã­nto its log-windows, after all files had been updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">20th December 2003, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">It enables the button and shows 'Task completed' when the update is finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">20th December 2003, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">i know, but i think it'd perhaps nice if it says &quot;ready&quot; and gives an &quot;exit&quot;-button and an &quot;restart&quot;/&quot;retry&quot; button, that is needed, if it fails, or for people, that don't want to restart the program everytime.</div></div><hr />
