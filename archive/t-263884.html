<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gozzgug</div><div class="date">17th January 2007, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a vendor that has found a 127 MSP limit using windows installer, (MSI/MSPs). We get MSP patches from them frequently for updates. We reach the 127 MSP limit very quickly and are having a hard time dealing with this limitation.<br />
<br />
Does NSIS support patching in a similar way to MSI and if so can it handle more than 127 patches being applied to an existing install? Is there a limit?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i guess you could write a script that supports far more than 127 patch installations.<br />
but as i said: you'd have to write the complete patching script, you do not have a GUI to click such things together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You also can repack the deliverd MSI package yourself with e.g. MAKEMSI http://www.dennisbareis.com<br />
<br />
And yes, you could also use NSIS and VPatch theoretically, but whatever your choose, it is still a lot of work.<br />
<br />
IMHO: <br />
It's really better to ask the vendor to learn how to use MSI correctly. This situation should normally never occur with propper MSI packages.</div></div><hr />
