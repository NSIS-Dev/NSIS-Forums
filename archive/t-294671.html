<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domipheus</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering what people think about the way long strings are handled. First off, I have not looked extensively to see if it is already a feature. I tried searching, but found nothing on the first 3 pages of results. Its to do with Path Manipulation specifically, but something that could be needed generally.<br />
<br />
I've just spent a good while (a few hours) trying to figure out why an installer I wrote was totally trashing a small amount of Path environment variables on client machines. It would simply say the Path variable was empty, and then overwrite it with the directory I wanted. It took me ages to discover that is was simply the path variable on his/her computer being longer than 1024 characters. On a development machine, this length can easily be exceeded. I'm only 50 characters under this limit myself.<br />
<br />
This is dangerous on so many levels!<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have the installer totally bomb out when this happens? Trying to reconstruct path environment variables takes forever when you have numerous SDK's and build environments etc. <br />
<br />
I really do consider this a huge flaw in the way nsis does this. There should be some sort of way to handle a string overflowing, even if it does totally stop the installer. An installer should never trash a machine, if in doubt - don't install.<br />
<br />
I'm now using the long string build of makensis which is working nicely, but I do think string error handling could be good.</div></div><hr />

Already am, see bottom of post.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you check the length of a string, if the returned value is nil because its too long? :D</div></div><hr />
