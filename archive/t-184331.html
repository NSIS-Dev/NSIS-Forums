When i download something , that uses the NSIS installer , i always get the &quot;NSIS Error&quot;(corrupted) message!<br />
I'm positively sure the problem is either my PC, or a conflict with NSIS software.<br />
Any advice on what might i do to fix this annoyance?<br />
<br />
P.S. One of my big problems, is with Eve-Online , like Mkfish , but this time the Eve-Online installer(which uses NSIS)says its corrupted, thought im positively sure its ok!<br />
<br />
EDIT - I'm absolutely sure it's not a virus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xionor</div><div class="date">23rd June 2004, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not corrupted on the server.<br />
But I finally figured out how to use /NCRC (before i used to type it with non-caps , so thats why it didnt work). Well the installation started, but it gave &quot;corrupted&quot; error messages on different places. Sometimes it would show the error on the main exe file, then on the stuff files.It just kept giving out random error messages. I think it's my HDD....gotta change it. One advice to you all : DON'T BUY SEAGATE HARD DRIVES!!! . They're extremely buggy(at least the 40GB ones).Many friends who have it, have problems with files, just like me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll redownload the file, and hopefully, this time it will install.<br />
<br />
But...im wondering, why do i get the &quot;file corrupted&quot; error message on EVERY , nsis installer?</div></div><hr />

Very often getting them to download from an alternate download site corrected the problem.  Not sure if you're able to do that in your case but thought I'd toss in my experiences.<br />
<br />
Knowing some more of the specs about your system may help to understand why the installers aren't running for you.  i.e. What OS, do you have latest Windows updates installed, etc.<br />
