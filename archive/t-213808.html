<br />
I am trying to create a generic installer. We have a lot of projects that needs to be installed, so I am hoping to write on template installer that can read in the following information Dyanmically<br />
<br />
- Name<br />
- OutFile<br />
- InstallDir<br />
<br />
I am new to NSIS. So I tried many different ways to change the values for these variables in .onInit and in Section. But I guess these variables can be declared in Functions nor Sections.<br />
<br />
Any advice will be great!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

<br />
Code in Sections and Functions are only executed on run-time, so it isn't possible to set the OutFile for example, on run-time (because it has to be called on compile-time to create the installer in the first place!)<br />

I just tested the example that you showed it. However, since Version.txt is am empty text file, part 2 wont compile. If I run part 1, which will create some text in Version.txt, part 2 is compiled the text in Version.txt. If I update the version for MyFile.exe, it will be showing the compiled version instead of the updated version.<br />
<br />
I want to change the Name, InstallDir, etc. by changing some text file (txt, ini, etc.). I want to make a generic installer that will pull in the info from the text without having to compile everytime.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
All you should need to do is modify the first install (GetVersion.EXE) to read the name, outfile, and installdir values from either a txt or ini file and then write it back out as a header file.  <br />
<br />
Your main script then calls 2 things:<br />
<br />
!system &quot;GetVersion.exe&quot;<br />
!include &quot;Version.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The !system command tells the compiler to execute GetVersion.EXE, which then creates &quot;Version.txt&quot;.  (Version.txt would then include name, outfile, and installdir.)  The !include then includes version.txt as a part of the main script.<br />
<br />
Since name and outfile are both compile-time commands, you'll still have to compile your main script each time to incorporate them.  But, you'd still have the flexibility of being able to simply modify a text file and then create a new install.<br />
<br />
And MakeNSIS can be command-line driven, so if you still wanted to automate the compile process, you could. (See Chapter 3 of the NSIS help manual for details about MakeNSIS usage.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. :)</div></div><hr />
