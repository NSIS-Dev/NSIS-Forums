How about to make a GUI, i think itÂ´s a good idea.<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PabUK</div><div class="date">1st April 2001, 03:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about making one but I don't have the time. Anyone else care to give it a try? It would be very difficult to keep up with all the new versions of NSIS but it would give those people put off by scripts a nice system to work with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">1st April 2001, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea, a GUI. But at the moment, I don't have time to create it. It would't be too hard - but it depends on what you want in there.<br />
<br />
First, you need a page with some generic settings (SetCompress, SetDateSave, etc).<br />
Then you need a page with the different sections (a list), and you can modify them. But in such a program, you can't do anything 'cool' with if-statements and such, because it's too complex.<br />
<br />
I'll think about it. Is anyone else already working on this? I can't start for another 3 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PabUK</div><div class="date">1st April 2001, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't mind helping out if I have the time, but I only program in Visual Basic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bor</div><div class="date">1st April 2001, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I also thought of it. But if you program it you got to keep in mind the constant adding of features. I mostly program in Delphi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">1st April 2001, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I can do both Visual Basic and Delphi. But creating a good design is very important.<br />
It should contain 'macro' functionality, for example, you can set for an OCX file 'Register' and then it's automatically added to the script. Same for version checking (but that's not implemented in NSIS yet).<br />
<br />
After Easter, I'll have time to work on it. Personally, I'd go with Delphi because it doesn't require all those pesky Micro$oft Runtimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RM</div><div class="date">9th April 2001, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I started to program a NSIS Gui.<br />

If anyone want to join this small project, you are welcomed to contact me:<br />

<br />
I too have started an NSIS project, but not a GUI. Its called NSIS Assistant and is just for editing the script files and compiling them without having to copy makensis everytime you create a setup for a new project.</div></div><hr />

I'm using Visual C++ .<br />
<br />
I thought making the GUI as a wizard.<br />
<br />
If anyone has ideas for the gui, please mail me....<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">10th April 2001, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">A wizard is nice, but you should be able to save your project, and open up the wizard again later (to add some files, etc).<br />
<br />
You could make a wizard with Tab pages, where every page is a step, so you can easily switch between steps.<br />
Ease of use is important.<br />
<br />
But more important is maintaining script integrity. If you make a change to an existing script, it shouldn't mess up the script.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts. I can't help because I don't know C++. Isn't a 'lower-level' language like VB or Delphi easier for these 'GUI-oriented' applications?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">10th April 2001, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely you would create a project file that would store the settings in a standard format your program can read.  Then it could generate the script.  But unless you are buiding some type of parser, it wouldnt be able to read .nsi files.  It would be sort of a nsi compiler that compiles project files to .nsi not the other way around.</div></div><hr />

It's definetely not a gui, but it's close to a wizard :)<br />
<br />
http://www.easynsigenerator.da.ru<br />
<br />
It's done in... believe it or not... Pascal Turbo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm helping Kaboon get in a real GUI... so far, it does the basics... not very extensible though. As of yet, you can only get in a max of 64 installation files, but it's a start. In VB (yes... ms runtimes are evil, but it's all I know). When Kaboon decides to release it, you can all see it.<br />
<br />
Sadly, you can't pick up where you left of.</div></div><hr />

I had no trouble at all getting my NSIS script up and running.  The provided documentation was enough to get me started.<br />
I read through MakeNSIS.html and the examples before I got started.  This way I was familiar with NSIS's abilities and the way it worked.<br />
<br />
With a GUI your installation script will only be as powerful as the GUI allows it to be.  Further &quot;touching&quot; up can be done by hand, of course, but at that point why not write the whole thing from scratch?<br />
<br />
What would be more useful is a bunch of generic templates for people to use.  (such as full working scripts with a few variables for them to change)  This would help the newcomers by giving them a head start and allow them to add/modify as they see fit.  And better yet, you won't be limited by a GUI and bothered with updating it with every NSIS release.  In my opinion I think this serves a better purpose.</div></div><hr />

---<br />
So you do your programming using a DOS-Console and with makefiles, instead of (for expample) viaual studio or somthing? ;) <br />
Of course a GUI for NSIS must support script editing by hand, and of course there is no real need for a GUI when making trivial/little installers.<br />
Imagine a installer for about 600 files and 90 folders - would you want to type all the SetOutDir/File etc commands by hand?<br />
<br />
If you have no need for a GUI - fine, but I think that the existing of this thread proves, that other users have.</div></div><hr />

In some cases a GUI can be time-saving and practical.  But I think the main reason for a demand lies in the fact that some people don't want to make the effort and spend the time to write their own script.  They just want to click a few buttons in a wizard-guided interface and be done with it.<br />
<br />
It just surprises me that someone would take the time to write a piece of software and not take the time to learn NSIS to package it.  The script only has to be written once (and in some cases modifed from time to time) so it's not a big headache.  (it was a breeze to write my first script (using ver. 1.h) and I have enjoyed adding new features to it when new versions of NSIS came out)  This is why I think templates would come in handy.. it would allow the lazy folks to modify a few strings/variables and be done with it.  (but maybe I am wrong, who knows.. maybe there are more point-and-click folks out there than I thought)</div></div><hr />

I agree with that - but in this context your posting sounds to me like you want to punish those guys.<br />
I am often angry with my clients as they dont read the docs and calling our support hotline instead, wasting their time with asking &quot;stupid&quot; questions, but is that a reason for removing all the docs from our products?<br />
As you said, GUIs can be practical and time saving, so lets focus on that o make our life a little easier:)</div></div><hr />

I didn't meant to come across that way at all!  :D <br />
It's just that most NSIS users are developers and most developers are not the wizard interface point-and-click types.<br />
Either way it's great to see others making an effort towards making NSIS an easier, more user-friendly application.<br />
<br />
(um, if I didn't make any sense it's because I am wasted right now.. I just came back from the bar.  !!!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ad 1: Maybe I am not a real developer, because I like to create new Methods by rightclicking the class using the context menu, and I like juming direktly to the desired function in a 7000 lines class using a combobox with autolocator :D <br />
Ad 2: I agree with that, but maybe you're right with 1. since there are no requests according to my GUI from the forum members so far.<br />
I can live with that - less testers means less work for me ;)</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should take a look at this file before you proceed.<br />
This GUI ist nearly finished and primarly needs some beta testing before it gets a &quot;1.00&quot; version number.<br />

So maybe I should stop developing NSISplus and wait for your results?:D <br />
My aim is not to replace the need of a text editor but to reduce its need, because I cant see how a GUI can do all the things possible in NSIS without using a text editor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I want a gui where u dont need to know anything about scripting when u create a simple installer ( there is such a wizard tool somewhere i've seen)<br />
<br />
i also want to have real language support :<br />
just choose from a listview a language module (nsh file)<br />
where the texts are in, so it would be better I think<br />
(u dont need to know what Completedttext or so is exactly)<br />
<br />
the next one : i can drag n drop files i want into my prog and then double click for extra options like destdir or renaming or for dlls replace after reboot or so<br />
<br />
ok i need a function editor but thats only for experts<br />
<br />
i'll try to add standards like a reboot option or a startmenu chooser<br />
<br />
like in professional installers - maybe i dont get it working but i try<br />

your version of a gui is a complete other way best wishes but I try an other way ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I want a gui where u dont need to know anything about scripting when u create a simple installer<br />
Did you realy take a look t NSISplus?<br />
For a simple installer you need these steps:<br />
1. Select File/New, choose a name --&gt; you will get a ready for use framework<br />
2. Open the main section and D&amp;D the file you want to install on the OutDir item<br />
3. Press F5 (compile)<br />
<br />
i also want to have real language support :<br />
just choose from a listview a language module (nsh file)<br />
where the texts are in, so it would be better I think<br />
I would prefer using different templates for that, because a) editing is easier (just one file) and b) transporting the installer scripts is easier (I use to work alternately on my PC and my Vaio, and som of my projects are develpoed in groups, so even more computers are included)<br />
<br />
When do you expect to publish a beta that shows how you GUI will work?</div></div><hr />

i also use different includes for language support<br />
u can select your fav one from a listbox<br />
<br />
one for each language (only german at the moment)<br />
what my prog does is :<br />
<br />
drag n drop of files in the listview<br />
ability for own functions ( real scripting)<br />

guis for general, files options , dir options and so on<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 06:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to post a new subject about a NSIS editor I created called Venis (http://www.mandato.com/venis/).  Well I found this forum and I hope the creation of my editor does not upset anyone.<br />
<br />
Venis key features:<br />
*Syntax highlighting of key words. <br />
*Compiler output view. <br />
*File tools (saving, open, close, print). <br />
*Edit tools (copy, paste, cut, select all). <br />
*Compiler execution and final program execution for testing.<br />
<br />
I decided on an SDI (Single Document Interface) because typically you are only working with one NSI file.  I did allow multiple instances of the program to be opened.  There is a compile results view, a tool bar, and the typical tools most IDE's have (Find, Replace, Goto...).  Tomorrow (Thrusday, May 13, 2002) I will post the first release.<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Thanks! <br />
Some feedback:<br />
* My system is not located on C: and my programms are not installed in &quot;program files&quot;, so any of your attempts to open MSIE directly fails with an error message.<br />
Hint: Using ShellExecute(hwnd, &quot;open&quot;, &lt;path to html file&gt;, ...) will work on all systems.<br />
* makeNSIS can be found via registry instead of asking the user for its location.<br />
* When makeNSIS fails e.g. with &quot;file not found - aborting creation process&quot;, then the script was NOT compiled successfully, even if  venis reports this ;)<br />
* Using SDI is OK, but you should add the possibility to load more than one file, because the user surely wants to copy some code from other install scripts, when creating a new script. I suggest adding a button line at the bottom of the window to switch between the loaded files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">16th March 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome!  Hey do not be afraid to give me more suggestions.   I originally thought of some kind of tabbing system for multiple files but opted to design with just one single file.<br />
<br />
Using myself at work, I was thinking about making a feature that would leave the file you last opened and keeping the same cursor position.<br />
<br />
I think I am going to make a forum/feature request page on the Venis website so others can request features.<br />
<br />
I want to make a feature to load different word files for the older builds of NSIS. <br />
<br />
If anyone has developed with Power++, I want to create a toolbar that can allow drag and drop programming.  I may make an example with File and MessageBox functions and see if others would like this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Next version of Venis will include unique features which will allow fast editing and development of NSIS scripts.  Look for it in a month or two.<br />

Thanks everyone for the input!<br />
