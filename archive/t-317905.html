<br />
コピー ～some file.txt  (コピー ～ simply means &quot;copy of&quot;).<br />
<br />
I am running on the English version of XP pro.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround or a pluging that can help me with this?<br />
<br />
I have a fairly large group of Japaneses and Chinese files to include in my installer.</div></div><hr />

I would still like to know if I could accomplish the same thing with the &quot;Official&quot; version.</div></div><hr />

It's simply a limitation of NSIS still being ANSI-based: it can only work with filenames that can be expressed in the non-Unicode character set used by the system.<br />
<br />
You can change the language to use for non-Unicode programs under Regional and Language Settings in the control panel, but unless your Chinese names happen to only be using characters which can also be expressed in the Japanese locale, you can't do it.<br />
<br />
Just use Unicode NSIS for now - it's the simplest way to deal with this kind of scenario, and it's also much easier to test, because you're removing the dependency on that setting, and can test on any Windows machine (that the installer can run on).</div></div><hr />
