<br />
There are lines for:<br />
InstType &quot;Full&quot;<br />
InstType &quot;Lite&quot;<br />
InstType &quot;Minimal&quot;<br />
<br />
The above are types 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Within each section, there will be a &quot;SectionIn&quot; that reflects whether this Section is part of that &quot;Type&quot; of installation.<br />
<br />
If I understand your question, I believe this is one way to proceed.<br />
<br />

<br />
thank you for your answer but it isn't really that that I want ...<br />
<br />
I have an exe in order to install different software.<br />
<br />
And in this exe, the user can select automatic or manual install :<br />
   * if automatic : the user select the software that he want and they are automatically install (silence install; he can't choose the directory)<br />
   * if manual : the user select the software that he want to install and my exe execute setup after setup (so he do to tape next next ... and the directory of install for all the software).<br />
<br />
if i create this it is because i have many software in my exe and if the user want to install all of them, he do to choose the directory of install of each softaware and one after one; so he must be next he computer. <br />
<br />
Also, if he choose the automatic install, he do &quot;install&quot; and it is all ...<br />
<br />
Have you uderstand with my bad english ?? :D</div></div><hr />

Examples\InstallOptions\test.nsi is a good example to start from.<br />
<br />
BTW, have you tried the French forum (http://www.winampfr.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=24)?</div></div><hr />
