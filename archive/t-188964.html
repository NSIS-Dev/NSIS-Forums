<br />
I am having a problem deleting unicode registry entries (Japanese, Arabic, etc) using DeleteRegKey.<br />
<br />
I traced the problem into the code, Source\exehead\exec.c function myRegDeleteKeyEx, I found that the fucntion RegEnumKey is not returning the key name properly. The problem appears on XP Home and 2000, but it doesn't appear on XP pro. I know this is a limitation from RegEnumKey because it is not designed to handle unicode entries, but that means that our beloved NSIS installer is unable to handle unicode registry entries as well.<br />
<br />
I writting this post hoping that someone out there went through the same problem and found a solution for it, or maybe someone can come up with an idea to solve this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
