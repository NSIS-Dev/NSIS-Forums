<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">todd_run</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to be able to completely hide a section and have it not presented in the components page.  Whether or not this section should be made available is based on the current registry settings.  Therefore, the script can determine before the components page is called whether this section should be available.<br />
<br />
I see that it's possible to make the section unselected and read only.  But, instead of showing an option that the user can not activate, I'd rather have it not appear at all. <br />
<br />
Is this possible?  If so, how would I remove (or add) an entire section from the components page?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">30th June 2005, 08:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Really the expected behaviour here is that the section still appeared but had no text, but NSIS somehow interprets &quot;&quot; as &quot;hide that damn thing&quot;. Maybe SectionShow [0|1] would be better, that way you don't need to keep the section text around in  a !define.</div></div><hr />
