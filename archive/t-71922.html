<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I hate looking at the DOS box so much, and its a pain to copy the output without redirecting it, I wrote a simple wrapper for makensis that will run in a Window.  I've attached the source and executables.  The wrapper works well when you use it with the extensions (you just need to update them to makensisw.exe and makensis-bz2w.exe).<br />
<br />
The only part of the nsis source I changed was moving the NSIS-VERSION string into version.c so I could retrieve the nsis version.  The wrapper is in source/makensisw.  The makefile is for mingw so you'll have to write your own for v c++.<br />
<br />
To install, extract the zip file you your nsis directory.  To install/upgrade the extensions, run makensis on the installext.nsi file and run the installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an updated version that does not need to be compiled for each makensis (makensis.exe, makensis-bz2.exe, etc).  You will need to compile and install installext.nsi to setup the correct extensions since the format has changed.<br />
<br />
Now you say:<br />
makensisw.exe makensis.exe [options] [script.nsi | - [...]]<br />
<br />
Where makensis.exe (or makensis-bz2.exe) is in the same directory as makensisw.exe.<br />

<br />
Very useful!<br />
<br />
Thank you! :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbareis</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I was hoping to use it for a different purpose (I suppose the source is there)...<br />
<br />
I was hoping I would be able to execute any command and that there would be a find option.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to execute commands like:<br />
<br />
    dir<br />
<br />
That failed so I tried:<br />
<br />
    %comspec% /c dir<br />
<br />
That also failed because it added &quot;c:\tmp\&quot; to the start of the command making it invalid (C:\tmp\C:\WINNT\system32\cmd.exe /c dir). <br />
<br />
A switch or simply looking for slashes in the first part would solve this...<br />
Since I started a wish list I might as well also add that being able to size the window would be nice as would a &quot;wrap&quot; option (no horizontal scrolling).<br />
<br />
Anyway just an idea, I'll check the utility again in future and have a look at the source when and if I find the time if I need to.<br />
Bye<br />
Dennis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I've added the ability to save the output.    I had never thought of a search, but I guess that's possible, although I don't see the need.<br />
<br />
I can add a word wrap option if anyone needs it.<br />
<br />
It was designed only for makensis, if you want to execute any command then you will need to change the source.<br />
<br />
If you want the updated source, just send me an email.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreft</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">just out of curiosity what is so wrong with using a dos window for the 10 or less seconds it takes to compile an installer? and is it so wrong that it prompted the building of this wrapper? i am just curious because i dont see a practical purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't generally mind, except sometimes I want to capture the output.  And I could pipe the output to a file, but I don't really feel like doing that every time I get an error in the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to say, that I wrote this to use as the windows extension.  When you are compiling from a DOS box, you don't need a windows version, but when you right click a file and choose compile then I think that the windows version is more usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I've updated the wrapper again.  I added a menu option to recompile the script as well as fixed a few small bugs.  Send me an email if you want the source/executable.<br />

Yes please, however I don't have your email address and your profile won't allow emails to be sent to you...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">21st January 2002, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">ok for my first look the wrapper is quite ok so<br />

<br />
I'm using mingw so its possible vc throws some errors.  I don't have VC installed on this machine (cause I never use it anymore), but I will install it later tonight and have a look.  It shouldn't be difficult to fix because the code is all pure win32.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you get the latest version here (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nsisext/makensisw-setup-0.4.zip).<br />
