<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlexanderG</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine this has already been asked, but I can't find it.<br />
How do I change the size of the display area of the license text box? I have already resized the installer window (with Resource Hacker) but the text box is still very small (it is taking up about 1/3 of the available space)<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlexanderG</div><div class="date">27th April 2005, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">That's perfect thanks.<br />
Where could I find documentation of which sections of the *.exe files control which sections of the MUI pages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">27th April 2005, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you just look at all the dialogues you should be able to match them up.<br />
<br />
The MUI Welcome and Finish page's are not in the UI. They are both made from InstallOptions custom pages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I really really think and would love the idea of a resizable installer... Either fixed or dynamic. Fixed could be set likeMUI_SIZE '780x540'Dynamic well, I wouldn't worry too much about :)<br />
<br />
All screens on the installer regardless of size will always have the same header and footer height. The header and footer will also remain at the top and bottom of the installer. This being the case NSIS should really have no worry in the world about things being out of place as long as the header and footer stretch width wise without problems.<br />
<br />
Other screens like license and readme benefit greatly from this as they seem to be cramped even with an agree button. Also, new custom screens can be made, and lengthy form type screens can be better shortened and better organized with greater screen real estate. I really can't see how an amazing application like NSIS can't at least try to offer a native option on this...<br />
<br />
If it's hard, how hard can it really be? Just curious.<br />
<br />
What do you think Kichik?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">This requires script commands that enable the user to edit the dialogs at compile time. It's possible, the infrastructure is already written. I've had plans to create such commands, but I never got to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">If you focused on it and got to work on it, about how long would it take you to complete a working version? hypothetically...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">It'll take a couple of hours to get the commands to change the dialogs ready. However, I don't know how the MUI can allow arbitrary sizes to be set. It'll need to calculate the sizes at compile time. That's currently only possible using an external application. It can use some defines to select from a set selection of sizes, but that's already possible now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">It can use some defines to select from a set selection of sizes, but that's already possible now.What do you mean &quot;already possible&quot;? Do you mean the MUI can be set a preset size bigger or smaller than currently by default? How?<br />
<br />
It's also good to know it'll only take a couple hours to complete, should I enter in a feature request at SF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">It's already possible because you can already create some set UIs and use them using MUI_UI. The MUI can add some defines line MUI_LARGER_UI and MUI_SMALLER_UI which will use those UIs. There is no need for new commands for set sizes.<br />
<br />
A lot of things will take only a couple of hours. It's on my todo but so are a lot of other things. You can create a feature request so others will also see it. Someone might want to implement it, though I doubt it. I don't recall ever receiving a patch for a feature request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I submitted the feature request. I really think this would open up the doors for creative installers... I checked the MUI Readme for MUI_LARGER_UI and I couldn't find it. I am guessing this doesn't exist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 21:22</div></div><div class="posttext">MUI_LARGER_UI doesn't exist. What I was trying to say is there is no technical barrier stopping the MUI from providing an option to select between a set of sizes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">But I advise you not to deviate from the Microsoft Wizard 97 User Interface Guidelines (http://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/wizard/sdkwizv4_5ttf.asp?frame=true). A too large installer window looks unfriendly to a general computer user, and may scare people away. Please keep it the way it is. If you want big, large install windows you better bring up a new window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 08:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello saivert,<br />
<br />
Having options is always better than being left without a choice. I wasn't asking that the main MUI be changed in size by default. I was asking an option be made available for those of us who wish to create bigger size installers.<br />
<br />
If the option was made available it wouldn't and shouldn't affect anyone's project unless they explicitly choose to define a greater size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 08:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but I don't like any installer whose windows are greater than what they are now. I don't say I endorse whatever M$ is saying, but their User Interface Guidelines are actually pretty useful, and most of it looks OK. I have found myself jammed in a corner when designing my UI, and after a couple of reads on MSDN regarding UI guidelines, I have come up with a nice UI for my app.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">If the option was made available, which option would you choose? Isn't life grand when you have an option ;)<br />
<br />
Trust me, it'll make us both happy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 08:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I know, but let's not hijack this topic for our own conversation. Take it to PM....</div></div><hr />
