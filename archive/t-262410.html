<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daniel McGravey</div><div class="date">24th December 2006, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">My software is coded in Visual Basic and contains Macromedia Flash.  When end-user runs my NSIS installer, the installer should detect Flash and to a) upgrade their Flash or b) install the latest Flash<br />
<br />
I have found pages:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Special:Search?search=flash<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Get_Macromedia_Flash_version<br />
<br />
However, they seem like they are placed in your main application and NOT your NSIS file (*.nsi).  <br />
<br />
In a nutshell, what do I need to do to integrate the ability for my NSIS installation to determine if my user is or is not running latest version of Flash and to install Flash so that users can see my Flash embedded into my Visual Basic application?<br />
<br />
Much appreciated and want to extend happy holidays to you.</div></div><hr />

They are examples that you could modify to suit your needs, or not if it's not necessary, it's up to you, thus you could implement them in your own script.<br />
Also, you may search the forum, for instance, here is a result from a quick search.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daniel McGravey</div><div class="date">25th December 2006, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I put the code into my NSIS script but it shows just shows my current flash OCX version.  Put simply, what code do I need to put in to download the latest version of Flash player if the user's version isn't current.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hannes</div><div class="date">25th December 2006, 04:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably the best option is perhaps to include the installer for the latest version of flash in your own installer.<br />
<br />
You can then check to see if they have a particular version installed that is required, and if not, then execute the flash installer.<br />
<br />
Is the 'latest' version required?  It would be hard to know where to retrieve the latest installer from the internet.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents worth...</div></div><hr />

Also this would detect if flash is installed on the target machine.<br />
Then you should add some code to perform the comparison if the version is current, and if current continue with the installation, if not current, download the last release from adobe server, execute it, and continue with the installation.<br />
Check this plugin http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InetLoad_plug-in for info about downloading.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry just noticed your post a little late but I guess the script attched herewith is what you need.<br />
Feel free to use it as it is or modify as per your requirement.<br />
<br />
edit: Watch out for the exact file path of flash installer on line 52 of the attached code.</div></div><hr />
