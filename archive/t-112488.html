<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Modern UI 1.4 has been released!<br />
<br />
It uses no global variables anymore, even if you are using Install Options! So you can use all variables for your own code.<br />
<br />
Also, the macro's are smaller because of the new page system.<br />
<br />
Basic Macro System<br />
If you were using the Basic Macro System of Modern UI 1.3 final, you only have to make a few small changes in your script:<br />
<br />
* Remove MUI_BASICFUNCTIONS_INIT<br />
* Rename MUI_COMPONENTPAGE to MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE<br />
* Rename MUI_DIRSELECTPAGE to MUI_DIRECTORYPAGE<br />
<br />
Advanced Macro System<br />
The advanced macro system is way easier now. You can add an Install Options page by just adding one Page command and a function, see the Readme for more info.<br />
<br />
If you were using the Advanced Macro System, you'll have to update your script to the new page system. Have a look at InstallOptions.nsi to see all the changes.<br />
<br />
Translation<br />
I have updated all language files to the new 1.4 format. If you want to update your language files, please download the updated files first.<br />
<br />
If you want to contribute a new translation, have a look at &quot;Contrib\Modern UI\Language Files&quot; to see how you can make a Modern UI translation.<br />
<br />
There are also some NLF language files that need to be updated (accelerator keys should be added).</div></div><hr />

I will try to fix it tomorrow.<br />
What you are talking about, Joost, is impossible...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the Modern UI should have a different text on the NSIS page and the Browse for Folder dialog, DirText should have an option to use the text only on the Browse for Folder dialog.<br />
<br />
I will also make some changes to the Advanced Macro System when I have time for it (macro's for the default Page functions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Macro System Update<br />
<br />
I made a lot of updates to the macro system.<br />
<br />
It's now possible to use the basic macro's even if you are using custom pages. I also renames some macro's.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the examples!</div></div><hr />

When you started developing it I didn't expect that it will grow into something this easy and efficient.<br />
<br />
I just downloaded today's version (it's the reason why am I posting this) - with just one macro for both uninstall and install. That constant reducing of number of macros made it excellent.<br />
<br />
You, kichik and the others have done fantatstic job with that NSIS 2.0 development. Congratulations! Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mikem4600</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I think that the new ModernUI is terrific! Great job people!<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I found an error in the ModernUI readme.html while I was converting my scripts to the new macro format.<br />
<br />
At the &quot;Define which elements you are using&quot; part, it says<br />
...!define MUI_UNINSTALL ;Uninstaller<br />
but the instruction that actually works is !define MUI_UNINSTALLER (it's in basic.nsi).<br />
<br />
It took me about an hour trying to figure out what's wrong with my script until I finally got it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">matini</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 05:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the MUI_SYSTEM macro should check MUI_UNINSTALLER defined <br />
or not so it won't produce warnings if I don't define it.<br />
<br />
This is what I do now:<br />
<br />
!macro MUI_SYSTEM<br />
<br />
  !verbose 3<br />
  <br />
  !insertmacro MUI_INTERFACE<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_BASIC<br />
  !ifdef MUI_UNINSTALLER<br />
    !insertmacro MUI_UNBASIC<br />
  !endif<br />
  <br />
  !verbose 4<br />
<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
