<br />
Today I encountered a problem after building makensis and trying to run it. I received this error.<br />
Error: opening stub &quot;...../nsis/Stubs/zlib&quot;<br />
Error initalizing CEXEBuild: error setting default stub<br />
<br />
After looking through google, I learned that someone else had this same problem, although they were able to fix it.<br />
<br />
This is a link to that thread.<br />
<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=242642&amp;highlight=Stubs<br />
<br />
It seemed that everything went fine when the SConstruct was replaced, but that link is dead and my attempts to find it have failed.<br />
<br />
If anyone could help me I'd greatly appreciate it. I apologize if a solution to this problem is in another thread.<br />

(/Stubs/zlib) doesn't exist</div></div><hr />

Building just makensis is not enough, you have to build the stubs as well. If you only need makensis because you're not on Windows, you can use the stubs from a release. Follow the build documentation for more details.<br />
