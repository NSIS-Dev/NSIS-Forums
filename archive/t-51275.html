<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">31st May 2001, 05:49</div></div><div class="posttext">OK guys I put together NSIS v1.43. <br />
It is on http://firehose.net/free/nsis and http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis .<br />
<br />
Changes:<br />
- Cleaned up the way lines ending with \ are concatenated. <br />
- Made $\r and $\n converted before parsing, so that you can use them anywhere (even in header attributes) <br />
- Added GetParent instruction which lets you get the parent directory of a directory. <br />
- Added /ifempty switch to DeleteRegKey <br />
<br />
I'm going to start working on NSIS 1.5 shortly. Features I'm planning on adding:<br />
- support for defining symbols and having &lt;symbol&gt; be replaced in the source file<br />
- support for !undefine<br />
- having a reboot flagging system, and a reboot instruction<br />
- more options for uninstaller (including callbacks and silent mode)<br />
- enumregkey/enumregvalue instructions (maybe).<br />
<br />
I have some other things I've been thinking about, but I'm trying to weigh in which things I will do, and which ones I won't, because I don't want to bloat the exe header. Compiler improvements (like the !define features) will most definately get in, since they really don't cost anything.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have been emailing me with their custom functions for doing things like checking whether or not the current user is the administrator, what version of windows/ie you are running, and what not. At this time none of these seem general enough to add to the installer directly -- you can do pretty much all of this just by looking at (and attempting to write to) the registry. If people want, I will make an official NSIS page with example functions to do these things. Send your contributions to justin@nullsoft.com. :)<br />

P.S. The NSIS page on nullsoft.com will now be no more than 24 hours behind the firehose.net address. Thanks, Tom. :)<br />
P.P.S. Check out http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/ .. Guess what Sun uses to distribute their Java distribution system?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />

<br />
A page with information on how to do all those things is a great idea. You can have all sorts of functions there... for Admin checking, DLL installing, etc.<br />
<br />
There is one 'feature' which should be considered ading as an 'extra' compiler option in NSIS: adding extra installation screens. This makes the installer a lot bigger, but some people really need to get some user input.<br />
Or maybe it should be a seperate app which takes user input and returns an ini file which NSIS can read - hint for someone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yazno</div><div class="date">31st May 2001, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
<br />
i wrote some functions and uploaded them to the 'function archive' on my tripod account (s. Sig). feel free to use them (on the forthcoming official page).<br />
<br />
the features thing:<br />
<br />
koen, justin, maybe it could be done by making patches and apply them to makensis.exe to en-/disable a feature.<br />
<br />
so the standard version could be downloadable on the nsis page and the special features as extrapage etc. are available as separate downloads in patchform, for the guys who don't have a c compiler.<br />
<br />
what do you think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">31st May 2001, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Can NSIS be made to accept more than one<br />
&quot;patch&quot;?  Don't most patchers look for a<br />
specific location in a file, which may change<br />
after the first patch?  Anyhow it would be really<br />
cool if that could work somehow...<br />
<br />
Another way to do it would be a plug-ins<br />
system...how much bloat would that add to the<br />
core .exe?  The compiler-guys could make a<br />
.dll out of their function, input screens,<br />
what-have-you, and provide calling instructions,<br />
and it *could* be scripted in like such<br />
<br />
CALLDLL plugin.dll C_FUNCTION_NAME (PARAMETERS)<br />
<br />
<br />
or however c functions get called.<br />
Then, the .dll would get rolled into the .exe and be extracted JIT.<br />
<br />
Perhaps two versions of MakeNSIS.exe could be distro'd...<br />
one plugged in :)<br />
and one unplugged :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

The problem is that you need a patch for every single combination of options, which, with 6 options at the moment I believe, gives you 6*5*4*3*2=720 combinations with patches.<br />
A plugin system with 2 different versions is handier, I think.</div></div><hr />
