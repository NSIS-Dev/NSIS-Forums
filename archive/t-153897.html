<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myne</div><div class="date">25th October 2003, 05:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a flag that can be set to extract directly from the exe to the hdd?<br />
The minor problem is that the exe is 500mb, the resulting files are 900mb and it needs 900mb again for the temp file. That means it has to have about 1.7gig free to install.<br />
<br />
I did a search and didnt find anything that might help so sorry if its a repeat.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The current method was chosen because seeking back in solid compression is painfully slow. If, for example, a file that is at the middle of the data block is to be extracted after the end has already been reached, seeking all the way back to the start and decompressing everything again is required, unless we saved the extracted data, which is what NSIS does at the moment.</div></div><hr />
