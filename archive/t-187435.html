<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VegetaSan</div><div class="date">22nd July 2004, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">ok .. I was wondering .. if a tooltip like this is possible:<br />
<br />
&lt; LIKE THIS &gt; (http://vesan**********/anime-sacrifice/)<br />
<br />
NOTE: check the dhtml menu at the top of that link<br />
<br />
I know that a plugin is needed for it if it is possible .. but I cant make it .. and Iam not saying that someone needs to make it .. Iam just saying ;) ... that<br />
<br />
if you make shit like this .. then you would kick all the other installer software's assssssesss.. like REALLY HARD !!!!!! ...<br />
<br />
With Regard, Vegeta :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">22nd July 2004, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">what does this have to do with installers? lobo's tooltip plugin is good enough. if nsis had any fancy feature you're thinking of, it'd probably as slow as installshield :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VegetaSan</div><div class="date">22nd July 2004, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">lol .. but still .... it would be great if it had something like that :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D<br />
<br />
and I wasnt saying put a dhtml menu in a installer .. I was saying ... some like that .. I needed an example :)</div></div><hr />

As I said, the fade is only possible in NT OS's.</div></div><hr />

both :/<br />
<br />
Although, msdn offers the delay displaying the tips, maybe that can work.<br />
<br />
But the font, font size, fore and backcolor can work with the new tooltip plugin <br />
<br />
