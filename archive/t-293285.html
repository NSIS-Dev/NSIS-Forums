<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">********</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">On my Win2000 there is a consistent problem with NSIS installers in that they do not accept english chars in destination path dialog.<br />
<br />
At first I thought that it is a feature, because delete, select and copy/paste keys work ok and when you delete a part of a path - a list of suggestions from existing paths appears in a drop-down box. It was a little annoying to create new folders using &quot;Browse...&quot; button dialog, but not impossible. But now I've got a GUI written with NSIS for a console tool and the GUI doesn't allow to enter english text in dialog controls at all. Keys pressed are just ignored. Backspace doesn't work also. If I switch keyboard locale then localized text is correctly entered and displayed, backspace works ok.<br />
<br />
I can't find another program with same symptoms, so the problem must be with NSIS itself. This happens with installers compiled with 2.29 to 2.37 - do not know about older versions.</div></div><hr />

Nothing blocks users from entering anything in that input control. Does it happen with all installers including the installer for the NSIS package itself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">********</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it happen in the address bar of Explorer as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">********</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">No. It is ok both in explorer bar and in run dialog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th June 2008, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">And this one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">********</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 07:06</div></div><div class="posttext">This dialog is also buggy. I've checked with another win2000 - it seems ok there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">That dialog does nothing but call SHAutoComplete. That plus the fact it happens only on one specific computer makes me want to pull the &quot;not me&quot; card. Have you tried re-registering shlwapi.dll? That move has magical abilities to fix stuff on Windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">********</div><div class="date">23rd June 2008, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the hint! It was a wrong version of shlwapi.dll from WinXP that slipped into my installation. After replacing the wrong version everything works ok now.</div></div><hr />
