<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fitzroy_doll</div><div class="date">14th October 2009, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Attached is a barebones version of an installer I am working on. There are some elements to clean up, and much left to do (many of the language functions for example have not yet been done), but I wanted to see if anyone would be able to take a look at it and let me know if they spot any problems.<br />
<br />
The goal of the installer is to do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Function on 32 or 64 bit windows xp, vista and 7. <br />
<br />
2. Get the initial install path from the registry, but allow the user to supply their own path if it fails. <br />
<br />
3. Extrapolate the second install path from the first based on the known pattern of the installed files, but allow the user to supply their own path if this process fails.<br />
<br />
4. Test whether files or folders are present in each path and warn the user if not.<br />
<br />
The installer will do other things that require keeping the first and second install paths seperate. I have based this on Afrow UK's Steam account finder and his two installs in one installer ( two installations in one installer (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Two_installations_in_one_installer) ), but with some modification to both. <br />
<br />
The two installations script in particular has been changed to remove the components page. However, I have had to leave in place a great deal of the code which supported optional components in order to keep the two sectionsgroups seperate. Please advise if this can be cleaned up more effectively. The script will compile as-is, but you will need to create some empty folders in order to see some of the functions in action.<br />
<br />
My only question is: <br />
<br />
Is this going to work? Is there anything in here that won't work or isn't needed? Anything that is needed that isn't here?<br />
<br />
Many thanks - any input would be very welcome.</div></div><hr />

Since you're the one who knows what it should be doing, that should be a whole lot quicker than asking random others to verify your installer code for you.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd be rather surprised if there were anyone who'd feel like digging into your installer from scratch and work their way all through your code... Try asking specific questions, something people can solve. &gt;__&lt;</div></div><hr />
