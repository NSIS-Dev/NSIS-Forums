<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalverson</div><div class="date">15th February 2008, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I added a mutex to our installs.  It would appear that the UAC plugin can not spawn another process because of the mutex being the same; i.e. - an instance of the install is already running message.  This is just a FYI note.  I suspect I could do something to fix that if we decide to use the plugin. Right now, I am just looking for a way to do any update install as a limited account user after the product has already been installed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalverson</div><div class="date">18th February 2008, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">As it turns out.  I can use the Access Control plug-in to get the read write access to the installed files.  This will allow me to make the install product directory read write accessible by all users.  I tested this and it worked great.  The limited account user is able to do an update install just fine.</div></div><hr />
