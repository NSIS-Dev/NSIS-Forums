<br />
For weeks  I tried to add a cancel button to stop the installation process, ie enable cancel button while you are copying the files to the hard disk.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance.:up:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zinthose</div><div class="date">29th March 2010, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue is that NSIS is not a transactional installation system like MSI, thus what do you plan to do about the previously completed installation operations?<br />
<br />
I performed a search on the forums, which I'm sure you already did... right?, and found several threads on the topic.  None of which that seam to conclude in a working solution.<br />
<br />
Unless you use a custom extraction plug-in or external utility, I don't see an easy solution without recompiling NSIS for your own needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wilfredor</div><div class="date">3rd April 2010, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan to delete the installation process if you click cancel. Uninstall the average installation. If the solution is a plugin, what I recommend?<br />
<br />
It is very important for me to cancel the installation process, I'm installing a very large software and the person might regret in the middle of the process.<br />
<br />
Thanks :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">6th April 2010, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">This question seems to pop up with some regularity.  I can't really -recommend- trying to get around this, but it is possible.  There's some old thread where I posted an example using the NSIS classic UI that I was going to point to - but then I saw somebody mentioned they couldn't get it to go with Modern UI 2.<br />
<br />
So I gave it a reworking and decided to write up an NSIS WiKi page that contains the example and the steps taken to get from a skeleton installer to the end result, and why those steps were/had to be taken.  That way everybody can add enhancements / correct problems / etc.<br />
<br />
You can find it at the (hopefully quite logical) topic:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InstFiles_Cancel_-_Allowing_a_user_to_cancel_installation_during_InstFiles<br />
( InstFiles Cancel - Allowing a user to cancel installation during InstFiles )<br />
<br />
Be warned - it's a pretty long topic, and even the end-result code may look daunting.  As Zinthose mentioned.. you weren't meant to do this with NSIS.  On the other hand, the fact that you -can- is testament to its flexibility? :D<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
