<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qwertymodo</div><div class="date">8th April 2009, 06:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to replace a string inside of a text file at compile time, in the same way that the ReplaceInFile header does.  I know that I COULD write a separate script that does it via the command-line, then call<br />
<br />
<br />
!system '&quot;${NSISDIR}\makensis.exe&quot; &quot;textreplacescript.nsi&quot;' = 0<br />
!system '&quot;textreplace.exe&quot; &quot;commandlineargs&quot;' = 0<br />
!delfile &quot;textreplace.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there an easier way?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I was too quick...<br />
This will not work at compile time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qwertymodo</div><div class="date">9th April 2009, 02:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... well in the mean time I'll try the other way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qwertymodo</div><div class="date">12th April 2009, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">So, the whole point of this question was that I have portable-ized a few programs for the U3 platform, and anyone who has ever perused PortableApps.com knows how useful NSIS is for creating portable application launchers.  Unfortunately, I did have to go the route I had indicated, but it ended up not being so bad.  I actually added a few more functions in this manner as well.  My one gripe was having to use separate helper scripts, which just made the source folder all ugly.<br />
<br />
Then I discovered the wonders of !system 'echo ... &gt;&gt; mytempfile'<br />
<br />
Well, one thing led to another, and it was just too cool using runtime commands at compile time, and then I was like &quot;hey I'll bet I could take all of these helper scripts I'm writing and merge them all into one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, I did actually managed to write a very useful script whose output file does NOTHING.<br />
<br />
...I get the feeling that no one else has done this before...<br />
<br />
...perhaps with good reason...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...I scare myself sometimes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">12th April 2009, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this.<br />
<br />
!define /file BUNCHASTUFF somefile.txt<br />
<br />
!searchreplace NEWSTUFF &quot;${BUNCHASTUFF}&quot; &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;<br />
...<br />
<br />
!delfile somefile.txt<br />
!appendfile somefile.txt &quot;${NEWSTUFF}&quot;<br />
<br />
Also you could use the NSIS !echo command instead of using !system command to call echo in your script.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">12th April 2009, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I just realized that code probably won't work with script files or with any other files that breaks the parameter quoting. :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qwertymodo</div><div class="date">14th April 2009, 06:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I'll have to try that.  Can !echo be used with &gt;&gt; the same as the system echo can?  I mean, what is the actual difference?  And as for breaking parameter quoting, I can usually get around that with $\&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th May 2009, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no !echo, only !appendfile and it works on all platforms and doesn't depend on the existence of echo or platform dependent command line parsing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qwertymodo</div><div class="date">10th May 2009, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there is an !echo command, I guess it just outputs only to the compiler, but thanks for pointing me at !appendfile, it's exactly what I needed.<br />
<br />
...also, I'm not sure what you mean by platform-independent, as I'm pretty sure NSIS is Windows only anyways...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">11th May 2009, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS can build on other platforms other than Windows (but only build installers that run on Windows).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qwertymodo</div><div class="date">11th May 2009, 04:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, right, I knew that... just for some reason I wasn't thinking about the fact that it's a compile-time command, which would depend on the compiling system :P  Anyway, problem solved, so thanks for the input :)</div></div><hr />
