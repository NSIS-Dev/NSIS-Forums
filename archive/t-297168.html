<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zanz</div><div class="date">10th September 2008, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Using InstallLib, I'm trying to register a few DLLs on a x64 system. But the DLLs do not get registered. However, instead of InstallLib, if I use RegDLL, the dlls register fine. Also, the same syntex works fine on a 32 bit system.<br />
<br />
Here's how I setup my script:<br />
1) !define LIBRARY_X64 is defined at the beginning of the script.<br />
2) SetRegView 64 is also set.<br />
3) !insertmacro InstallLib REGDLL SHARED REBOOT_NOTPROTECTED &quot;${SOURCE_DIR}\my.dll&quot; &quot;$COMMONFILES64\myDLLFolder\my.dll&quot; $COMMONFILES64  is the syntex to register the DLL (it works fine on a 32 bit system, just doesn't work on 64 bit system).<br />
<br />
<br />
It'll be a great help if someone can point out what am I missing here? Why it's not working on 64 bit system? Since it's a shared DLL, my concern is that it might be in use when the installer is updating the DLL, and might throw an error. Therefore, InstallLib is the solution I need, but I can't get it to work. Please help!</div></div><hr />

How does RegDLL work if it's a x64 DLL? The installer is always 32-bit and can therefore never load x64 DLL. You're probably using a 32-bit DLL and should therefore not define LIBRARY_X64.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zanz</div><div class="date">10th September 2008, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply kichik. I have been trying a lot things to make this work.<br />
It doesn't make any difference if I define LIBRARY_X64 or not. InstallLib cannot register the DLL. I've tested it both ways. The DLL i have is compatible with both 32 and 64 bit systems, but needs to be installed and registered at Common Files path. <br />
Any other hints?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zanz</div><div class="date">10th September 2008, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I can also register the DLL successfully by calling,  ExecWait '&quot;$SYSDIR\regsvr32.exe&quot; /s &quot;DLL_Path\MyDll.dll&quot;'<br />
<br />
It's just that InstallLib REGDLL isn't working :-(</div></div><hr />
