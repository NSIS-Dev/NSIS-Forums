<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnChen</div><div class="date">7th June 2011, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't find any resources regarding how to use instfiles in user's manual. Could any guru here explain it a little bit? I meant the syntax to use it and the meanings of each parameter. Also if I want to quit from instfiles page, how can I do that? It looks like there is a build-in page associated with instfiles page. If I don't want to show this page, how can I avoid it? Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

You can't &quot;run&quot; the instfiles page without showing the page.  Aborting installation is difficult, but if you search the forums there's a lot of threads about it. If you want to install stuff without showing the instfiles page, I suppose you could do everything in the leave function of your own custom page... But there's probably a better way to create your own instfiles equivalent. No idea myself.</div></div><hr />

Basically my question is that how can I replace the exsiting instfiles page with my custom page? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

It does several things 'behind the scenes' that would be more work to do on your custom page: it executes the sections that are selected, it changes the Next button to Install on the page before InstallFiles, it blocks going Back when InstallFiles is complete.</div></div><hr />

It is not that install page won't work for me. It is because for some circumstance, I want to quit the installation, so the layout, text, etc from the original install page are not appropriate any more.</div></div><hr />
