I was wondering if anyone other than me needs to split the installer file in small parts so that they can be copied to some floppy disks.<br />
I know, I know.... still using floppy disks? Well, yes, for some application I'm still using the old floppy and could be really nice to use the NSIS also with the floppy disk.<br />
Any idea to implement soch an option?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spanky</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Most compression utilities support disk spanning.  For easier distribution create a self-extracting archive.<br />
<br />
From there you can have the archive run your installer, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVD</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right, but, in that way, you need first to extract the NSIS<br />
executable and then run it. Therefore the installation process will be much slower. It could be much better if the NSIS engine could work directly from the splitted files.<br />

<br />
you could use an additional offset for EW_EXTRACTFILE specifying a file number that could be base_01, base_02 etc..<br />
<br />
Then you would need to modify GetCompressedDataFromDataBlock so that it can optionally take a third parameter (use  &quot;, ... )&quot; ) that specifies an alternative input file which would be on the other floppy disk. If the file base_%u did not exist on the floppy, the installer would need to ask for another disk. To save problems of the installer needing to read from the initial .exe, have it copy itself to a temporary directory first.<br />
<br />
With regard to makensis, you would need to make it generate the install file's section in different files after the installer size exceeds 1.38 mb and I haven;t thought about how to do that, yet.</div></div><hr />

Point well made.  I forgot the actual speed of floppy drives but it's somewhere around 300KB/sec.</div></div><hr />
