Did you read my question?<br />
I want to run my Exe for all users.Currently it was run only admin users.<br />
This is how UAC works. For all users, install into $programfiles, HKLM and use setshellvarcontext all with requestexecutionlevel admin... <br />
Based on Anders suggestion I have tried following code changes in my script.<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
setshallvarcontext all<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
requestexecutionlevel admin<br />
<br />
but its not working for normal users.Again admin users only able to run the app.<br />
<br />
How to run my app for all users?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">28th August 2013, 07:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I read all of it. My question is: What exactly do you mean with &quot;run your exe for all users&quot;? I can interpret that in at least four different ways.<br />
<br />
Do you mean you want Windows to run your exe each time any user logs on? Or maybe once, next time the users log on?<br />
<br />
Or do you mean your exe needs specific access rights (such as writing access), regardless of which user runs the app? Or do you simply want to install your app for each user so it shows up in each user's start menu folder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ilaiyaraja</div><div class="date">28th August 2013, 08:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Msg.<br />
I think your fourth point is correct.<br />
do you simply want to install your app for each user so it shows up in each user's start menu folder? <br />
<br />
Currently my exe run only for, who are all have admin privilege those users only can able to do.<br />
If the normal users[Non-admin users] run asking permission for admin privilege.<br />
I want to remove this restriction.<br />
Simply, who all are login into the system those users want to run my app.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">28th August 2013, 12:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to install to alluser shellvar context, and stop your application from trying to write to admin-only locations.<br />
<br />
1. In the installer, use requestexecutionlevel admin.<br />
2. In the installer, use setshellvarcontext all.<br />
3. In your application, request executionlevel user.<br />
4. In your application, write all user settings and user data to application data or alluser application data.</div></div><hr />
