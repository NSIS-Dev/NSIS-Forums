<br />
I've made a SetupCD but my Problem is, that the Files musn't be writeprotected after the installation, after copying from a CD (which is always write protected) I want to change this value of the Files properties<br />
<br />
but I don't know how<br />
<br />
I've already searched the Helpfile, but I couldn't find something about this Topic<br />
<br />
I hope anyone knows what to do<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flizebogen</div><div class="date">16th April 2004, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">SetFileAttributes is the command you are looking for.<br />
<br />
If you use the parameter NORMAL than the read-only status is removed. But unfortunately this command doesn't supports wildcards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">16th April 2004, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll specify my problem:<br />
<br />
I copy the Files of my Setup with CopyFiles because the Files are changed often and I don't want to recompile the Setup every few days. Because I have the Files on the Setup CD they are write-protected (don't know if this is the right word), but the Installer has to write a few lines in a file which is copied at the beginning.<br />
<br />
So I need a Info how to change the write-protection-property to false<br />
<br />
any Ideas?<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
oh thats what we call timing<br />
<br />
whats a wildcard? :igor:</div></div><hr />

any Ideas?You can't do that, and probably $CDBURN_AREA can be used to store files to write at one time after in a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R or DVD-RW.<br />
<br />
whats a wildcard?* - A mask for all names with any characters long.<br />
? - A mask for all names with 1 character long. (more ?'s, more characters...).<br />
<br />
*.* - Means all folders and files.<br />
*. - Means all folders or files with no extention at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davion</div><div class="date">16th April 2004, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the info about the word Wildcard I never heard that word before<br />
<br />
and about the read only mode - I don't wan't to use the properties of the files on the CD, I copy the files to the Instdir and change the properties then<br />
<br />
thanks for your advices</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flizebogen</div><div class="date">16th April 2004, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">CopyFiles $EXEDIR\Test.file $INSTDIR<br />
<br />
copies the file to the $INSTDIR<br />
<br />
SetFileAttributes $INSTDIR\test.file NORMAL<br />
<br />
this removes the READONLY Status<br />
<br />
This Way the Test.file is copied to $INSTDIR and isn't read-only anymore<br />
<br />
But as i've written previously you have to use the command SetFileAttributes for every fiel you want to copy (No Wildcard Support)</div></div><hr />
