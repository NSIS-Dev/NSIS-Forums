<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone found a good way to deal with the ` character that is legitamtely contained in some double-byte ansi text for asian languages?<br />
<br />
It seems problematic, because a lot of the String/Word macros use <br />
Push `${STRING}`<br />
This will cause an error, and using ' works, but that can cause an error if you have English text that contains an apostraphe.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's used in your local language, it shouldn't be a problem because it'll be skipped. If it's not, it's usually in a LangString containing translations for a specific string. If you push the LangString, there should be no problem with quoting because the parser only sees the LangString. Where did bump into this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not currenlty using LangString--I'm using !defines and referencing those values in my script. I ran into the problem trying to pass a Chinese string through StrNSISToIO (in StrFunc.nsh), which uses ` to Push and Pop like most header macros do.<br />
<br />
I'll look into using LangString and see if that gets around the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're using switches everywhere to get the right language for every string or is it single-language script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I'm using separate language files and then just including the one I need to at build time (build is language-specific).  I know NSIS is geared towards creating generic builds that can change language at runtime, but I've had no problems with my old-fashioned approach until this problem arose, which I can get around but was looking for the most efficient way to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about defining something for double-bytes at build time and modifying some string macros to alter the Push syntax based on that define, but I think it's simpler and safer to use LangString for those rare cases where a string contains ` , and then reference the LangString in my script instead of the language file define.<br />
<br />
Thanks Kichik!</div></div><hr />
