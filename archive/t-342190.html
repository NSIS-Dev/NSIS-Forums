<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zizzzzy</div><div class="date">14th February 2012, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an installer I had created last year that I just went to go update and test on Windows 7, and seem to only have run into one snag.  The installer wraps another installer, so that I could effectively install our Email software with our settings already configured.<br />
<br />
Part of the script needs to copy a repair utility I have create to the programs folder inside $PROGRAMFILES.  While I have a check &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot; and a check to make sure the program can not be run as regular user, my CopyFiles is unable to dump the file to this location, error returned is 0<br />
<br />
I suspect that it is the Windows security setting that prompts even admin users, for the 'OK'  to dump files in Windows protected folders.  The wrapped installer program installs fine with no issues writing to the folder, its the single file copy after that is giving me trouble.<br />
<br />
How do I get around this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Or append repair.exe to the destination path too.<br />

<br />
After my initial script, I made a template from it to search and replace for quick version updates. When I did so I missed including repair.exe in the folder to be packaged.  Sadly it was not running because it was not there to run.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time</div></div><hr />
