<br />
Anyone has any idea why its not working? (I see the text as-is, &amp; not in 3 lines)<br />

The code:<br />
<br />
	FileOpen $1 &quot;$INSTDIR\uninstall-warning.txt&quot; r ; open file<br />
	FileRead $1 $2 ; we read until the end of line (including carriage return and new line) and save it to $1<br />
	FileClose $1 ; and close the file	<br />
	StrCmp $2 &quot;&quot; +3 0 ; jump +3 if equal (jump 0 if not equal) <br />
	MessageBox MB_YESNO $2 IDYES continue<br />
	Quit<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">25th January 2012, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You're expecting something to replace the three character newline ( $\n ) with a single ANSI newline. Neither FileRead nor MessageBox will do that for you. You can do it with WordReplace though.!include &quot;WordFunc.nsh&quot;<br />
... open and read the file<br />
StrCpy $R0 $<br />
StrCpy $R0 &quot;$R0\n&quot;<br />
${WordReplace} $2 $R0 $\n + $2<br />
... then call MessageBox <br />
The StrCpy statements are needed to generate the newline search term as three characters instead of a single character. (The WordReplace won't find the single character newline, but it will find the three character newline).</div></div><hr />

Afrow UK,<br />
I checked your idea:<br />
<br />
I.e. File Content:<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT WARNING!\nBy uninstalling you may be contravening your employer's Acceptable Use Policy.\nPlease consider carefully whether you have the appropriate authority to take this action.\n<br />
<br />
Does not work for me.<br />
<br />

<br />
I wonder,<br />
Is it possible representing multiline-text in the file itself, eliminating the need of WordReplace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">26th January 2012, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you understand. $\n and \n are just ASCII representations of new-lines in NSIS and C respectively which are translated to real new-line characters at compile time. If you want to read new-lines from the text file then actually insert new-line characters (i.e. press the enter key!) You'll then have to read all the lines in a loop and concatenate them in a variable.<br />

<br />
I tried to avoid &quot;read all the lines in a loop and concatenate them in a variable&quot;- I looked for something like readng the whole file (until EOF) into a buffer (&lt; 1024 size) &amp; use the buffer as a null-terminated string (that includes already real CRLFs).</div></div><hr />
