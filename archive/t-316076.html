<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">7th January 2010, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. I have not noticed any problem with the UAC plugin when installing/running my 32-bit application on Windows 7 64-bit version (both RC and retail)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">_P_</div><div class="date">9th January 2010, 05:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. I had a user report that upon first install on Win7 64-bit, my app didn't run properly... Windows said there was a version with one of the libraries. After reinstalling, it worked.<br />
<br />
Have yet to hear back from them to pinpoint the issue, but I had a hunch that perhaps the first time they ran my app, they did it by selecting &quot;Run App&quot; from the installer (which calls the UAC plugin), and the second time, they manually executed the app by clicking the icon. But I haven't been able to verify that, and you say everything works, so...<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me know. :)</div></div><hr />
