It seems that UAC.nsh plugin is the current favorite?  Is it the current recommended method?<br />
<br />
If UAC.nsh is the best way currently, then I have some additional questions:<br />
Does anyone have any examples of using UAC and MUI2 together?  Is it still necessary to use MultiUser.nsh when using UAC?<br />
<br />
Thanks folks!<br />
<br />

<br />
My problem is that... I am not using the UAC plugin (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in) but I still don't see any problem with my installer on Vista?<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong? :)<br />
<br />
My installer places executables under C:\Program Files, places shortcuts on the start menu to ALL users, creates a shell context menu, writes to HKLM... - all of that when installing from either admin or &quot;standard user&quot; (limited) - with exactly the same result: shortcuts &amp; context menu are available to all users. This is exactly the behavior I expect and want.<br />
<br />
So what am I doing wrong? :)<br />
<br />
I mean, the UAC plugin (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in) must have been created to solve a Vista problem. But I don't understand which problem.<br />
<br />
Can you please explain?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two ways to install on NT systems:<br />
<br />
a) All users install (SetShellVarContext all/Programfiles/HKLM/Common Startmenu)<br />
<br />
b) Single user (SetShellVarContext current/Application Data/HKCU/Startmenu)<br />
<br />
The UAC plugin will allow you to do both in a ugly hacked way for people that insist on installing things like its Win95. It also solves the problem of running a program on the finish page (UAC plugin can start programs as current user and not the admin doing the install for elevated installers)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Anders, thanks for your explanation. It definitely helped me better understand the need for the UAC plugin, although I currently don't need since I utilize only the first way that you mentioned:Originally posted by Anders <br />
a) All users install (SetShellVarContext all/Programfiles/HKLM/Common Startmenu)<br />
I am now curious about your comment about &quot;ugly hacked way&quot;.  Why is the UAC plugin approach considered &quot;ugly&quot;?</div></div><hr />
