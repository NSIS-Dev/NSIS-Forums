I was bored one day and decided to create an autorun.inf generator.  FULL SOURCE INCLUDED!<br />
<br />
I tried accounting for as many options as I could.  Even the action= section.  However it has been commented out.<br />
<br />
What can this be used for?<br />
Autorun.inf is traditionally in the root of a CD or DVD.  But since Windows XP SP2 and later they can now be used for removable mass storage devices (i.e. flash drives or external harddrives).<br />
<br />
So this can also be placed in the root of your flash drive (and hide it).  By doing this you can give your flash drive your own custom little icon.<br />
<br />
This leaves less thinking and research for you and more thinking to the generator!  Just fill in the form and click generate!<br />
<br />
Hope the community likes it.  Post an opinion if you wish, feed back is always nice.  And if you edited the code and have your own version then post that also!<br />
