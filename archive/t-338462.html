<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkuuselo</div><div class="date">29th November 2011, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I´m currently working with a project where we need to have one installer that does all the this:<br />
<br />
- Install Qt (you can just place the files in the right location)<br />
- Install the database: postgreSQL and then recover the chart database from a backup<br />
- Install GIT and maybe a good GUI tool if you know one<br />
- Install SSH client (putty will do)<br />
- Fetch the latest version of the code from the server (GIT)<br />
- Install any other library needed by the sources<br />
- Places bookmarks to redmine (with the right server address) into firefox/chrome<br />
<br />
Haven´t got the faintest idea how to do this with NSIS and where to start from. The installer must be easy to maintain and easy to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">29th November 2011, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Get redistributable installers for all those software packages and execute them from your installer.<br />
Use a downloading plugin such as inetc to get stuff from your server<br />
For interfacing with postgreSQL, there may be a plugin, but it probably also comes with a commandline interface?<br />
As for the bookmarks, I think that's been asked before. Not sure, search around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkuuselo</div><div class="date">5th December 2011, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the necessary installers, made a zipfile and started NSIS. But no installer was created: Am I missing something? Attached is the logfile form NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">5th December 2011, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps your installer became larger than 2GB? If that's the case, you'll have to supply the zip files as external files and use an unzip plugin on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkuuselo</div><div class="date">5th December 2011, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I´ll check that.</div></div><hr />
