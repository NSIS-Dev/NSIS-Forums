<br />
**************************************************<br />
TO CUT IT SHORT AFTER WELCOME PAGE I WANT TO SKIP THE DEFAULT CHOOSE COMPONENTS PAGE WHEN THE USER CLICKS THE CHECKMARK OF LICENSE PAGE AND GO TO NEXT PAGE 'CHOOSE INSTALL LOCATION PAGE' AND FROM THERE TO CARRY FORWARD TO FINISH PAGE.<br />
****************************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
I've developed my installer without using any page created by me.<br />
<br />
All the default pages of NSIS goes like this during an installation:<br />
<br />
-welcome page<br />
-license page<br />
-choose components page<br />
-choose install location page<br />
-finish page<br />
<br />
I want to accomplish following jobs:<br />
1. When the user moves to the 2nd page the License page and<br />
clicks the 'I accept' - the check mark at left side, I've to<br />
ask user one Question - whether the user wants to do this act or no? I have to trap this event when the user clicks the check mark.<br />
<br />
2. If the user accepts the License page as stated above, I'll popup the message for that particular act yes/no<br />
<br />
3. If he says 'yes' to my Question, then I want to Skip the default choose components page and straight away go to the next page 'choose install location page'<br />
<br />
4. After the selection of destination folder, it will perform all the activities as usual i.e. calling the particular section.<br />
<br />
Any body listening? Esp. Red Wine my current F1 for NSIS!<br />
With regards,<br />
:) :)</div></div><hr />

As for the weird message on license page (really I can't see why you need to pop up a message asking users to confirm that they have read the license) you may set up this action on license page leave function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swapan Das</div><div class="date">13th January 2007, 04:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Red Wine for your response. My msg is not that what you thought. Actually my authority may ask me to insert certain option when the user selects the checkmark in the license page. Something like 'Create database?' If the user selects 'Yes' then skip component page and move to next page.<br />
<br />
How to perform that license page leave function?<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swapan Das</div><div class="date">13th January 2007, 04:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yes, to skip the component page will be dynamic, i.e. depending upon the user's response to my messagebox question after the user selects 'next' page in the license page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">13th January 2007, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually my authority may ask me to insert certain option when the user selects the checkmark in the license page.I'd suggest set up a custom page right after the license page and ask users for additional tasks that may be performed instead of message box.<br />
Then, depending on users selections, on components page pre function, you may skip the page.</div></div><hr />
