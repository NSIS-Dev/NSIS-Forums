It will not let me enter anything and if I leave it blank it says I must enter it.  Now what?  using ver 2.0.3.  Is there a later version?  I don't see one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th January 2009, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the wizard? Which program are you referring to? This is the forum for NSIS, not a specific NSIS IDE, so you'd have to be a bit more specific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">14th January 2009, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">presuming HMSoft's NISEdit (only one that's at 2.0.3).. you don't enter anything - just check the checkboxes of the languages you wish to support.<br />
  You do have to pick -A- language because it defaults to using MUI, which requires a language to be specified (throws errors if you don't)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronbo</div><div class="date">14th January 2009, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it was the NISEdit ver 2.0.3.  I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and this time the language box was populated and allowed me to make a choice.  The first time I tried it was just an empty box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronbo</div><div class="date">15th January 2009, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is crazy.  I created one setup.exe and it didn't work quite right, so I though I'd do another.  Now I am back to where I was.  There is nothing in the language box so I can't check anything and I can't get any further.</div></div><hr />
