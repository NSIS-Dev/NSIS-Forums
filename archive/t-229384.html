<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peterz71</div><div class="date">26th October 2005, 04:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have an NSI script (modern version) which installs the following on a PocketPC device:<br />
<br />
- .NetCF CAB<br />
- Thirdy party CAB<br />
- My application CAB<br />
<br />
Now the problem is: <br />
<br />
There are two versions of the Third Party CAB - one for PPC2000-2002, and one for all later versions.  I emphasize - the version is NOT processor specific, it's OS specific (I didn't write it so don't ask me why).<br />
<br />
Is there a way, from within an NSI script, to determine the version of PocketPC on the device, so I can deploy the correct CAB?<br />
<br />
If not, then any workarounds, ideas, suggestions?<br />
<br />
Much appreciate any help on this!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
PeterZ</div></div><hr />

Those define the minimum and maximum supported versions of the OS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
It's the INF file used by CabWiz that uses VersionMin/VersionMax parameters, not the INI file for CeAppMgr.exe.  <br />
<br />
Like I mentioned before, the third party component already comes in a CAB file - I'm not compiling it, therefore I have no control over the creation of the CAB itself.<br />
<br />
I was hoping to explicitly deploy the appropriate CAB from the NIS script by examening the OS version.  But seems that cannot be done.<br />
<br />
Actually I might take up the issue with the makers of the third party compnent and see if they can produce a CAB file that has the VersionMin parameter set.  That way all I have to do is pass an INI file to CeAppMgr that lists both CABs, and CeAppMgr should pick up the right one?  Is my thinking correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
