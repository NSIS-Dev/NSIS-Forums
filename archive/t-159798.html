<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">15th December 2003, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to make the installer to stop until a specified window is shown and/or closed?  I'm trying to make an installer which also installs several other supporting programs, but one of those install programs launches several 'threads' so thaat execwait does not actually wait.  So I was wondering if there was a way to make the installer set a hook or something and wait until a window with a specified caption was launched?<br />

That would effectively pause the installer.  The disadvantage is that they could continue the installer w/o the other one finishing.<br />

Then you can use IsWindow in a loop to know when it's destroyed. Just make sure you check you haven't missed the window. If you miss it, you can get into an infinite loop. For example:<br />
<br />
Your installer executes that program<br />
Program creates a window<br />
Program finishes and destroys the window<br />
Your loop starts<br />
... Your loop never ends</div></div><hr />
