<br />
I try to install a Windows service and want it to use a specific account to run the service. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately it is installed using the local system account, no matter what I use as userid/password in the call:<br />
<br />
<br />
nsSCM::Install &quot;NTP&quot; &quot;Network Time Protocol Daemon&quot; 16 2 \<br />
  &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\ntpd.exe $BIGSTEP-c $\&quot;$CONFIG_FILE$\&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; \<br />
  &quot;Tcpip&quot; $SERVICE_UID $SERVICE_PWD<br />
<br />
<br />
I use a MessageBox to be sure that $SERVICE_UID and $SERVICE_PWD contain the correct values. <br />
<br />
Anything I miss here?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Heiko</div></div><hr />

<br />
I looked into the sources of nsSCM and found out that the author did not implement creating a service with a username/password. <br />
<br />
I added the parameter handling and things are working fine, now. <br />
<br />
If anyone is interested in getting the fixed version, please let me know. Maybe the author? I'll try to contact him/her...<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Heiko</div></div><hr />

Last post by you was almost a year ago.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Yes, I uploaded a new version of the nsscm and it includes the feature to install a service using a given userid and password.<br />
<br />
So, should work now. Any problems?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Heiko</div></div><hr />
