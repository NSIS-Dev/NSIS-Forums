<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AaronLS</div><div class="date">23rd April 2008, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to show the install details during silent installs.  I could use my own command line parameter and just check for it, but then all my message boxes would have to be wrapped in ${If}-${Else} to check for my custom status.<br />
<br />
I want to do this so my users don't try to run the app during the install, know when it's done, and also there are some third party exe's that display a progress bar in their own window.  I just don't want the user to have any ability to cancel or change the components if an admin runs it remotely as a silent install.</div></div><hr />

If you want, the best you can get is to use only the instfiles page and therefore not giving the user any choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AaronLS</div><div class="date">23rd April 2008, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  That is what I've kind of tested out.  I was thinking I could tell my administrators some custom command line switch they could use, and check for that in the prepage functions and hide all but instfiles.  Hiding the message boxes were really the only problem with that, so I will just write some macros to wrap around my message boxes that will handle that.</div></div><hr />
