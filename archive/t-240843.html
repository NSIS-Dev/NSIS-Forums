<br />
I just bought IconWorkshop to do icons, they have a really nice looking installer. It looks like it could be NSIS but I cant tell. Is it possible to have a background image instead of a color on the MUI pages?<br />
<br />
I've attached a screen shot for refernce. I hope its not InstallShield!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th March 2006, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The trial version installer doesn't use NSIS, so I guess the full version doesn't either. You can make sure by searching the file for NullsoftInst.<br />
<br />
It's possible to have such a background picture, but it'll require some work. You can edit the INI file used to show the welcome page in the pre callback function. In there you can add an image control. Then, in the show callback function you can set the background of all the text controls to transparent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th March 2006, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">No, built-in pages aren't custom and don't use InstallOptions which uses INI files. To add an image to built-in pages, you'd have to edit the UI file (Contrib\UIs\modern.exe) and add image place holders to it, use the new one with MUI_UI and then set the image manually using the System plug-in. An example is available on the wiki (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ModernUI_Mod_to_Display_Images_while_installing_files).</div></div><hr />

You could use ExperinceUI for Nsis to get a somewhat similar looking installer.</div></div><hr />

it contains multiple languages and is based on microsoft cab architecture<br />
but i can not say which software they use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">16th March 2006, 01:50</div></div><div class="posttext">the fact that it uses CAB's doesnt really narrow it down, it contains a section named AXZB (doesnt proove much) also looking at the dialogs in resource hacker you can see that some strings are auto replaced with some value, eg {AppName}, but the string &quot;Thank you for choosing Axialis Software!&quot; is hard-coded which leads me to believe its in-house, I guess you could just send a mail and ask if you really need to know</div></div><hr />
