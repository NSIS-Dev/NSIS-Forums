<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NEHOG</div><div class="date">29th April 2008, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the following (two paragraph) message box in my installer. Under XP the message box looks like I expect. Only my line breaks are in the message box, and the box is the width that I expected it to be. <br />
<br />
Under Vista, however, NSIS seems to be inserting additional line breaks (one before 'Support@mycompan.com' and another before 'worry'.) This makes the message box really ugly under Vista (looks great under XP). We do not want to eliminate our line breaks, as that creates a message box under XP that is incredibly long and difficult to read. <br />
<br />
Anyone know why this is happening? (Please, no comments on size of the box, contents or desired layout--it is what my customer wants--changing the layout would require a very convincing argument as to why it won't work the way he wants it.) <br />

MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_OK &quot;Important: If you have a firewall it may alert you that$\&quot;MyApplication.exe$\&quot;$\r$\n is attempting to access the Internet.

The result should be (and are on XP):<br />

<br />
Leave it to MSFT to break all existing applications that had formatted message boxes! <br />
<br />
We worked hard to get our message boxes with line breaks and formatting that looked good. One quick slash of the programmer's 'pen' at MSFT managed to make many of them look like crud. Did I mention I hate Vista?</div></div><hr />
