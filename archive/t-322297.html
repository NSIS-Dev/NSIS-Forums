<br />
I'm Trying now for several hours but i can't get the Logging to work properly.<br />
What i want to do is to Save the Content of the Details window into a file.<br />
<br />
What i did so far was:<br />
 - a whole lot of googleing and searching this forum<br />
 - getting a logging activated version of NSIS<br />
 - Figuring out that in order to user Logging i have to set &quot;LogSet on&quot; in the beginning of each section.<br />
<br />
So. Know i have a ridiculously large log which contains the DetailPrint entries but not the other DetailsWindow data, along with other unnecessary data.  <br />
<br />
Logging has to work for the Silent installation too.<br />
<br />
Since no clear answer to this Problem exists, i hope to find one here.<br />
Is it even Possible to dumb the DetailsWindow-Content to a File in a Way which works in a Silent installation too?<br />
If yes: Do i do it with LogSet?<br />
<br />
I've checked all the Plugins but they don't seem to solve my Problem. Maybe i just misunderstand their description...<br />
<br />
I hope you guys can Help me or point me at least to the right Direction.<br />
<br />
Regards, <br />

<br />
See the NSIS help file, Appendix &quot;D.4 Dump Content of Log Window to File&quot;.<br />
<br />
Via google search terms: nsis details window log<br />
1st result:<br />
Useful Information - NSIS Wiki<br />
D.4 Dump Content of Log Window to File. This function will dump the log of the installer (installer details) to a file of your choice. ...<br />
nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixD.html - Cached - Similar<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, I just noticed you want it to work in Silent installations as well.  No-can-do on that front.<br />
You'd have to write a macro that performs both DetailPrint and a file-write to a log file.  But that won't automatically capture the automated entries for e.g. File operations.. so you'd have to write a macro for those, too.<br />
The alternative is to take the log file you've got now, read it line-by-line, and write out the lines you're interested in to your actual log file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New Command<br />
DetailToLog [&lt;FileName&gt;|Enable|Disable]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">10th September 2010, 06:00</div></div><div class="posttext">well, technically, the logging build already logs just about everything.. the 'problem' is that it outputs too much... while a DetailPrint+Log outputs too little.  But it's easier to fix the first (parse the log file) than the latter (technically can't).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stopasking</div><div class="date">10th September 2010, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">So i have my clear answer now. Thank you and it's just too bad it's this complicated.<br />
I guess i will deactivate logging for know...<br />
