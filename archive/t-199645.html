<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgillespie</div><div class="date">19th November 2004, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed a couple of times that after installing my test app on NT4, and selecting reboot, it does not reboot, just appears to exit the install (as if I selected reboot later).  On all the machines I noticed this on, there is a temp file still showing in task manager that prevents the reboot happening (even shutdown from the host operating system does not work, until I end the temp process).<br />
<br />
It does seem a bit intermittant, even when testing on a fresh re-ghost of the same OS setup, on the same hardware.<br />
<br />
Anyone seen this behaviour?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th November 2004, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Rebooting code has changed in 2.02. But it shouldn't cause any troubles like this. The code was simply moved somewhere else. As NSIS itself doesn't run any processes with temporary names (unless it's the uninstaller and you're talking about A~NSISu.exe), I think it's something else your installer runs that is causing this. I don't have any idea as to why NSIS is waiting for it though.<br />
<br />
What is the name of that process? Are you using nsExec? Have you declared .onRebootFailed?</div></div><hr />

Am looking into it further, as I do launch several 3rd party installers silently during install (Jet4, ODBC, MDAC)</div></div><hr />
