<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SneakySly</div><div class="date">4th July 2005, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
small and probably easy question, When going up to Add/Remove Programs from Control Panel, and select my SW for uninstalling it, everything gets uninstalled as expected. However, the program doesn't get removed from the list. It remains there, and when clicking Remove button again, windows figures out it already was removed, and asks the user if he would like it to be removed from the list. Then it gets removed and all is fine. <br />
<br />
:weird: <br />
<br />
It would be nice that the program does get removed from the list once uninstalled. Anyone knows how to make this happen?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SneakySly</div><div class="date">6th July 2005, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it did work, thanks. I added the following in the uninstall section and it cleans up the program from the list as it should.<br />
<br />
  DeleteRegKey ${PRODUCT_UNINST_ROOT_KEY} &quot;${PRODUCT_UNINST_KEY}&quot;<br />
  DeleteRegKey HKLM &quot;${PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY}&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />
