<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tupper</div><div class="date">11th May 2003, 21:33</div></div><div class="posttext">After running the uninstaller, the add/remove program list doesn't update automatically (at least on the one machine I've been testing with so far). From what I've read online, the add/remove list updates right after the uninstall process (spawned by it) exits. From what I've read about NSIS, it copies the uninstaller to a temp directory to simplify deletion of the uninstaller. I'm guessing that a new process is created with the new uninstall.exe image as I've observed that the add/remove program list refreshes right when the uninstall GUI comes up. Questions:<br />
<br />
1. Is there a way  to get the add/remove program list updated after the uninstaller finishes? Is this being planned?<br />
<br />
2. Does anyone have suggestions on how to clearly explain this to the user? I've added a follow-up window (that comes up after pressing &quot;Finish&quot;) that tells the user to close and re-open the add/remove program window if the list doesn't automatically refresh. This seems a bit excessive, but I couldn't squeeze the text in the subtitle area. If the user tries to uninstall the program again, Windows tells the user that an error occurred while trying to uninstall my program... A carefully worded phrase might be of general use. Comments?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">11th May 2003, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know. I think you actually have refresh the registry and not<br />
the add/remove.<br />
As you know, you put a string in the registry so the user<br />
can apply there. So for this, you have to refresh the<br />
registry; so add/remove re-search for the current strings to be<br />
uninstall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tupper</div><div class="date">12th May 2003, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the comments Stu and Lobo Lunar. I now see that I should have been clearer in my post. Clarifications:<br />
<br />
1. I think the initial process (that copies uninstall.exe) terminates just after creating the new process with the new image of uninstall.exe.<br />
<br />
2. I do update the registry when my program is installed and when it is uninstalled.<br />
<br />
During the install:<br />
<br />
  WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot; &quot;UninstallString&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe&quot;<br />
  WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot; &quot;DisplayName&quot; &quot;${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot;<br />
  WriteRegDWORD HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot; &quot;NoModify&quot; 1<br />
  WriteRegDWORD HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot; &quot;NoRepair&quot; 1<br />
<br />
<br />
During the uninstall:<br />
<br />
  DeleteRegKey /ifempty HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This part all seems fine as my program shows up in the list after installing and does not show up in new add/remove program windows after uninstalling. (Just the already-present add/remove program window which I use to initiate the uninstall.)<br />
<br />
I can see the add/remove program list being refreshed just after the uninstaller starts.<br />
<br />
Since starting this post, I've changed ${MUI_PRODUCT} to PSI-${MUI_PRODUCT} in my installer, to reduce collisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th May 2003, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The uninstaller forks another process so you can delete the uninstaller itself. The Add/Remove control panel only updates itself when the first process exits (Windows 9x only). We have yet to find a way to force it to reload.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dRaakje</div><div class="date">5th May 2004, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I just ran into this problem too, and started looking for a solution, when I found this thread.<br />
<br />
I just thought of a possible solution to this problem, although it does have another side effect.<br />
<br />
The first uninstaller could remove the registry settings before forking and exiting. Then when it exits, it will be removed. <br />
<br />
The forked uninstaller can then put them back if the uninstall is cancelled. So that you won't lose the settings.<br />
<br />
Of course, it does give a new problem, because now, if you start the uninstaller from add/remove progams and then cancel it, it will not be in the list anymore and you need to reopen or refresh the list manually.<br />
<br />
But perhaps this behaviour could be set with a flag?<br />

However, when I have add/remove programs open and remove the product by clicking the remove button the list gets refreshed. I noticed one thing you were doing in your code, which you shouldn't do in this case, unless you have removed all the children first (ie: the value pairs or subkeys).<br />
<br />
Change the following:<br />
<br />
DeleteRegKey /ifempty HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot;<br />
<br />
to:<br />
<br />
DeleteRegKey HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot;</div></div><hr />
