<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trahma</div><div class="date">25th January 2006, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been teaching myself NSIS all day today but I cam across a problem I can't see to fix.  Is there a way to include a branding image in the install file but not extract it on install?  Essentially I want to have 1 .exe I can distribute taht will have the file in it.  <br />
<br />
The only method I can think of is to output the file and then delete it when I'm done but I don't want that to show up in the log file.  <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">26th January 2006, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Or extract it to $PLUGINSDIR and have it deleted automatically for you.</div></div><hr />

i always delete my self-extracted files myself, because i experienced that nsis does NOT clear the $PLUGINSDIR itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just extracted it into the TEMP-Directory and deleted it afterwards again. It works perfectly ;)<br />
<br />
Now of course it's very easy to do this - you just have to get this idea :) perhaps a &quot;IncludeBrandingImage&quot; or something can be implemented in future versions, though...</div></div><hr />
