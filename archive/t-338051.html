<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamandrew</div><div class="date">23rd November 2011, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone, just trying to find some support, I recently rebuilt my computer with a new SSD and windows 7 64 bit.<br />
I had some issues installing some programs after the install, such as Tversity 1.9.7<br />
<br />
the error i received was <br />
<br />
&quot;Installer integrity check has failed. Common causes include<br />
incomplete download and damaged media. Contact the<br />
installer's author to obtain a new copy.<br />
<br />
More information at:<br />
http://nsis.sf.net/NSIS_Error&quot;<br />
<br />
I downloaded the install numerous times, reformatted, downloaded the file on another PC etc and it would come up with the error straight away.<br />
<br />
I downloaded 1.9.6 and installed it and it worked fine,<br />
I then found 1 9 7 on my Old Hard drive which i had connected to the PC and installed the software and it worked fine!<br />
<br />
I was just wondering is this a Windows 7 64 bit issue? or an installer issue?<br />
is there some software that i might need to install to get it working? i found some NSIS software installer thing but not sure if it actually done anything. <br />
Its sort of like having an issue when it extracts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://cdn.download.tversity.com/TVersitySetup_1_9_7.exe seems to work for me but it seems like it is on a CDN so maybe the file is corrupted on one of the servers, try downloading through a proxy maybe...</div></div><hr />
