<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrisAster</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using InstallLib quite successfully to copy over DLLs.  I'm using a common directory where multiple installers will update a set of common DLLs.<br />
<br />
It has become necessary (or at the very least desireable) to have the DLLs upgraded by DATE instead of relying purely on VERSION as I have in the past.<br />
<br />
I've done a search of the forums for a way to go about handling this, but I have not found a commonly used way.  Perhaps it's unusual to do this or I'm missing something glaringly obvious.<br />
<br />
Could someone please point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kris</div></div><hr />

If you want to have it check both the version and the date, you'd have to make some changes to the Library macros.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, that's exactly what I wanted to do.  I was hoping that it would be just another option with InstallLib like it is in InstallShield.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll have to roll up my sleeves and dive into the Library macros afterall.<br />
<br />
Are there any plans for adding this in the future or is it still to niche?</div></div><hr />

No, but if you submit a patch, I'll consider including it.</div></div><hr />
