<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cony</div><div class="date">12th November 2002, 05:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I have below questions:<br />
<br />
1. At the beginning of install, such message is popped:<br />
   'verifying installer:XX%', how to translate this string<br />
   to other language?<br />
<br />
2. Could it be change all the texts' font size to 9 point instead<br />
   of 8 point?<br />
<br />
3. During install, we can change the destination directory.<br />
  But the display of the directory is English font, if input other<br />
  language, such as Japanese, it cannot display correctly.<br />
  how to change the font to other language?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any comments to my question.</div></div><hr />

can solve my 2 &amp; 3 questions. Find this on my local documentations<br />
of NSIS instead of the online one. Is online documents very old?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th November 2002, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">The online documents are just arranged differently. A new better version should be uploaded soon, in the mean while every command is under Installer Attributes.<br />
<br />
To change the text in question #1 you will have to change it in source/exehead/lang.h and recompile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If only this way can solve my problem, I prefer to not translate.<br />
Hope NSIS's next version can remove these strings out of lang.h file.<br />
So users can translate them very easily as well as other strings.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
<br />
This is really a wonderful software.</div></div><hr />

No can do... This string is needed before the installer data is verified and decompressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, as far as I understood it, all instructions that where previously under the header 'Installer Attributes' are read by the compiler and then written into the .exe. So an instruction like: LoadingText would be written into the .exe too. Or am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Instruction are not exactly written into the EXE. They're written after the EXE in the NSIS datablock or header for attributes setting commands. The loading text on the other hand is hardcoded into the EXE so if the data block gets corrupted somehow it will still be shown. We can't show a text before we have verified it's not corrupted ;)</div></div><hr />
