<br />
I want to run makensis.exe from a network drive without it being installed on the local machine that is running it.  Can this be done?  The documentation says that it picks up where to pick up plugins etc from environment variables.  Obviously the env variables will not be set on the local maching if it has not been installed on it.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
So when it compiles the installer it will pick up the plugins etc from the network folder even if NSIS is not installed on the local machine and the env variables aren't set?  I am using some extra plugins that I have downloaded off the Internet and I have put them in the plugins directory.  So I would need to copy the NSIS Directory to the network drive and then get the other machines that need to use it to call //server/NSIS/makensis.exe path_to_script?  Cool...</div></div><hr />

That's incorrect. It searches for plug-ins, by default, in the Plugins the directory located under the directory where makensis.exe itself is located.<br />
<br />
Running from network shouldn't be a problem. Just try and see for yourself.</div></div><hr />
