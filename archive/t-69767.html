<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pulp</div><div class="date">25th December 2001, 03:56</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS is a great and quite useful tool, maybe most witnessed by its rising popularity recently more of the stuff i download is using NSIS to install..... which is all great and good, but...<br />
<br />
<br />
most software can be installed just fine manually, and i personally dont like cluttering up my add/remove with countless entries, or sometimes u just wanna take a peak at something before fully installing it.... etc...<br />
<br />
so what i am asking for, is maybe a command line option in compiled NSIS installers to simply extract all files to currunt dir, i do *not* wanna see other peoples scripts or whatever, just an option to extract all files without installing is all i am asking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
there is a third party tool that does that at http://www.incomplete.co.uk/nsis.htm but it only works for NSIS 1.56<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
