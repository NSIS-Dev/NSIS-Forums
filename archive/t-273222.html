<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lore_flo</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I have this problem: in my installation I must  send some user data to a server. I obtain this using the InetLoad /POST method. The http server is realized with a .NET WebServices, and when I have sent to the server the informations, the Server must answer me an Acknoledgement or a negation to forward the installation despite the data I have sent. I think the server sends me its answer with a ASMX page. How can I intercept this return page to extract suddendly my information? Does anybody explain me another manner to receive the answer in this cases? <br />
Many thanks to all for the patience.  Lorenzo.</div></div><hr />

It is therefore up to you to change the output that the server executable produces depending on the outcome of the processing, and to read this downloaded file with FileOpen, FileRead, FileClose.<br />
A single 1/0 or yes/no as output would be sufficient.<br />
