Basically it'd be swankadelic to have a simple &quot;Print&quot; button on the License Agreement page.<br />
<br />
Of course this is more than just adding the button but I think some end-users might find it nice to be able to print the license agreement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcgarrah</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I simply install a text/RTF file with the licence.<br />
<br />
Why clutter the install with a print button.  They<br />
can read it and choose not to install if they don't<br />
like it.  If the want to print it after the fact,<br />
they can do so after the install is complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petersa</div><div class="date">28th April 2001, 04:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Come to think of it, I see many installations that show a license, and have a license shortcut under the Start menu...<br />
<br />
I was guessing before that the people who had the slightest interest in the license in the first place, would know how to copy and paste somehting... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbareis</div><div class="date">6th May 2001, 07:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is a much bigger problem with the licence page and that is that there is no way to confirm a user agreed. So I suspect enforcement of any licence may be that much harder if ever required.<br />
<br />
I've seen other installers with AGREE and NOT AGREE buttons or radio buttons with the default being not agree, the second way is probably the best....</div></div><hr />

<br />
until the feature is implemented you could do it like that:<br />
<br />
Function PrintLicense<br />
MessageBox MB_YESNO 'Print License Agreement?' IDNO lbl_end<br />
ExecShell print whatever.txt<br />
lbl_end:<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
