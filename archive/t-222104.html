<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eboots</div><div class="date">21st July 2005, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm making an installer (setup.exe on a CD) for a commercial game.<br />
<br />
Currently, setup.exe is launched each time the CD is inserted (using autorun.inf).<br />
<br />
This is quite annoying for the player when he has already installed the game, as he needs to insert the CD to play the game.<br />
<br />
I would like to prevent this. I have 2 ideas:<br />
<br />
1/ Use an intermediate executable (let's call it check.exe)<br />
Have autorun.inf call check.exe instead of setup.exe<br />
check.exe checks if the game is installed (by looking at the registry) and decides whether or not to launch setup.exe.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
Has anybody done this?<br />
Are there freeware tools to make this quickly? I don't particularly want to reinvent the wheel...<br />
<br />
2/ Add a check (registry) in .onInit and cancel installation when the game is already installed.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
Has anybody done this?<br />
<br />
Is this really a good idea? Currently, my installer takes about one minute to launch before .onInit can do anything (&quot;Please wait while setup is loading...). Of course, i can disable that with &quot;CRCCheck off&quot;, but then i'm making my installer less secure...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your valuable help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 01:22</div></div><div class="posttext">It's much easier than that really.<br />
<br />
1. Write some registry key to say that the game is installed in your install Section.<br />
2. Get autorun.inf to pass an extra param to setup.exe, lets say /AUTORUN (in case user decides to run setup.exe to reinstall game).<br />
<br />
Combine the two, and if both are set you just call Abort.<br />
<br />
E.g.<br />
Function .onInit<br />
 Call GetParameters<br />
  Pop $R0<br />
 ReadRegStr $R1 &quot;HKCU&quot; &quot;Software\Company\Game&quot; &quot;Installed&quot;<br />
 StrCmp $R0 &quot;/AUTORUN&quot; 0 End<br />
  StrCmp $R1 &quot;1&quot; End<br />
   Abort<br />
 End:<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
GetParameters is in the NSIS Manual under Useful Scripts.<br />
<br />
Edit: As for CRCCheck, if your setup file is on a CD/DVD then it'll be less likely to be corrupt right? I think CRCCheck is only really necessary for packages to be downloaded from the Internet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 01:35</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to get into the nitty-gritty, you could include another NSIS executable on your CD called, say, MD5Check.exe which will:<br />
<br />
1. Be executed by setup.exe in .onInit (setup.exe will immediately call Abort)<br />
2. The executable will check the MD5 checksum of the setup file (using the MD5 plugin) by comparing it to a predefined checksum (defined on compile time).<br />
3. If they do not agree, give the user an error message (or something?)<br />
4. Otherwise, run setup.exe with another parameter, say /MD5OK and Abort itself too (all this should be done in .onInit)<br />
5. Finally, setup.exe will detect the /MD5OK param with GetParameters and continue with installation.<br />
<br />
Sounds a bit nasty though, plus the user getting that error message which would probably have to say &quot;Your CD is damaged!&quot; would not be a good idea ;)<br />

<br />
I did go through the pain of developing a launcher exe but then I read your replies and decided to follow your advice.<br />
<br />
It always sounds better when somebody else says it ;-)<br />
<br />
When I have time, i'll try to post my little launcher in case it's useful to someone.<br />
