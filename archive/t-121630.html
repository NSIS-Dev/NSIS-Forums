<br />
I was using TortoiseCVS 1.0.4 do download latest stuff of NSIS and everything worked well.<br />
Since I have installed new version=1.2.2 of the client then no update works even though I haven't change any setting.<br />
<br />
Please look at the snapshots attached and tell me whether there is<br />
some error in my configuration of TortoiseCVS, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th January 2003, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">That's probably a problem with SourceForge. They have some problems somtimes, they are hosting more than 50,000 projects after all ;)<br />
Your settings are right. Try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th January 2003, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">(2003-01-14 14:04:19)   As of 2003-01-14, pserver-based CVS repository access and ViewCVS (web-based) CVS repository access have been taken offline as to stabilize CVS server performance for developers. These services will be re-enabled as soon as the underlying scalability issues have been analyzed and resolved (as soon as 2003-01-15, if possible). Additional updates will be posted to the Site Status page as they become available. Your patience is appreciated.<br />
<br />
That should be the problem... :(<br />
This means the snapshot won't work either because it uses the anonymous CVS.</div></div><hr />

However, who knows when it will be turned back on.</div></div><hr />
