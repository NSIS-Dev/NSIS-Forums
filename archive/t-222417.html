<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">25th July 2005, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question about something I've never done before.  But first, some background:<br />
<br />
I want to make a custom installation confiramtion page to use with the Modern UI to display the user's options before the install.  The idea is that the user can press 'back' to make changes to the install parameters before continuing.  I'm planning to use this command to display the confirmation page:<br />
!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY 'confirmpage.ini'  <br />
<br />
So here's my question:<br />
When using the command above, does the page get refreshed each time it's loaded?  Or does it simply remain in memory and become 'hidden' when it's not used?  If it is hidden (rather than closed) is there a better command/procedure to use?  <br />
<br />
(The reason I ask is that I want to ensure that if the user clicks 'back' to make changes, that the new changes get reflected on the confirmation screen.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mæster</div><div class="date">25th July 2005, 06:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Your 'confirmpage.ini' is written by default to the temp folder (on your hard disk). If you leave the page all settings are written to the ini and reloaded if you return. Forget the 'memory' and 'hidden' theory - just dive in and expereance how easy it is to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">25th July 2005, 07:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that InstallOptions can write the user's input back to the INI file (and that the INI is stored in TEMP), but I just wasn't sure if I could change things manually after the initial call to display the page.  <br />
<br />
But, based on what you've said here, it sounds like I'll be OK.  I'll go ahead and try it and see what happens.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice, Mæster!</div></div><hr />
