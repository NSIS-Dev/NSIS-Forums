<br />
I am with NSIS since 3 years. Recently I found out by chance, that a plugin (RealProgress - http://nsis.sourceforge.net/RealProgress_plug-in) had a new release. I think I use the previous version for about 3 years. By looking at the wiki page there is no information about version progress or any version history. <br />
<br />
I do not want to complain first, I just want to know if someone has a some good hints how to handle the situation. I am sure that NSIS core developers already had a discussion about this topic. What is your strategy for an up2date NSIS system with recent version of 3rd party plugins?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I frequently check the wiki's &quot;Recent Changes&quot; page to help keep up to date with changes to the plugins I use:<br />
