There are many plugins that decide to write to the registry and leave info behind. Is there a way to keep my installer program from writing anything to registry at all?</div></div><hr />

If you can't tell that yourself how do you know that it even writes to registry? :p <br />
<br />
Seriously. What exactly you mean by &quot;all kinds of tracks in the registry&quot; and what plugins are you using?</div></div><hr />

Run any other application that you have e.g. winrar and you'll see similar new records.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torpark</div><div class="date">22nd January 2007, 00:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I want to make it where my installer leaves no traces behind, as it will be run off of USB. I don't want forensics to come along and say that my program was run on this machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">22nd January 2007, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Red Wine said those are all normal windows registry activities. And and if you delete those registry keys (writen without your permission) you might wreck your system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you speak of any TOR-app - it's a bit of paranoia you have.<br />
Or you really have suspicious mind.<br />
<br />
examining windows is like a open book to some people - but <br />
dont try too fool forensics - they have the better tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CancerFace</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are that worried about registry entries you can use RegShot (http://regshot.blog.googlepages.com/regshot.html) to get an image of the registry once you start your program (save it somewhere), then use UndoReg (http://neutronstar.cjb.net/) to undo any registry changes. You may have to use something like AutoIt (http://www.autoitscript.com/) to script the whole process since these tools may not offer an unattended mode. However there will always be volatile cache activity that you won't be able to remove ...<br />
I don't want forensics to come along and say that my program was run on this machine.Does this mean that you are trying to hide something? Are you sure that this is legal? And are you sure that this is the place to ask such questions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torpark</div><div class="date">25th January 2007, 02:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this is for a popular tor application. So yes, I don't want to leave tracks in any system if I can manage it. And certainly not anything that would help forensics. You can check out my app Torpark at www.Torrify.com<br />
<br />
And obviously the problem with UndoIt is that someone might make legitimate installations or changes with other programs and this would wipe it out.</div></div><hr />
