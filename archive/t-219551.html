<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prodoc</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 00:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Something that annoys me a lot is when a program adds new start menu items while they are already included from a previous installation. I have my start menu subdivided into different categories in which I place the start menu folder of a specific program. Because of this, when I e.g. update an existing program, it means that a new start menu folder of that program usually gets added again to the &quot;root&quot; of the start menu instead of it overwriting the old folder in a different location.<br />
<br />
Because of this I'm wondering if the following is possible with NSIS:<br />
- A way for the user, during installation, to be able to specify a more accurate location (nested instead of just the &quot;root&quot;) in which the installer should place the program folder in the start menu.<br />
- A way to keep track of the folder location of a specific program to use when reinstalling/updating again.<br />
- A way to detect a program folder in the start menu of a specific program (on reinstalling/updating) eventhough when it's not located in the &quot;root&quot;.<br />
<br />
If this is possible already, e.g. by using the scripting language, why wouldn't it be used more often? Would it be something that should be made easier to use/do somehow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MÃ¦ster</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 03:10</div></div><div class="posttext">All that requested stuff is already possible to do with nsis. Just take a look at the start menu example script &quot;[..]\NSIS\Examples\Modern UI\StartMenu.nsi&quot;<br />
<br />
If this is possible already, e.g. by using the scripting language, why wouldn't it be used more often?Because people dont know, are lazy or use another installer than nsis. Imho, the last reason is the worst :D.</div></div><hr />
