<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">f97ao</div><div class="date">20th August 2008, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm doing an installer for our Game Engine and tools to be used internally.<br />
<br />
The trick is that it requires a huge amount of windows components and programs to work for the developers. This I would like to automate. <br />
Does anyone know how to do this with NSIS?<br />
<br />
Examples are:<br />
- Visual Studio 2005 including SP1 (Developers)<br />
- the latest version of DirectX 9.0c SDK<br />
- NUnit<br />
- the Xbox360 SDK <br />
- the .NET 3.0 runtime. WinFX (this step is not needed if you run Vista)<br />
<br />
The problem with these application is that most do not have a way to do automatic or silent installtions. You have to click everything in the menues. One idea would be to collect all the files and registry changes that their installers do and then dump all these files and changes in my installation.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />

I have found out  how to do it mostly. I didnt know about the /? command before so know I find all the different settings for running managed or silent installations.<br />
<br />
My biggest trick right now is to figure out how to silently mount an iso image and install that one.<br />
