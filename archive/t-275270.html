<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dennisb555</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 08:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a custom page with a large multiline text area.<br />
<br />
I'd like to fill this text area in with the contents of a file (say 2-3k in size) if the file exists. The user can edit/hack this content to their desire.<br />
<br />
If the file does not exist then I want the user to have the ability to cut-n-paste content into this text area (which will later be saved to a file).<br />
<br />
My issue. How do I append into a text area from my NSIS script one line at a time (e.g. from the output of FileRead)?<br />
Is it even possible?<br />
<br />
I know I can append into a list box, but I can not use a list box in this case because the user needs to be able to edit and add content.<br />
<br />
The FileRead function works on a line by line basis. Hence, I believe I need to append into the text area as soon as a line has been read. Note, I can not append up a big string with the file content and then do a single WM_SETTEXT due to 1024 string length issues (my content may be more than 1024 characters).<br />
<br />
Is there some type of appending to text area 'SendMessage' I can use?<br />
<br />
Multiple &quot;SendMessage .. ${WM_SETTEXT} ..&quot; will not work since each SendMessage will overwrite rather than append to the text area.<br />
<br />
Gee, I hope &quot;Text&quot; controls can do what I want to do.<br />
<br />
Any assistence would be grateful.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think I figured it out.<br />
<br />
FileRead $0 $1<br />
SendMessage $R1 ${EM_REPLACESEL} 0 &quot;STR:$1&quot;<br />
<br />
appears to work.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm just coming up to speed with the loveliness that is Windows GUI programming.<br />

Append each line of the text to a variable as described here,<br />

and finally add it to the text field.</div></div><hr />
