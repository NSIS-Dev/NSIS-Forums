<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PerditionC</div><div class="date">21st December 2003, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Our build system uses cygwin tools, so file name &amp; path defines passed on the command line are easier done using forward slashes (/) instead of back slashes (\).  I thought previous versions of NSIS supported them (as long as it didn't start with a /)? but the current version doesn't seem to.<br />
<br />
E.g.<br />
Given<br />
Command line defined: &quot;OPT_CRTL_LOCAL=C:/Progra~1/Micros~2/REDIST/&quot;<br />
Command line defined: &quot;OPT_CRTL_FILENAME=msvcrt.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
Section &quot;CRTLIB&quot; section_crtlib_local<br />
	SectionIn 2 <br />
	SetOutPath $INSTDIR\${PRODUCT}\bin<br />
<br />
	File &quot;${OPT_CRTL_LOCAL}${OPT_CRTL_FILENAME}&quot;<br />
<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
results in<br />
File: failed opening file &quot;msvcrt.dll&quot;<br />
Error in script &quot;./AbiWord.nsi&quot; on line 562 -- aborting creation process<br />
<br />
using backslashes works (at least when overriding the define, as its a pain to get them from the make file for defining on the command line).  Any suggestions for workarounds other than figuring out how to get a \ in defines from the makefiles?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

NSIS needs to process the path to get the file name so it can extract files. To do that it searches for backslashes because that's the Windows standard. On the other hand, !cd just passes what it gets to SetCurrentDirecetory, so this might work:!cd &quot;${OPT_CRTL_LOCAL}&quot;<br />
File &quot;${OPT_CRTL_FILENAME}&quot;</div></div><hr />

You always have such simple solutions to my problems!<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
