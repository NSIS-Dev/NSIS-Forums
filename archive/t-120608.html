<br />
The quick launch folder for IE4 active desktop and above. If quick launch is not available, simply returns the same as $TEMP. The context of this variable (All Users or Current user) depends on the SetShellVarContext setting. The default is the current user.<br />
<br />
It seems that i get the $TEMP where and how can this be changed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK there is no Quick Luanch bar for all users. Use SetShellVarContext current and it whould work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bugge T. Jensen</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 08:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok That works, but really i want it to work for all users. I mean i like to have the shortcut in the quicklaunch bar no matter who is logged on !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you'll have to check with Microsoft on that one. Like I said, AFAIK there no such thing and I couldn't anything useful on MSDN. Please share if you find something useful about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">14th January 2003, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that there is no shared folder for the quick launch. You could, however, make a very, very small quiet installer that does only put shortcuts into the quicklaunch of a user. This installer would be an exe included in your package, installed when the rest is installed, and then you write an extra key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run (or RunOnce, but then it will be deleted afterwards). See the registry (make backups!) for examples on how to do this (I can't check it right now, I'm on a public computer).<br />
You have to delete the key afterwards. I cannot give you any details now. Just ask.<br />
<br />
It might now work, since Run and RunOnce are, I think, executed before the user is logged in. I have not tested it.</div></div><hr />
