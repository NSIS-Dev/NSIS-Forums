<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patforkin</div><div class="date">19th March 2012, 12:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo again today.<br />
In the posts I have made on this subject I forgot to ask if any member, had attempted to do what I want to do.<br />
I have created an E-Book in the form of a pdf file.<br />
With it I wish to package a listbox which is a tabulated translation of the E-Book. <br />
There is no pdf tool which can deal with such a publication.<br />
There is also no tool which will allow both to be opened from a command line and accessed.<br />
One needs an editor with such a capability and I have found none.<br />
If another member has combined two such file as either:<br />
1. A PDF text and a ListBox.exe or<br />
2. A PDF compiled to an exe together with a ListBox.exe,<br />
then I would like to have contact with that member.<br />
Thanks again and kind regards, patforkin.</div></div><hr />
