<br />
I'm installing an Internet application which requires a cookie to authenticate.  Because it's a low-risk application, I'm using persistent sesssions.  <br />
<br />
During the installation process, I'd like users to have to enter a login/password for the web portion of the service they've already signed up for... and after that step, they should never have to do it again.  <br />
<br />
There are a bunch of issues with this (checking for valid input, not letting users advance in the installation if they can't enter their login/pass correctly, grabbing the cookie back from teh response, and updating the registry appropriately) and I'd like to know if NSIS is up to the task (perhaps with a plugin or two).<br />
<br />
Anxiously waiting,<br />

<br />
appreciate the quick response,<br />
<br />
But I will be needing to get cookie i get back from the http header request.. as that is my way of authenticating the users ... a local cookie is stored on their system (in the registry) which will serve as authenticating them in the future</div></div><hr />

Firefox stores cookies under its profile folders, IE in $COOKIES and for other browsers... who knows!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chasetoys</div><div class="date">12th June 2006, 03:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there no way to retrieve the cookie header from a html Post/get request from within the NSIS installer?<br />
<br />
to address your concern afrow UK, i'm grabbing the cookie reponse, and then saving it off in the registry.  so i'm not relying on it to be a randomly on the system some place...<br />
<br />
so is there a way to do all of the things i need to with the nsis installer or no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th June 2006, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I see. Well, if InetLoad or NSISdl does not support the cookie header then you'd need to write your own plugin to do the job.<br />
