<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">em_te</div><div class="date">12th April 2004, 02:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi people I need some help on this. I don't understand the concept of the &quot;File&quot; command. (Even after reading the documentation.) Currently my installation does:<br />
<br />
...<br />
SetOutPath $TEMP<br />
File &quot;${FILENAME}&quot;<br />
Exec &quot;${FILENAME}&quot;<br />
...<br />
<br />
My question is, does the &quot;File&quot; command tell the compiler what file to include in the exe file, or does it tell the exe file where to extract?<br />
<br />
Currently my FILENAME constant holds the relative value &quot;runme.bat&quot; so it all goes well. But what if I want to run the compiler in another directory? So I set:<br />
<br />
!define FILENAME &quot;c:\docs\runme.bat&quot;<br />
<br />
and run:<br />
<br />
c:\My Documents\scripts\makensis.exe &quot;c:\My Documents\scripts\dual.nsi&quot;<br />
<br />
? The file &quot;runme.bat&quot; still gets included in the exe file (as expected) but when I run it, is the file still extracted to $TEMP or is it extracted to &quot;c:\docs\runme.bat&quot; on the target computer?<br />
How can I remedy this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th April 2004, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">It does both. It includes the file in the installer and it will extract it <br />
to the directory set by SetOutPath. <br />
<br />
In this case, even if the file is located in another directory, it will still be extracted to $TEMP.<br />
<br />
If you want to extract to another folder on run-time without using SetOutPath, you can use the /oname parameter with a filename.</div></div><hr />
