<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kc7bfi</div><div class="date">20th October 2009, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an install that prompts the operator to select which components to install. When re-running the install, I want to be able to detect if the user unselects a component and then uninstall that component. Has anyone done this? Are there any &quot;go bys&quot; for this case? Thanks, David</div></div><hr />

Are you going back to the components page using the 'back' button or you executing the installer again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">21st October 2009, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Check for the installed components (IfFileExists, or read some setting from the registry) in .onInit. Then enable those components with setsectionflags, and set some variables to remember them.<br />
<br />
Then simply create a hidden section that deletes all components that were pre-installed but got unchecked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kc7bfi</div><div class="date">21st October 2009, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for not being clear about re-running the install. What I want to be able to do is to re-execute the install program and allow them to check new components (which is working) and also to deselect previously selected components and have them uninstalled. Hope this is clearer.</div></div><hr />
