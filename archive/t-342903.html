<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patforkin</div><div class="date">5th March 2012, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo!<br />
Guidance is what one needs at the start of a process. <br />
I am a writer and not a programmer.<br />
Some of my work results in EBooks published as PDFs that are protected against printing and or copying. <br />
My two core themes at the moment are, <br />
1. Translating from English to German and <br />
2. Writing Correct English.<br />
To make the EBooks easier to read and learn from, I wish to add AutoHotKey ListBox scripts. <br />
Is NSIS the right tool for such a task?<br />
Are there forum members who are users of NSIS for the same or similar tasks?<br />
It would be good to get answers to both  and have a dialogue with those who reply. <br />
I use &quot;OpenOffice&quot; for both book themes.<br />
Regards and a nice day to all, patforkin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">5th March 2012, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You should ask the authors of AutoHotKey about this. Once you know what file/registry operations you need to perform, we can help you learn how to perform them using NSIS. In other words: You need to figure out the 'what' before we can help you with the 'how'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patforkin</div><div class="date">6th March 2012, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo!<br />
Your response sounded logical.<br />
As soon as I have had a response for AutoHotKey, I will get back to you.<br />
However there must be a simple answer to a question such as how do I begin to create a bundle of two or three files. One of these is an openoffice pdf and the othrs are one or two autohotkey scripts.<br />
Can I get an answer from you to get me on the road to getting such done?<br />
Regards and have a nice day, patforkin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">6th March 2012, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Your English is not very clear, I'm not sure if I understand you correctly.  If you want to create an installer that installs two or three files to the user's computer: This is very easy with NSIS.<br />
<br />
To learn NSIS, you should start by looking at NSIS\Example1.nsi and Example2.nsi. Learn what all the commands in those examples are for, and why they are used. You can use the command reference for this: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html<br />
Once you've done that, you will be well underway to building your own NSIS installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patforkin</div><div class="date">19th March 2012, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo!<br />
The last reply, to the thread I created said, that &quot;your English is not very clear&quot;.<br />
Why was that saud?<br />
What was it that I had said that was not clear?<br />
I am most particular about my English. <br />
It is my mother tongue and it allowed me to study in an English University.<br />
In any event I thank you for your well composed response. <br />
By the end of today I will have studied the examples and have tried to create the package that I need.<br />
If I have problems, I will come back to the forum with questions if I may?<br />
Is there a facility for having first attempts &quot;tested&quot;?<br />
Regards and thanks, patforkin</div></div><hr />
