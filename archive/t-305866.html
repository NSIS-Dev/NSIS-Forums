<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IYIaster</div><div class="date">30th April 2009, 04:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a lot of files being installed some are batch files. My question is how do you run batch files in silent mode? Next question is I have a progress bar when it's installing everything but some of the files are like 150mb and it takes a long time. So, when its installing these large files the progress bar just sits there. So, the person installing might think it has froze. Is there a way to add a progress bar that shows the progress of each file? If so can you have a progress bar for the whole install and then maybe one under that for each file. With maybe a message saying whats being installed?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">30th April 2009, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Run batch files using ExecDos (or nsExec). There is no code in NSIS at present to display a secondary progress bar, but there are 2 plugins on the Wiki which you could try that allow you to control the progress bar (one of which I wrote myself but I haven't worked on in a VERY long time and there appears to be some bugs in it).<br />
<br />
You should get more information on files (i.e. % extracted) if you use SetCompressor /solid lzma.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IYIaster</div><div class="date">1st May 2009, 07:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help! I see what your saying about SetCompressor /solid<br />
and it does show you a progress bar while its transferring the zip file from the install to the pc and it would work perfectly if it was not just moving the zip file but extracting the zip file to the right directory and had that % is there anyway to do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lewellyn</div><div class="date">1st May 2009, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Afrow UK was referring to his plugin listed on the wiki (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/RealProgress_plug-in) for manual progress bar control.<br />
<br />
And if you want it taken care of &quot;automagically&quot;, and aren't afraid of recompressing your zip files into &quot;7-zip&quot; format, take a look at the Nsis7z plugin (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Nsis7z_plug-in), specifically Nsis7z::ExtractWithDetails. Although, honestly, at that point you're best off just letting NSIS install them to the right place, usually. After all, 1) it's what NSIS is made for; 2) 7-zip uses LZMA (and can do solid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IYIaster</div><div class="date">1st May 2009, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I would allow nsis to extract the files if I knew how. But, the directories that are being installed have 1000's of files so I would have to make a cmd for each file RIGHT? I hope not. If there was a way to just load a directory that would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lewellyn</div><div class="date">1st May 2009, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at the fine manual. ;) In the Instructions section, find the File instruction. (Hint, it's gonna be in Chapter 4 of the manual...)<br />
<br />
<br />
File /r &quot;Z:\This is where my source files are\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Look for syntax like that. :)</div></div><hr />
