<br />
i am trying to add a registry string. I don't mean to create a new key with an value, but reading out an existing and updating it's value.<br />
<br />
The key value holds several path seperated with an &quot;;&quot; and I simply want to check, if  my path is already in it and if not readign the current value and adding my path, writting the complete value back. Also I need to delete my path out of the key, if I uninstall the program. However it could be that another path was added, so I cannot simply delete the last characters. I need to know the exact position to get it out.<br />
<br />
Found none string manipulation for this operation in the documentation. How would it be the best to handle this problem?<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
Phobeus</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are two functions in there. One to add a directory to the path and one to remove it. It works on both Windows NT and 9x. If it's not the path you want to change it's still a good example of how to process the kind of string you wish to process.</div></div><hr />
