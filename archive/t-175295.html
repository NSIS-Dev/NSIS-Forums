Loading Bar UI<br />
<br />
Loading Bar UI for NSIS is a special UI used to create a real &quot;Loading Bar&quot; [on startup or any other time] for any installer.<br />
<br />
See readme for more details (I made it so fast, probably it has some spelling errors).<br />
<br />
(I posted it here to see your opinions)</div></div><hr />

I normally use this UI for installers that download things, like updates or something. When I download things the loading bar just stops in the middle until the download is done then starts moving again. If it's like a 3MB download, and the persons on dial-up it can take a while to download and the bar just sits there. Is there a way to make it so that when NSISdl is called it replaces the text area with another loading bar to show the download progress? Or could it replace the loading bar already there for a loading bar that shows download progress?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, right now I can't, I'm working more on InstallOptionsEx project than even using NSIS. But I don't expect to make plugins, just to modify already existant ones to gain experience.<br />
<br />
would be nice to have some combination of a splash with that progressbar, since i'd be interested in using a ui like this progress-bar (with an image above).<br />
<br />
Hmmm... I think you can run the loading bar first (with Wait command and use System plugin to position the loading bar below the image (or somewhere else). Anyways, it's ever better to have a plugin to do all that for you, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to change the UI so it shows another progress bar under it?<br />
<br />
You can't do that without creating another plugin. However you could make show the banner bigger enough to support the original appearance of instfiles page when using NSISdl (without the buttons).</div></div><hr />

But there's a big space between the two. Is there any way I can move the NSISdl progress bar or would I have to edit the source of the plugin?</div></div><hr />

I'm not much for programming except for NSIS, VBS, HTML, CSS, etc. I've never worked with system plugins or anything before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tupsan</div><div class="date">5th August 2005, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Great thing that LoadingBar.

The only thing you should note is that all the code for the progressbar to move should be in its script, not in your script.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">28th February 2011, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">That icon used is the executable icon. Use !define MUI_ICON (MUI) or Icon to set it.<br />
