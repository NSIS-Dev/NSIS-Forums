<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rear_laura</div><div class="date">15th March 2007, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a major problem trying to remove the folder (and its shorcuts) from start menu while uninstalling. It works well if user doesn't change name or path of the application...But if user changes the name or the path of the app, it doesn't remove these folders at all. It seems like nsis is unable to get the path where the app is located...strange isn't it? <br />
I've found a post here that talks about the same problem, and some of you recommend using WriteINIStr and ReadINIStr, but I don't know how to use this! Anyway, how I am supposed to give a fixed path if it can be changed by the user (which is in fact, my problem!)<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me! I'm a little scared, I need to finish the installer right now ! I don't have more time!!<br />
<br />
Please heeeeeeeeeeelp!<br />
<br />
PD. Sorry for my poor english :P</div></div><hr />

Anyway, magically, it's working now! I cannot understand.... Buuuuuuuuuuut (now I'm startint to cry), I have a new problem....My app is located at: <br />
<br />
folder1/folder2/myApp.exe<br />
<br />

<br />
As for your new prob, I think you need GetParent,<br />
