<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpod</div><div class="date">10th July 2005, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">AVG Free Edition just today popped up 4 &quot;Downloader.Apropo.CA Trojan Horse&quot; &quot;Virus found!&quot; alerts, one each for the following NSIS-based install/uninstall programs:<br />
<br />
JavaHMO 2.4 installer<br />
JavaHMO 2.4 uninst.exe<br />
Galleon beta 10 installer<br />
Galleon beta 12 installer<br />
<br />
Galleon and JavaHMO are both SourceForge TiVo-related projects.  Their developer pointed me to the link ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/index.php?id=2&amp;backPID=2&amp;tt_news=24 ) that led me here.  Based on the info from that page I assume Grisoft just updated its definitions and AVG is now wrongly reporting the NSIS plugin.  <br />
<br />
I know nothing about this NSIS but that link said I should report false detections in this forum, so here's this post.  AVG Free Edition's home page is here:<br />
<br />
http://free.grisoft.com/doc/1<br />
<br />
But I wouldn't be surprised if their commercial versions were also affected:<br />
<br />
http://www.grisoft.com/<br />
<br />
Forgot to add: my AVG installation updates its virus definitions daily at 3:00am, So I assume this is due to a definition update that occurred between Friday and Saturday mornings (Pacific Time).</div></div><hr />

I haven't noticed any problems, but then again I don't use Galleon or JavaHMO.<br />
<br />
My version of AVG Free is 7.0.323.  Just downloaded the latest updates this morning and did a full system scan and found nothing.  (And I have quite a few application installs from SourceForge.)<br />
<br />
Still, it probably wouldn't hurt to report the problem to AVG anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MamiyaOtaru</div><div class="date">12th July 2005, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Been getting a lot of reports like this lately.  All in the last few weeks people who have downloaded the Privateer Remake (http://wcuniverse.sourceforge.net) have been complaining of positives from Bullguard, and now AVG.  <br />
<br />
bullguard thread (http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4484&amp;sid=ca18cc57dfe83f81769d0109d7e0a455)<br />
AVG thread (http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4545&amp;sid=ca18cc57dfe83f81769d0109d7e0a455)<br />
<br />
Pretty freaking annoying: people always seem to assume the worst.  No one ever wonders why theirs is the only program picking something up.  It's just easier to assume we are malicious :-/</div></div><hr />

No false reports this morning.<br />
