<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">23rd August 2005, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm writing a plugin that will read the PendingFileRenameOperations key from the registry so I see what the system will be removing on reboot.  Anyways, I've noticed that the uninstaller will write invalid (empty) strings to this registry value, which causes my read registry function to return with not everything read in because the uninstaller will write out a line containing '\0' between each file to delete on reboot.  Is this a bug that needs to be fixed?</div></div><hr />
