Please don't reply to very old and loosely related threads with new questions. It sends a notification message to all thread posters and merges two loosely related questions into one thread.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I thought it would be better to cut down on the number of new threads. <br />
<br />
It's part of the required structure, as far as I can tell. If it's possible to get rid of it, MSDN will have the answer.<br />
I couldn't find anything in MSDN, and playing around with a .rc file, it doesn't seem to let you correctly create a new block unless the header item is the language.<br />
<br />
Oh well, no big deal. I was curious because I noticed the lavasoft ad-aware installer (non-NSIS) does not have the language info.</div></div><hr />
