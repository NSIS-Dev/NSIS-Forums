<br />
I have my current nsis script which install all files etc.. and works ok. I was wanting to know if its possible before the installer finishes if I could have a popup with a drive selection so I can add / install one file to that specific location?<br />
<br />
The reason is i need to add a lock file to a usb device before the program is run for the first time so could do with being able to give the option to the user installing the program.<br />
<br />
If anyone has done this or has an example it would be appreaciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance<br />
<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />
