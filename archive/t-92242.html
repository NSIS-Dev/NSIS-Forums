It's not that difficult what you want, but since I only get paid for my real job and not by NullSoft, I cannot free the time to do this for you.<br />
<br />
If you have detailed questions about commands or how to scripts certain functions you want to create, read the docs, search the Forum and if that does not work, feel free to ask and maybe we can help.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, to help you a bit, allowing only one component to be selected can only be done by using RadioButtons in InstallOptions. Otherwise you would have to check user input after the componentspage and give an error everytime 2 or more components have been selected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
