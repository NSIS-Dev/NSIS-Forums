<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chrisairpac</div><div class="date">14th July 2009, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem that occurs after a customer installs on some variants of Windows. When they launch the installed app, it starts a windows installer instead of the app. Usually, they can cancel and the app runs fine.<br />
<br />
What I think is going on is I haven't registered all DLL's/OCX's and some Win variants try to resume the install.<br />
<br />
Any input/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If it fails to run it might tell you what needs fixing.<br />

I am unable to recreate the problem on my PC's (XP SP2, Vista 32bit Home Basic, Vista 64bit Home Premium) and asking my customers to run cleanup utility may be problematic.<br />
<br />
My current solution is to use a different installer which fixes the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip. I'll run the cleanup utility on my systems to see if any clues emerge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chrisairpac</div><div class="date">15th July 2009, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure the files aren't being deleted by the user since they run the install then immediately try to run the program. I send these customers a new install using Advanced Installer and everything works fine. I do think the problem is related to missing or unregistered files. I use the following to register DLL's:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro InstallLib REGDLL NOTSHARED REBOOT_NOTPROTECTED &quot;any.dll&quot; &quot;$SYSDIR\any.dll&quot; $SYSDIR</div></div><hr />
