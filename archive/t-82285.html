<br />
I want to associate .rtf and .txt files with the editor I've just finished writing - it takes &quot;filename&quot; as a parameter. I'd also like to have 'Open with editor' as a right-click option for all files. I know that associations are stored in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT group, and I know that NSIS has functions for working with the registry, but I'm not sure how to actually define these associations. Can someone help? (I've searched far and wide on Google, and I've gone through the last 500 threads on this forum, but I'm none-the-wiser...)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestion for NSIS: I know that it has registry functions, but perhaps a function specifically for associations would be useful...<br />
<br />
TIA, Andy</div></div><hr />

Might even be the NSIS one. Otherwise this topic has been covered a couple times on the board so someone will have the answer.</div></div><hr />
