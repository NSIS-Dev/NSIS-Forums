Is there any way to write uninstall file separately when build install file? We need setup.exe and uninstall.exe files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">You can create another installer which will actually uninstall. You can also make it a dummy installer that just extracts the uninstaller to $EXEDIR and execute the dummy installer directly after creating it. Another possibility is a switch for the real uninstaller that makes it silently extract the uninstaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">romko2005</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">It's easy way copy&amp;paste unninstall instruction in another file and build it. But when I fix unininstall section in first file I must do the same in second file. Inconveniently :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">romko2005</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand, WriteUninstall command make uninstall exe file, but setup builder pack it and delete from disk. Can I save this file on disk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Then use one of the other two methods, maintain the uninstaller code in the other file, or have one script which can generate both the installer and the uninstaller depending on a define.</div></div><hr />

As I understand, WriteUninstall command make uninstall exe file, but setup builder pack it and delete from disk. Can I save this file on disk? WriteUninstaller doesn't create the uninstaller, pack it and then delete it. The uninstaller is created only on runtime.</div></div><hr />

As for IRC, download a client, or use an online one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why separate uninstaller...<br />
There are Setup programm Version 1.0, Setup programm Version 2.0 and Upgrade for version 2.0. <br />
<br />
Setup 1.0 install uninstall.exe for Version 1<br />
Setup 2.0 install uninstall.exe for Version 2<br />
Upgrade 2.0 for users, who has Version 1 and download upgrade via internet, must REWRITE uninstall.exe for Version 1.0 to Version 2.0<br />
<br />
I make Upgrade 2.0 as NSIS installer and need uninstall.exe for Version 2.0 &quot;in raw&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

Understand.<br />
Copy&amp;paste all unninstall code from install 2.0 to upgrade 2.0.</div></div><hr />
