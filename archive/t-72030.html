<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pomflain</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Been running 1.94 installers on XP and it's tending to hang on the extraction of files.  Using the standard zlib compression,  and it doesn't happen on my 2000 system.  Haven't checked on any other OS versions,  we just moved yesterday and I've only got these ones set up yet.  It's locking up on random files,  and it's only happening on XP.  Haven't tried a version with 1.91,  but I built a version with 1.61 and the problem didn't happen.  Wanted to try a really old version to see if it would happen,  and it ran fine with 1.61.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

If it is built on XP, it works for a little bit then it will persist. But the best part of XP is the compatiblity mode ... Just set it to Windows 98 or 2000.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 07:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Do this on executables and shortcuts<br />
<br />
Right Click &gt; Select &quot;Properties&quot; &gt; Click on the &quot;Compatibility&quot; tab and then click the box that says: &quot;Run This Program in Compatibility Mode&quot; then choose which Operating System you want it to be ran on. I did this for an Adobe Acrobat writer installer that would only run on Windows NT4<br />
