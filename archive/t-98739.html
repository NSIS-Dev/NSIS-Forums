<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xombie</div><div class="date">12th August 2002, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I looked around at the other posts similiar to this and I don't think I saw this one before.  I made a simple installer for this program I have.  Mostly it just copies support files (dlls) to directories &amp; makes shortcuts since the actual program is on the network.  Installing to a Windows NT machine causes no problems but when I install to a Windows 2000 machine two files don't seem to get registered - msjet35.dll and dao350.dll.  No error message is generated during install but when the program is launched it gives error messages meaning it couldn't find the correct version (or any version) of those two files.  Going to a command prompt and doing &quot;regsvr32 blah blah&quot; works because the files get copied.  It just doesn't seem to register them.<br />
<br />
I'm using the UpgradeDLL macro and a sample call goes like this:<br />
<br />
	SetOutPath $SYSDIR<br />
	ClearErrors<br />
	Push &quot;$SYSDIR\msjet35.dll&quot;<br />
	!define DLL_NAME msjet35.dll<br />
	!insertmacro UpgradeDLL<br />
<br />
I apologize if something like this was posted and if it was, please direct me to where.  Otherwise, I'd really like some help on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I would recommend seraching MSDN, Microsoft support, and of course Google. You can try DevShed forums (http://forums.devshed.com/) too.<br />
<br />
If no one has answered up until now, I guess no knows the answer. I sure don't :(<br />
<br />
I hope you can find something in those other places... Good luck!</div></div><hr />

The NT4 installer already contains this files, so installing them again doesnt have any effect, your software will run anyway.<br />
With W2000 comes msjet400, a newer version, so if you want to use V3.50, it must be correctly installed, and this means that you will need much more than just those two files.<br />
In adition to that, I have to say the following:<br />
- if your software insists on msjet250, meaning that it will not work with newer MDAC versions, you are doing something wrong ;)<br />
- do you really think that is is a good idea to replace a newer MDAC with an older one, causing other installed software to stop working?<br />
- if MDAC could be installed with just the two mentioned files, then why has the MS MDAC installer a size of nearly 8 MB?</div></div><hr />
