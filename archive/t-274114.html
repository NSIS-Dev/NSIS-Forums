<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fffizzz</div><div class="date">9th July 2007, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a software package called LANDesk, and your allowed to setup installation packages to be deployed to new clients. The package runs silently, but what we were wanting to do is this.<br />
<br />
Create a install that basically installs about 10 other applications, all silently and without interaction..<br />
office 2k3<br />
reflection<br />
adobe acrobat reader<br />
ect..<br />
<br />
Is this within the scope of this software?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">9th July 2007, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep. NSIS runs silently, is able to compress/extract files and execute them awaiting to step ahead once the execution is finished, or execute from a given location e.g. cd/dvd drive without the need of compression.<br />
<br />
Actually many users prefer NSIS for that kind of installer, a forum search might offer you a lot of useful info.</div></div><hr />
