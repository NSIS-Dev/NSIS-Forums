I a new user to NSIS and would like to know if there is some way to do the following.  I would like to build an installer one time on a windows pc and then later on replace some of the files in the installation with new files.  I have an application that is built on solaris using java (server and client application) and it has a windows pc client that would be nice to have a windows installer.  The client jar file changes on a nightly basis and I don't want to have to rebuild the entire installer on a windows pc everytime there is a change. Is there anyway to do this with NSIS?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can however use an emulator like Wine to run makensis on a Linux system.<br />
<br />
Porting makensis (not the installer VM itself but the compiler) to another platform should also be possible, but that will require some work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stnchris</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">you could use CopyFiles rather than File in your install script. Just built the install script once, and use that rarely-rebuilt version to install the nightly-rebuilt .jar files.<br />
<br />
The .jar files would be external to the install script, install them like:<br />
<br />
CopyFiles &quot;$EXEDIR\jarfiles\file1.jar&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\file1.jar&quot;</div></div><hr />
