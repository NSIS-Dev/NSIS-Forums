<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">30th April 2006, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a bit complicated as it involves several registry entries under HKCR.<br />
<br />
Here's a MSDN article that might help get you started:<br />

<br />
Unfortunatley, I don't have any idea of whether or not there is a plugin, external command, etc. that would make this easier to change.  (The only other thought I had was perhaps re-installing the Java runtime.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You of course change the registry key...I think its HK_CLASS_ROOT/jarfile/open/command...etc...</div></div><hr />

I am trying to make my installer execute a .jar file/application with a parameter. I am trying to use <br />
MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN and MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_PARAMETERS but I cannot get it to work. <br />
Can you explain how you are running your executable .jar file?</div></div><hr />
