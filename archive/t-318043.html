<br />
But if you want to force a non service app to run as a service, there was a tool that did this in one of the NT resource kits.</div></div><hr />

Is your application an actual service executable? If it isn't then you must use Srvany.exe (from the Windows NT Resource Kit) but that is lazy if you ask me. To create and delete services you can use a plug-in such as SimpleSC.<br />

<br />
<br />
i am creating an application in java swings, create an exe using the Xenoage software(used to convert jar 2 exe). <br />
<br />
I used the SimpleSC.dll.  I download and copied in my NSIS Plugins application path, as per the instruction given.<br />
<br />
I created the service and it is added in the the &quot;Services&quot; but i can't able to start the service. I kept the service start as automatic, it is not starting. Manually also i tried but it is not starting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already done this one. but this not my requirement. it has to start before login.</div></div><hr />

Edit: And for the record, if you want to show a user interface in your service, you cannot on Windows Vista and upwards. For older versions of Windows you must use the SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS service type flag or programmatically launch your UI process under the current user with CreateProcessAsUser.<br />
