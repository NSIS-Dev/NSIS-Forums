<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vmorland</div><div class="date">29th October 2010, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a very simple installation script that places a few files in specific directories on the user's PC.  I have been running this successfully for a long time on my PC, but I would like to automate the process so that the installation file is created on my website.<br />
<br />
I have studied the NSIS documentation, read the Wiki, and searched the forum, but can find nothing about this.<br />
<br />
My website is on GoDaddy.com (on a shared server) and I use php.  Here is what I would like to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Create the user files on the server<br />
 Run MakeNSIS on the server to bundle the files into an installation executable<br />
 Send the user an email with a link to the installation routine<br />
<br />
I can do #1 and #3, but I cannot find any guidance on #2.  Has anyone done this or something like it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

One way would be to have wine installed on this machine. Then you can run the makensis compiler through wine.<br />
<br />
But this can only work if you have enough permissions on the machine to install software and run shell scripts.</div></div><hr />

You can compile on POSIX systems</div></div><hr />

Would you mind share a working example?</div></div><hr />
