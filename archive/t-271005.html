 <br />
            I am trying to develop an installer which should be set to disable state after installation is successful. If i make count of the installer runs by initializing with zero and  increase the count upon .onInstSuccess function.When the user tries to run installer next time, installer aborts.As sometimes users who downloaded the installer file may pass on to illegal users which we want to prevent.<br />
<br />
           I am stuck with the count value storage: as can i store the count value on the stack or temporary folder? If the  temporary folder is stored on user machine it will be useless.Is there any way to handle the storage of data.<br />
<br />
Could anyone please suggest me whether the above idea is sufficient enough to prevent the illegal use or pass on any new suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

But this would also be easy to bypass, because someone could download the file and then make a copy before they execute it the first time.<br />
<br />
The protection you are trying to create is dificult to do, especially if you want to prevent a semi-knowledgeable user from defeating it. I think the best method is to have a registration key generated by your website and dependent upon some machine or user specific data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least, not without being defeated easily.<br />
<br />
1) I would just make a copy of the original file first.<br />
<br />
2) I would make the Installer's .exe unwritable,<br />
(say by burning it off to a CD first).<br />
Then I would run the Installer from that image.<br />
You aren't going to be able to mod the Installer image on the CDROM, so my image would remain pristine and useable over and over.<br />
<br />
I don't think you will find an easy solution to your problem.<br />

 Thanks alot for sharing your thoughts. If we generate the registration key for installer , is there any possibility that i can make the key useful for onetime installation process. I will go in depth to explain the issue as if we want the user to have the key which should be useful for onetime and should not allow the other user if he uses the same key with a copied installer.<br />
<br />
   I really need your suggestions...<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.<br />
Implement the desired security in application side rather than installer side.<br />
Go find on market a scheme that suits your requirements or build your own to secure your software.<br />
An activation method like those used by microsoft (WGA-OGA) or Adobe or Symantec etc would be great idea.<br />
If you insist to implement a method in installer side, here is a good one,<br />
