I need some help. There are many posts about rebuking to uninstall the previous version of the app first, before installing the next one.<br />
But I want to create update-setup so that before installing the update the installer will check if there is any stable version installed and terminate if no such stable version is found.<br />
Coul you please help mi how to solve this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">20th July 2005, 05:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Every application has some part of itself behind that will tell you if it's present and if so what version it is.  This is usually a particular registry value or a file value (such as an INI file) or perhaps a certain version of DLL.  Occasionally, it involves a more advanced approach.  (If you've ever had to figure out the MDAC version on a PC, you'll know what I'm talking about!)<br />
<br />
But once you find out that special &quot;thing&quot;, then it's just a matter of looking for it and doing something based on the results.</div></div><hr />

You know, that's my own application that I need to create the installer for. So there are many informations stored in the registy describing the version of the software. for example HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\My_application<br />
There we can find info about version, installDir ect.<br />
So perhaps I need to force my installer to read this info and if the returned string does not contain the number of the stable version then the installer will display a proper message. Am I right ? If so, please help me how to perform this.</div></div><hr />
