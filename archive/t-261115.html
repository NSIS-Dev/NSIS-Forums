<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 02:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys, trying to install a 3 component application onto pocket pc's. The trouble i'm having is the user having to accept the success screen on the device before the next component will install successfully. I have tried a demo program called Pocket PC Installer (http://www.pocketpctoolkit.com/) and this is able to install all 3 components without any promts (or minimal). Problem is that it is ugly, and doesn't create all the registry settings and shortcuts properly.<br />
<br />
So i think what i have to do is somehow run the installer from the pocket pc, so maybe copy the installer, then run it from the device.<br />
<br />
Or alternatively, is there a way to wrap more than one CAB file into a single, then have this single CAB install all CAB files inside. I have tried doing this and putting it in the startup folder, but on devices where the promt is a problem the install still fails.<br />
<br />
Any help at all would be of much help.<br />
<br />
thanks v much, ZBD</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drudkh</div><div class="date">12th December 2006, 00:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Unforunately, no. The only silent installation the NSIS work was not asking user to select the components to install.<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
	SetSilent silent<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
That's it. When NSIS calls InstallCab, the ActiveSync will still ask the user &quot;Yes, No, Cancel&quot; and on the PPC, its still the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am working on another solution, invoking RAPI and using CeCreateProcess to make wceload.exe run with /noui or /silent, i think this is a little more promising, the pc side is fine, just the prompts on the PPC screen is the issue<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply</div></div><hr />
