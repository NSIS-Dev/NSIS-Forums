<br />
I am packaging up an application with multiple 'levels' of features, and I'd like to *show* the levels that a user has not purchased (a hint to upgrade), but they would obviously need to be unchecked *and* read-only, so the user can't select them.<br />
<br />
These sections won't actually need to *do* anything, as separate installers are created for each 'level'.  So there's no issue of them actually getting levels they aren't entitled to...<br />
<br />
I've tried using the /o flag on the Section, and SectionIn without any index parameters.  But setting SectionIn RO overrides these and checks the section...</div></div><hr />
