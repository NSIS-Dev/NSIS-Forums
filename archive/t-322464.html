<br />
I've got a NSIS installer that I want to add repair support to.  I have set NoRepair=0 in the registry so the Repair button shows up in Add/Remove Programs -&gt; support information, but I don't know what value to create to point to my exe so it gets run when the user clicks Repair.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this is possible with NSIS?  I did a search here and found a few old threads, but none of them seem to have been resolved.  One of the threads suggested defining ModifyPath, but that does nothing when the Repair button is clicked.  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />

(DWORD)WindowsInstaller=1<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this also makes the ARP applet actually invoke the Windows Installer (msiexec).. which of course won't work here.<br />
<br />
It's one of many ways that Microsoft has been pushing people to use the Windows Installer - as now you have no choice but to use a kludgy solution instead.. letting the user 'remove' your product, but then actually present to the user a dialog that asks them what they -really- want to do.</div></div><hr />

Right - but that is cosmetic and while it does clarify to the user that the entry offers both choices, the Applet itself will still only have the 'Remove' button shown/enabled/etc.<br />
( I use SAFARP, so I'm not entirely too sure what ARP looks like these Win7 days :) )<br />
<br />
MSFT could have easily let other installers be supported by these methods; but alas.<br />
<br />
I suppose.. if you -really- wanted to.. you could grab WiX and make a near-empty shell MSI installer which gets handled by the msiexec, and would launch your -actual- NSIS installer/uninstaller. ( or so I presume )</div></div><hr />
