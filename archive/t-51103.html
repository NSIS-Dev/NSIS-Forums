<br />
NSIS doesn't like it if you specify a wildcard File option that returns no files. My case is a database installer for an app I'm writing. 99% of the time, there will be files in subdirectory &quot;sop&quot;, but that 1% of the time there won't. NSIS complains about no files and dies. Instead, it should be allowed to fail gracefully, since that simply means there's nothing to install this go-around. IE:<br />
<br />
File sop\*.sop  &lt;-- right now this fails if sop directory is empty.<br />
<br />
File /i sop\*.sop  &lt;-- my suggestion-the /i flag will ignore the empty sop directory and keep going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saivert</div><div class="date">30th May 2001, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey you! You must differenciate between compile time and run time command. Firstly: File is a runtime command and you didn't tell whether or not your error happended during installataion while running your NSIS installer program or if it happended during compile of a .nsi script.<br />
<br />
Please provide more info on this and I can help you.</div></div><hr />
