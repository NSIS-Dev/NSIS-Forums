<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">10th November 2001, 06:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious everybody, anybody have any comments/problems with NSIS 1.63 beta? I was worried that the changes could cause problems (hence the 'beta') but I haven't heard anything about it. Any successes/failures? I'd like to move it to non-beta if no problems have been found... :)<br />

Could you update the contrib directory with the newest copy of Install Options.  You can grab it from http://installoptions.sf.net/io.zip<br />
<br />
This version adds checkboxes &amp; option buttons.  It changed a bit of other source code, but nothing major.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

My script file weighs in at a hefty 16k.  I think I am using every NSIS function available.  If anything comes up you'll be the first to know.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problems?  There's a small bug in CEXEBuild::do_add_file I think.  When using /r to recurse into subdirectories, the code added to double-up '$' symbols does not null-terminate the output string.<br />
<br />
As for the changes to strings - when I was testing it I changed VAR_CODES_START to some silly value like 65 to highlight any strings that weren't being processed in the installer when they should and vice-versa.  You might want to do the same for a final check.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I've not been able to use the later NSIS's for my installers at work as they are using a heavily customised version of 1.44.  I keep meaning to have a go a re-doing the changes in the latest NSIS... (some of which are not needed anymore because new NSIS features can be made to do the same!)<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it appears to be working great :-)<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry about forgetting to comment out the printfs.. they were supposed to end up as #ifdefs but I forgot.<br />
<br />
It seems fine, I built a few inistallers with custom icons and bitmaps etc and it seemed to work okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">11th November 2001, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS 1.64 is here.. cool (what happened to 1.63 final?) :) <br />
<br />
Ar.. that makes this feature request a bit late then :( <br />
  static const char VarNames[] =<br />
  ...<br />
  &quot;CMDLINE\0&quot;       // 13<br />
  ...<br />
        ...<br />
        case VAR_CODES_START + 13 : // CMDLINE<br />
          lstrcpy(out, GetCommandLine());<br />
          break;<br />
        ...<br />
Could something like that be added?  My own selfish reasons for asking, of course ;) but come to think of it, maybe it could pave the way to transfering some of the uninstaller code for copying to the temp directory etc to NSIS script?!!!<br />
<br />
