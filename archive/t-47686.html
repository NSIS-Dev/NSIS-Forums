<br />
 - Labels instead of jump values for Jump/IfFileExists/etc<br />
   You declare labels like:<br />
<br />
Poop: File C:\hi.dat<br />
   IfFileExists C:\hi.dat 0 Poop ; try again if it's not there.<br />
   <br />
 - Sections have to be ended with SectionEnd.<br />
<br />
 - Rewrote a lot of the compiler in one big-ass class, so you could make a program that uses it to generate executables directly (i.e. not having to write out a .nsi file and calling makensis, but simply creating a build object, and doing build.parseCommand(&quot;File whatever.exe&quot;) etc, then calling build.writeOutput()). Also simplified much of the code by using GrowBuf objects instead of realloc()ing so much.<br />
<br />
 - Added GetFullDLLPath command (to get the full path to a DLL from the dll name)<br />
<br />
 - Fixed a lot of little bugs, created a lot of little bugs.<br />
<br />
Planned: <br />
 - more bugfixes and cleanups<br />
 - CompareDLLVersions command/instruction.<br />
<br />
Anyway, expect it on firehose.net/free/nsis in a couple days..<br />
<br />

<br />
Have you been watching what all us NSIS fanatics have been up to recently with our multiple projects?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cablenut</div><div class="date">21st April 2001, 08:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Justin I have to say NSIS really fucking rocks. You update it with kickass features/improvements all the time (I don't know how you have time apart from winamp/shoutcast/nullsoft all other things to do it) at any rate keep the good free shit up! I have yet to use some of the new revivsions for my software deployment but I am wanting to...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">21st April 2001, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">With version checking NSIS is going to be brilliant - and give all commercial installers a run for their money.<br />
And with my little patch program, NSIS 'll do anything those commercial programs can!<br />
<br />
NSIS rocks. (and now I'm going to work on my patcher again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arune</div><div class="date">21st April 2001, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The labeling thing sounds great! Much easier when changing the nsi. <br />
It´ll be even more like asm... :)<br />
The version check command is also a feature I´d like, <br />
as usually program VB when it comes to win programming.<br />
<br />
NSIS had almost everything I wanted already in ver1.0 or something, <br />
but now it is very powerfull!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">samster</div><div class="date">22nd April 2001, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">This could well be one of the &quot;lot of little bugs&quot; but I thought it was best to mention it anyway...<br />
<br />
recursive_create_directory seems to be broken in v1.32 in that it doesn't work when paths more than 2 deep need to be created...  :eek:<br />
<br />
I did a quick compare with the previous version I was using (1.1h) and I think it's the change of char buf[] to static.<br />
<br />
Anyway, looking forward to 1.4!<br />
