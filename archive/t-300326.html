<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thivnor</div><div class="date">26th November 2008, 00:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to compile NSIS on an Ubuntu 0.04 system. Everything is up-to-date, including scons, gcc, and python. I believe I have followed the instructions at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixG.html.<br />
<br />
It seems the root problem is that I don't have an executable named &quot;o&quot; The key error is:<br />
<br />
scons: Building targets ...<br />
o build/release/makensis/build.o -c -Wno-non-virtual-dtor -O2 -Wall -m32 -D_WIN32_IE=0x0500 Source/build.cpp<br />
sh: o: not found<br />
<br />
I don't even know what &quot;o&quot; is ... there is no file on my system by that name. I suspect this is a scons glitch, and that somehow scons should be invoking cc or gcc. But I don't really know.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what is up with this? <br />
<br />
I've attached a text file with all the details.<br />
<br />
Also, FYI, I had to compile scons, as the package in the Ubuntu repository was just a twitch too old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, kichik, you rock. Thanks for pointing out the error in my ways.<br />
<br />
#apt-get install nsis<br />
<br />
All set now, thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having NSIS available in Debian's package database is WONDERFUL. <br />
<br />
However, it seems that only the most current Debian version is getting updates. For example Karmic Koala has NSIS 2.44, which lacks the Windows 7 fixes. My Debian, Hardy Heron, has NSIS 2.33 which is from 2007. <br />
<br />
I don't know much about package maintainers or how to appropriately contact them. But it would be wonderful if we could be making current NSIS versions available for all supported Debian systems. <br />
<br />
See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nsis or http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/pm/nsis for a listing of what Debian versions have what NSIS available. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to proceed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">That's how Debian is. You never get the latest version of any package with Debian stable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">f0rt</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can not wait or update to Debian &quot;Squeeze&quot; respectively Ubuntu &quot;Maverick Meerkat&quot; then there is the option to build NSIS yourself.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would recommend to take the latest available NSIS Debian source package from the testing (&quot;Squeeze&quot;) repository as a basis for a so-called backport (recompiled package).</div></div><hr />

Yuck. <br />
<br />
re: there is the option to build NSIS yourself.<br />
<br />
Yeah it sounds like I will have to do that.</div></div><hr />
