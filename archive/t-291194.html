<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lone Shepherd</div><div class="date">2nd May 2008, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">With my installer, I would like to provide the option of doing an upgrade install.<br />
<br />
What is the best way to accomplish this?<br />
<br />
I was thinking i might call the uninstaller and have it run silently (no UI) before doing the install; is that possible to do?<br />
<br />
Also, I've noticed if I run my installer and install to the same directory, overwriting the files that are there, the install is VERY slow; whereas doing a 'clean' install is fast.  What's up with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stb</div><div class="date">2nd May 2008, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Doing a silent uninstall for upgrades is a good idea. I use this in all my installers. You can have one installer that does all things you want this way:<br />
<br />
1. Detect if software is installed already (=&gt; UPDATE mode)<br />
2. If UPDATE mode: read current settings (INSTDIR, startmenu ...)<br />
3. If UPDATE mode: uninstall silently using something like this:<br />
   ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe&quot; /S _?=$INSTDIR' <br />
4. If NOT UPDATE mode: ask user for INSTDIR, startmenu ...<br />
5. Install new software version and store INSTDIR, startmenu and more somewhere (e.g. registry) for later use (step 2)</div></div><hr />
