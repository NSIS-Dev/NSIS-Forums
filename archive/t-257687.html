<br />
I would like to check if a certain dll is already registered on the computer.<br />
I think this would go best by having the GUID of the file as the files to check may vary from time to time.<br />
Is there a way to check the GUID by code?<br />
<br />
any help would be appreciated,<br />
thanks in advance,<br />
OC.</div></div><hr />

You can simply always register to be sure, or register one time on your computer and check which CLSID it used using RegMon (http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Regmon.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">17th October 2006, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">You should just call a function of the ActiveX DLL and handle the response code. If you try to access an DLL that is not installed on the system Windows give this in an errorcode.<br />
<br />
Going straight to GUID's is not futureproof since an new version of an ActiveX DLL can have any value.</div></div><hr />

in my case it's not good to register them everytime because I would like the things to be portable<br />
If a dll is registered I would just run the app, if the dll isn't registered I would register it on the usb stick without copying it to the system<br />
afterwards I would unregister it<br />
<br />
when I register it while it is registered on the system it will stop the program from working when it isn't running from usb stick.<br />
<br />
also, I don't always know the dll's that will be used so can't call any functions to test it.<br />
<br />
the only thing I will always know is the filename of the dll.<br />
is there a way of checking if it is registered?<br />
sorry for the difficult explanation ;)</div></div><hr />
