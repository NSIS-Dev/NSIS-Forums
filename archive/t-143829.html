<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know anything about SHLWAPI.DLL??? Do I have to do anything special to install it with my application...like UpgradeDll, etc...? I don't know why, but this DLL kind of scares me...I think because I don't know anything about it. Thanks in advance!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 04:07</div></div><div class="posttext">That file is a 'Shell Light-weight Utility Library' and seems to be a standard windows dll, at least in Win2k.  If your program requires it you should probably use the UpgradeDLL function although I think it might be already on most target machines anyway.  (Not sure about Win9x and old versions of NT)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd August 2003, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">According to a quick seach in Google SHLWAPI.DLL is not present on Windows 95 and NT 4 that don't have Internet Explorer 4.0 and above. As this DLL is part of Internet Explorer I doubt you can install it alone. You should therefore require the user to have Internet Explorer 4.0 installed if SHLWAPI.DLL can not be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">2nd August 2003, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, kichik. I will add that to my installer. So, are you suggesting that I look at the Windows version, and if it's NT4 or 95 then check the IE version, and if it's &lt; 4.0 then pop the message? Or, would you suggest just checking on all Windows version for IE &lt; 4.0?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">3rd August 2003, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I suggest you check if SHLWAPI.DLL is present and tell the user to install IE4 or above if not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">3rd August 2003, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that makes sense. Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />
