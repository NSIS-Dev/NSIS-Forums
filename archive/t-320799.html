<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrisAster</div><div class="date">14th July 2010, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to display an image on the left side of my custom dialog in much the way the standard welcome or finish dialog shows where the image is completely flush with the left-hand side.  As it displays now it is obeying the margin for the controls so it is inset a bit.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to get the image to display further left than using &quot;0&quot; as the starting X position in a custom dialog control (EX:  ${NSD_CreateBitmap} 0 0 200 250 &quot;&quot;) so that it's flushed to the left?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrisAster</div><div class="date">14th July 2010, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks jpderuiter. I think I found a way that I like a bit better, though. I found it in one of the samples for nsDialogs. I noticed that one of the samples has the Welcome page just as I would like it and in doing some experimentation I found out what the difference between their page and mine was:<br />
 <br />
Most dialogs use this:<br />
nsDialogs::Create /NOUNLOAD 1018<br />
 <br />
But the dialog where the text / image is flushed (ie without the margins) is specified like this:<br />
nsDialogs::Create /NOUNLOAD 1044<br />
 <br />
Perhaps this is documented somewhere, but I have not been able to find it. I hope if anyone else needs this info they can find this thread. Thanks again for your help.<br />
 <br />
Kris,</div></div><hr />
