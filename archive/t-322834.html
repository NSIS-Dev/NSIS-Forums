<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">1st October 2010, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to figure out what the best practice would be to split a struct into its substructs/data.<br />
<br />
E.g. say I have a struct in $0 that looks like this:<br />
(NMHDR, dwFlags, RECT)<br />
<br />
I can pass $0 directly to a macro / function / copy/paste bit of code to handle NMHDR.  But let's say I have a similar macro / function /copy/paste bit of code to handle RECTs.. but I can't pass i t $0 because it's got the NMHDR and dwSomething in front.<br />
<br />
I could be hacky and offset $0 by the size of NMHDR+dwSomething, but I'd imagine that may be architecture-specific and, well, hacky.<br />
<br />
But what would be the best practice?  Put the relevant bits on the stack, pop into a newly allocated struct, free that struct when done?<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
System::Call &quot;*$0(i, i, i, i, i.s, i.s, i.s, i.s)&quot; /* presuming I don't care about nmhdr/dwFlags */<br />
System::Alloc &quot;*(is, is, is, is).r1&quot;<br />
[parse the RECT struct in $1 now]<br />
System::Free $1<br />
<br />
<br />
Or is there a more appropriate method?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">1st October 2010, 07:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, a offset would be architecture-specific (32 and 64 bit, and 64bit NSIS, well, lets get unicode merged first)<br />
<br />
But when you do System::Call &quot;*$0(i, i, i, i... , this is actually the same as a offset and would not work as a native 64 bit app. When 2.47 comes out, you would be able to use p tho.<br />
<br />
You could add a helper macro: !macro GetStructMemberPtr_NMHDR::RECT in_baseptr outvar_adjustedptr (You might want a shorter name ;) and NMHDR is probably not the correct name, you are probably working with the listview specific struct or something like that)<br />
<br />
...or just a define for the offset. You could have a macro that created struct offset defines:<br />
!macro CreateStructOffsetDefine symname p i32 i16 i8<br />
ex !insertmacro CreateStructOffsetDefine NMLVDISPINFO::LVITEM 2 1 0 0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">1st October 2010, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">But would I then use that defined offset in exactly the hacky manner that I mentioned? :o<br />
<br />
Right now I&quot;m using the out-to-stack, create-from-stack, destroy-creation method, but if the hacky method is every bit as valid, I'd happily use that instead %)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">1st October 2010, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but with a define, it is in a header somewhere and you can use !ifdef NSIS_WIN64 when the time comes ;)<br />
<br />
But like I said, when 2.47 comes out, you can use p and then system::call *$x(... will work without hacks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">1st October 2010, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, of course with a define :)<br />
(or rather, multiple defines.. defining the offsets within structs for other structs)<br />
<br />
I'll have to await the details of 2.47 and how p kicks in here :)</div></div><hr />
