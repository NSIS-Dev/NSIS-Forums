<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mwiseman</div><div class="date">9th November 2004, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to run an executable using nsExec. The run  always ends in an error that indicates an executable-related error. <br />
<br />
nsExec::ExecToLog '&quot;myapp.exe&quot;'<br />
<br />
I can run the same executable using Exec without a problem.<br />
<br />
Exec '&quot;myapp.exe&quot;'<br />
<br />
Thinking that the environment may be the issue, I've tried:<br />
<br />
nsExec::ExecToLog '&lt;path_to_cmd.exe&gt; /C &quot;myapp.exe&quot;'<br />
<br />
to no avail. This problem seems to point to differences in how nsExec and Exec work but I don't know what they are. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Mike</div></div><hr />

As far as i know it doesn't support live output as used by programs like rar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">9th November 2004, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Something like this should work:<br />
<br />
<br />
!define LogFile &quot;$INSTDIR\myapp_dump.txt&quot;<br />
Push $R0<br />
 ReadEnvStr $R0 COMSPEC<br />
 nsExec::Exec '$R0 /C &quot;$INSTDIR\myapp.exe&quot; &gt; &quot;${LogFile}&quot;'<br />
 FileOpen $R0 &quot;${LogFile}&quot; r<br />
  LoopRead:<br />
   ClearErrors<br />
   FileRead $R0 $R1<br />
    IfErrors LoopDone<br />
    Push $R1<br />
     Call TrimNewLines<br />
    Pop $R1<br />
   DetailPrint $R1<br />
   Goto LoopRead<br />
  LoopDone:<br />
 FileClose $R0<br />
Pop $R0<br />
SetDetailsPrint none<br />
 Delete &quot;${LogFile}&quot;<br />
SetDetailsPrint both<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be another method of capturing the output.<br />
Note that nsExec::Exec will run your application and hide it completely from the user (so the user will not see a command-prompt window.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mwiseman</div><div class="date">10th November 2004, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the script but this doesn't really answer my question. I'm not looking for more error output from the nsExec run. The 'nsExec::ExecToLog' does write the errors to the result window. My question is: why would *any* command line program run to completion using:<br />
<br />
Exec '&quot;myapp.exe&quot;'<br />
<br />
but fail using:<br />
<br />
nsExec::ExecToLog '&quot;myapp.exe&quot;'<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be more specific now: the app I'm trying to run is Microsoft's Baseline Security Analyzer utility: mbsacli.exe. The error I get seem to be network-related - 'no computer were found'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">10th November 2004, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as nsExec doesn't execute your program through COMSPEC then perhaps that's why it is failing. Maybe you have to run it through COMSPEC for it to work?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">10th November 2004, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Windows MS DOS (console) window is a bit more complex then a process with stdin and stdout only. Simple console applications work fine with nsExec, but some apps require more - terminal emulation or something else (like telnet does). This may be a reason, Exec creates full MS DOS console window, but nsExec simply redirects IO to pipes. You can also try ExecWait with SW_HIDE.</div></div><hr />

does execwait support window state parameters like SW_HIDE ?<br />
<br />
from the nsis docs:<br />
command [user_var(exit code)]<br />
<br />
as i need to run a cmd-program in a loop, i need to get the installer wait until it has finished, but also to execute it in the backround without popping up the shell window everytime.<br />
<br />
does nsExec::Exec do this, or is it possible to use SW_HIDE with ExecWait?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you are right, I probably had in mind ExecShell. IMHO one of DOS-exec plug-ins is a good decision in your situation.</div></div><hr />

Can you attach a complete example for which you get the error you're talking about?</div></div><hr />
