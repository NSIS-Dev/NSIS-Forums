<br />
if u can create different reg keys at different points during the installation which show what has been installed so far, then also make the installer boot up on next reboot, and check those registry values to see which part you're up to and continue from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr Inches</div><div class="date">28th November 2006, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Resume functionality could be done I guess, if CABSetup can assume that if the target file exists it can skip extracting it a second time.<br />
<br />
If this is all that is required, it should not be too hard to do; I will look into it.<br />
