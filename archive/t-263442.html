again, I need your help, from anyone out there<br />
currently Im using UMUI<br />
and you can see from the attachment, I dont know how to change the 'centre' part (the one circled in red)<br />
I used UMUI_HEADERIMAGE_BMP  bmp_file to change the header bitmap image, and UMUI_LEFTIMAGE_BMP  bmp_file to change the left image. but I didnt found anything related on how to change the part that I want to change in the UMUI documentation.<br />
Hope anyone could help me.<br />
Thank you very much in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">18th January 2007, 04:19</div></div><div class="posttext">...And what exactly do you want to change within this part of the dialog? As I can see this is the welcome dialog regarding to the MUI, and your red square is around the welcome title and welcome text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takeshi</div><div class="date">18th January 2007, 05:28</div></div><div class="posttext">what i mean is, i want to put an image background<br />
right now I dont know the way how.<br />
i just can change the image header and left image only<br />
while the area with the red square is remained with background color, not an image<br />
i hope u got what i mean</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">18th January 2007, 06:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I know nothing about UMUI, probably you should add your request on UMUI related forum thread, but, as I mentioned above, regarding to MUI there are 2 static controls (labels) inside your red square that are responsible to display the welcome  title and the welcome text.<br />
First read the mui documentation about welcome title and welcome text, and how one could be able to modify the welcome/finish pages, later decide if you really want to modify them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takeshi</div><div class="date">18th January 2007, 07:52</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, thank you anyway Red Wine<br />
yeah, there is not much example about UMUI I can get<br />
most are for the MUI or classic</div></div><hr />
