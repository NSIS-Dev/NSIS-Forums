<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jakc</div><div class="date">18th September 2011, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been looking at related posts and also hunting about with google.<br />
<br />
For my software product (web application) clients will need to request a license from us before installing it.<br />
<br />
We would need to check if they are a paying client (a manual process at the moment).<br />
I need the ability for one of the initial steps of my installer to be let user request license via a custom page in the NSIS installer.<br />
They would put in some mandatory fields and then this would get fired off in an email.<br />
Ideally, NSIS would let them know that the email had successfully been sent.<br />
<br />
They would then exit the wizard, but when we verify who they are and send them a serial, they can run installer again, and there would be an option to enter the serial, allowing them to progress to the next screen.<br />
<br />
It is the emailing bit that I am currently stumped on.<br />
I have not seen any plugins to do this.<br />
<br />
What would be the best plan of attack to achieve this?<br />
<br />
A rough mockup  (https://cacoo.com/diagrams/76bVHnXFPWXUNb3b#21189)of what I imagine this custom page would look like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot use HTTP POST instead? This would be easy to do with inetc::post (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in#post_DLL_Function) in NSIS!<br />
<br />
It should be easy to pass the info to a PHP script on the server via HTTP POST.<br />

We dont have anything at the server end to store the POST operation in.<br />
But appreciate your efforts.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">18th September 2011, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be trivial to make the server script save the request.<br />
<br />
You can, for example, make the server script save a simple text file for each request.<br />
<br />
It can save the requests on a network share, e.g. on some machine you have direct access to.<br />
<br />
Or you can even make the server script emit an e-mail, if you insist ;)<br />
