<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beau</div><div class="date">6th December 2007, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I'm still fairly new to the NSIS installer, just looking for some help with scripting.  Basically I want to download an inventory text file which has a list of further files to download.  The theory is we can then simply update the inventory file on the server and not have to redeploy the setup.  <br />
<br />
The inventory file contains a file list in the following format:<br />
<br />
filename1.jpg=images^filename2.jpg=images^data.xml=data<br />
<br />
so that we have filename followed by the folder it should go into seperated by ^ characters.<br />
<br />
The above would end up looking like this on the system:<br />
<br />
images<br />
|-filename1.jpg<br />
|-filename2.jpg<br />
<br />
data<br />
|-data.xml<br />
<br />
If that makes sense.  I would be really helpful if someone could help me out with an example script.  From what I have read it looks like it should be possible I am just struggling with the scripting a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pospec</div><div class="date">6th December 2007, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you could use InetLoad plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InetLoad_plug-in) to download your &quot;inventory file&quot;.<br />
Then you will parse it, for examle using FileRead instruction. Look into Appendix E in documentation for advanced parsing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beau</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 00:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't suppose anyone could help with an example of how to parse the file as explained above?  Help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 01:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Talking about a plain text file, you should use the FileRead instruction as already mentioned.<br />
Nevertheless you have several options, e.g an .ini which you may read with ReadINIStr instruction or a .cfg which you may read with ConfigRead.<br />
Exclusively the file could be an xml which you may manage with one of the available xml plugins.<br />
There are several examples for every case, you should search the forum and of course review the documentation.</div></div><hr />
