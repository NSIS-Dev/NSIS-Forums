<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the NSISdl plugin automatically connect to the internet via ras or does the user have to connect to it manually. What about a request function which detects if an internet connection is already established? How can I connect to the internet within an NSI script? I know there are the API calls InternetAutodial and RASDial? Could you implement these in NSISdl?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out diallerdll.zip at the archive download page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/download.php).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konrad</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your answer. But the dialerdll link statically to the Internet Explorer Function. Not everyone has got an MS IE 4 or above. You should also add the possibility to dial over the RAS. Because RAS is also not installed on every machine, it should be dynamically linked. What happens if a user runs a NSI script,  and the plug-in dll cannot be loaded, because of missing DLLs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then I guess like the author of that plugin you'll have to write your own or persuade someone else to do so for you. I very much doubt such capabilities will be added to NSIS directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th February 2003, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Internet* functions were used because they are a lot more simpler than RAS functions. Please add a feature request to SF so it won't be forgotten. For now you can use IfErrors to find out if the plug-in loaded or not. If it wasn't loaded try to download and if it can't download tell the user to connect to the internet and try again.</div></div><hr />

I will perhaps write a plugin with RAS functions for NSIS. I will then post it to the archive.</div></div><hr />
