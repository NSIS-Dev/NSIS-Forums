<br />
I currently have an application which has been released as version 1.0 and have an upgrade coming soon. I was wondering how to best go about this.<br />
<br />
Firstly I know I can simply set the right overwrite options when copying the files and it checks the existing file(s) versions and then decides whether to update or not. I have also seen previous posts on the forums which explain how I can change the installer to show &quot;Upgrade&quot; text if it detects and existing install and how to not write another entry in &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; if it already has been<br />
installed.<br />
<br />
What I also need to do is to make changes to the database which the application uses. So if a previous version has been installed I need to drop some columns, create new tables etc. in the existing database.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to how I can best go about this?<br />
<br />
Should I simply execute an Upgrade.exe program (which I write) at the end of the install and let it do the work?<br />
<br />
Can I run a command line program (which I write) and execute it as part of the setup?<br />
<br />
Or, if version 1.0 is detected as having been already installed, I install an upgrade.exe file in the application's directory. Let the install end as normal, and just have code in my application.exe which looks for this upgrade.exe and runs it?<br />
<br />
Any tips, suggestions as to how other go about doing a database upgrade to an existing installed application would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Diego</div></div><hr />
