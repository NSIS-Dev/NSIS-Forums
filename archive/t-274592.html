<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">19th July 2007, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I am trying to show a custom page while i'm searching the registry for a value. But i can't seem to work out how to do it.<br />
<br />
I was thinking something like the code below might do, but i cant seem to work it out. It just wants to stop at the custom page so the user has to click next before the search begins.<br />
<br />
<br />
${Do}<br />
  ; Display the page from ini file extracted onInitialisation (look at function .onInit for files)<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY &quot;searching&quot;<br />
${LoopUntil} $R1 == 0<br />
<br />
<br />
I basically thought, because the handle ($R1) becomes 0 once the search has finished, i could use that to tell the page to stop displaying because the search has finished. No luck<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
You probably want to display a banner using the Banner plug-in.<br />

<br />
So does there have to be a page for it to display in front of?<br />
Or does it only work in Sections?<br />
<br />
I cant work out how to have it displaying while i'm searching the registry. Is there any more detailed examples apart from the wiki and in the plugin zip?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">19th July 2007, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">You call the plugin to display the banner, search the registry, and then destroy the banner when that is finished. As I have already said, you cannot display an InstallOptions dialog while doing something else, unless you write a plugin using a separate thread at the same time and then use ExecuteCodeSegment when that thread has finished to call a NSIS function.<br />
<br />
You can use the banner plugin anywhere where run-time code is executed.<br />
