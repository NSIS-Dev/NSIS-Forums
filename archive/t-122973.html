Is that possible with NSIS?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">That really depends on the application you are trying to close. Some will close when you send their main window WM_CLOSE such as Winamp 1 and 2 for example:<br />
<br />
loop:<br />
  FindWindow $0 &quot;Winamp v1.x&quot;<br />
  IntCmp $0 0 startCopy<br />
  SendMessage $0 ${WM_CLOSE} 0 0<br />
  Sleep 100<br />
  Goto loop<br />
<br />
Services need a special API call (ControlService). You can use the NET command line utility for services.<br />
<br />
Other applications might be waiting for a file to close, or for them to finish their task.<br />
<br />
The first method usually works, but you'll still have to be a bit more specific to get an absolute answer. If it's your application then you should know best what makes it close. If it's a VB application or any other wizard programming language then the first method should work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robdal</div><div class="date">28th January 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">This is, I guess, the most simple example of closing a running window. The following script will terminate notepad.<br />
<br />
SilentInstall silent<br />
OutFile &quot;CloseNotepad.exe&quot;<br />
Section &quot;MySection&quot;<br />
  FindWindow $0 &quot;Notepad&quot;<br />
  SendMessage $0 16 0 0<br />
SectionEnd</div></div><hr />

I want to kill any running internet explorer processes so that I can install a browser dependant program. seems IE is running in the background in some cases, and I need to end these processes before I can register my dll or I get an error when upgrading the dll.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Hope someone can help.:(<br />
<br />
thanks in advance :D</div></div><hr />
