<br />
I'm hoping some of you have maybe run into this before. I'm trying to package up an application I've written, and it has a dependency on another package which is being distributed solely in the MSM format. I think other installers (like the VB and Visual Studio ones) just natively know what to do with an MSM file. Well... I didn't see anything in the documentation regarding MSM files. Or maybe I'm just being dim, and the file just needs to be 'executed' somehow or aomething. Any thoughts?<br />

A search on Google didn't tell me anything helpful. You don't perchance mean MSI do you? (wotsit.org didn't know what it is either)<br />
<br />
okay they are MSI merge modules, now I know what they are I'll have a look see if I can help...<br />
<br />
Well I found this (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/msi/merg_2rhv.asp) but it's not particularly useful... good luck, I've got too much to do to chase this any further I'm afraid</div></div><hr />

NSIS doesn't work with MSI, as you have might already noticed :)<br />
I would suggest you build a simple, quite, MSI file that just includes your MSM file and launch it (just use ExecWait) from within your NSIS installer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole reason I'm using NSIS in the first place is because I don't have access to the VB or Visual dev studio to get access to their installer programs. And because I'd rather not support M$ given choice, which NSIS happily gives me.:cool:<br />
<br />
Anyways .... I'm going to try to contact the .... hmm ... I just had a thought. I *do* have access to an MSI file for that program. Excellent idea. Well... thanks all!<br />

ExecWait 'msiexec /i blah.msm /qn'<br />
That'll silently installit.  Of course this'll only work on systems that have msiexec installed ;)</div></div><hr />
