<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">winman2004</div><div class="date">25th October 2013, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">For my software for during reinstall and update of s/w i need o check whether files related to my software is open before replacing it with new one. So if the file is in open then i copy latest file with another name and was using Rename /rebootok so that the file is renamed during reboot.<br />
<br />
But in some server they dont restart the server as it works 24*7. In that case how i can do renaming etc. So rebootok does not help in this case. So what can be done?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forgot to mention that i am planning to do it.Renaming the file when it is open is allowed for some files such as exe files.So i can rename the file and replace that file. But in case of pdf files it does not allow to rename also. So what is the solution for this cases?</div></div><hr />
