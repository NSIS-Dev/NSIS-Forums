Well first of all a big round of applause for NSIS.<br />
Secondly, an applause for me as i managed to convince my management to use NSIS against InstallShield :D .<br />
<br />
We are in the process of designing an installer to deploy our web application along with tomcat. <br />
I have managed to get a hang of most of the things except one (so far ;-)). Here it goes...<br />
<br />
1. Welcome page click Next<br />
2. Page 2 click next<br />
3. Page 3 is a dummy information page which shows the progress of the tomcat installation with back, next and cancel buttons disabled.<br />
Now i would like that as soon as the installation is complete, &quot;Next&quot; button should be enabled automatically.<br />
Somehow i cant manage to find a way to enable the next button.<br />
<br />
My Questions:<br />
1. Is it possible using my approach?<br />
2. Is there a better way in use or someone is aware of?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope this helps<br />

<br />
I am already doing something similar. As soon as the user goes from page 2 to page 3 (the tomcat installation page), the next, back and cancel buttons are shown disabled with the tomcat installer being run in the background using the<br />
ExecWait tomcatsetup.exe /S /D=&quot;blah&quot;<br />
My problem is that once the installation is complete i would like to enable the next button.<br />
<br />
Hope i am able to make myself a bit clear now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crisp</div><div class="date">17th September 2004, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't you use the banner plugin (see contrib\banner) to notify the user of the progress of the tomcat installer ?<br />
I use the banner plugin to show my users that a database upgrade is beeing run silent.<br />
The procedure is someting like:<br />
 - Hide installer window<br />
 - show banner <br />
 - ExecWait the program silent<br />
 - After the program finishes then <br />
 - Hide Banner<br />
 - Show installer window<br />
 - Display error messages (if any)<br />
<br />
I'll have to check if your solution is usable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aadya</div><div class="date">17th September 2004, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Crisp...but unfortunately i had already found the solution. <br />
Your solution is more elegant though... perhaps i will incorporate the changes if i have some time in the end.<br />
BTW, do you have any idea on accessing sql server from nsis? I have a post based on an issue i am facing. Would you be kind enough to read it and reply please?</div></div><hr />
