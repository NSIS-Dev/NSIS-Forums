<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">6th November 2001, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think so, as I mention in the readme I'm using a few commercial controls so unless you also have them you're not going to be able to build it. So it's not that I mind if people had a copy it's just that they probably won't be able to do much with it.<br />
<br />
I think the ones I'm currently using are:<br />
<br />
DBISAM - functions and code snippets tables (could probably get it working without it if I tried)<br />
<br />
1st Class - status bar (I could use the standard one with a bit of additional coding)<br />
<br />
Infopower - function/code snippet grids (swapping back to the standard dbGrid works just not as neat)<br />
<br />
Dream Memo - script editor (provide the syntax highlighting, option completion, code templates and more so is difficult to replace although replacing it with a memo and commenting out all the thing that it doesn't support and making a few other changes would give you a basic editor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prodangle</div><div class="date">6th November 2001, 23:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again mckeeley, you have no idea how much the scroll wheel thing being fixed will help me :)<br />
<br />
Love the new XP icons too... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">6th November 2001, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">That's OK, the new grid control I've used improves on he standard one quite a bit, makes the EXE a bit biiger though, but you cn't have everything. <br />
<br />
A few of the tool buttons could do with a tidy up, uppercase/lowercase/Toggle Case/Capitalise (or ize), for next time. Actually typing that line in reminds me I want to make the spelling  English, rather than American English, if your regional setting is UK.<br />

Great news! ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for such a nice GUI.  It's the first one to come along that I've actually considered using!<br />
<br />
Couple of ideas tho...<br />
<br />
How about having the path to makensis defaulted from the registry instead of hard-coded to C:?  I know it should only ever need setting once, but it's those finishing touches that make all the difference.<br />
<br />
Been playing with the syntax scheme settings and found a bug (well, probably just a limitation in the library) - I tried to use a background colour other than white for the main text (sorry, I'm a bit funny like that :)), the background isn't filled with the desired colour.<br />
<br />
Desktop icons in a wizard-created script - the Delete in the uninstall section is indented incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Um, can't find anything else wrong with it :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">7th November 2001, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad you like it and thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
Yes, I should really work out the locations of MAKENSIS and SPLASH.<br />
<br />
I can set the background colours OK here. Here are the exact steps I used:<br />
<br />
Tools, Edit Syntax Schemes <br />
Clciked on 2. Comments page<br />
Clicked Edit button<br />
Unchecked &quot;Use Default Background&quot;<br />
Selected new background colour<br />
Clicked OK to close that dialog<br />
Clicked OK (on the left) to close the schemes dialog.<br />
<br />
Now I have green on yellow comments, just what I always wanted!<br />
<br />
I'll check the generated code from uninstalling the desktop icon.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">7th November 2001, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah...  but what I'm doing is changing the setting for Plain Text on the Common page.  I'd like it to use that colour for the whole script window, not just the extents of the lines displayed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">7th November 2001, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, as you found out the common section is the colour to use for text other than the comments, keywords... you have defined, not the &quot;paper&quot; colour. I'll see if I can add a paper colour option to the options screen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lion King</div><div class="date">7th November 2001, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">7th November 2001, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I've added an option to display things in British English, it doesn't auto-detect anymore you have to set it. The spelling changes come in to effect the next time you run the program.<br />
<br />
I've also added an option allowing you to set the script editors background colour. At the moment you'll also have to change your syntax scheme elements background colours to match or text will still display with a white background. If I can work out how to change the schemes backgrounds as well before I release it I will (although it's not exactly hard work to change them manually as there aren't that many).<br />
<br />
I'll probably be releasing it sometime over the weekend. <br />
