<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe NSIS needs to wake up! There is a fantastic team over there that has at least two fantastic products (NSIS and WinAmp) But I feel that NSIS lacks one thing.....one simple thing that Winamp does so well....Skins! <br />
<br />
I think The NSIS Installer should acquire the support for skinning!  <br />
<br />
(I'm going to try and post this as a poll.....) <br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Whether it's a compile time only or runtime only, both would be nice.<br />
<br />
For example: <br />
  Compile time, read in an skin.ini file that applys the skin to the installer, which overrides modern.exe's default look.<br />
<br />
  Runtime looks for a skin.ini residing in the same directory as the executable and applies it to modern.exe at runtime.<br />
<br />
Great way to brand an installer for a specific client without having to rebuild your installer, for each branding. Build once, apply many skins....sweet.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">mmm, I don't think.... normally a Installer is ment to be run once...<br />
<br />
But that would be cool, also meaning increasing header source code.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the main reasons is I'd be able to supply different graphics for different companies and different languages. Right now you cant specify a different MUI_HEADER_BITMAP or any other MUI image based on language without writing script to change the image constantly. Right now you have to rebuild if you want to use a different look and feel, instead of just applying a skin.<br />
<br />
I do agree a plugin would be nice, that way those that don't want to use it don't have to have the overhead.<br />
<br />
NSIS can be used for more then installers. I saw a whole database application that fully integrated with sql server, and it was written completely with nsis. I even saw a a game that was written in NSIS using standard mui dialogs for configuration etc, and using a custom dialog (modified modern.exe) that contained a directx active x control to host the graphical portion. So there's absolutely no way that anyone can say NSIS is only used for installers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VegetaSan</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">that would be great..... Iam planning to make some plugins .. but need to learn some C++ first ;) <br />
<br />
** reading a book about it ** (at page 11 .. only 658 to go)<br />
<br />
maybe I can improve it someday :PP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'd write one, seeing as I know C....I'll have the time soon too. Unfortunately, I've never done anything in regards to skinning. Anyone know of any decent FREE tutorials or books? C, C++, C# preferred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">3rd September 2004, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">if u've got problems with the mui settings, why don't u simply write your own define system?<br />
e.g. you got this in your installer:<br />
!define MUI_HEADER_IMAGE_BITMAP &quot;example.bmp&quot;<br />
i'd do this one:<br />
!define skin exampleskin<br />
!define MUI_HEADER_IMAGE_BITMAP &quot;${skin}\header.bmp&quot;<br />
now do so with all image/color defines u're using in your script, and u just need to set 3 defines at the very beginning of your script:<br />
!define SkinPath &quot;somehow\somewhere&quot;<br />
!define PrimColor A1B2C3<br />
!define SecColor D4E5F6<br />
with these 3 defines, u can now set all the look and feel of your installer:<br />
!define MUI_ICON &quot;${SkinPath}\Icon.ico&quot;<br />
!define MUI_UNICON &quot;${SkinPath}\unIcon.ico&quot;<br />
!define MUI_HEADERIMAGE<br />
!define MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP &quot;${SkinPath}\Header.bmp&quot;<br />
!define MUI_HEADERIMAGE_UNBITMAP &quot;${SkinPath}\unHeader.bmp&quot;<br />
!define MUI_BGCOLOR &quot;${SecColor}&quot;<br />
!define MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP &quot;${SkinPath}\WelcomeFinish.bmp&quot;<br />
!define MUI_UNWELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP &quot;${SkinPath}\unWelcomeFinish.bmp&quot;<br />
!define MUI_LICENSEPAGE_BGCOLOR &quot;${SecColor}&quot;<br />
!define MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_CHECKBITMAP &quot;${SkinPath}\Checks.bmp&quot;<br />
!define MUI_INSTFILESPAGE_COLORS &quot;${PrimColor}&quot; &quot;${SecColor}&quot;<br />
anymore questions?<br />
<br />
ok, few things, that won't be set:<br />
- the settings<br />
- what images should be used<br />
- the RTL settings<br />
- the welcome/finish INI settings<br />
- the description lookout of the components-page<br />
- the ressource-file settings<br />
- the autoclose and abortwarning settings<br />
<br />
so, now the second REAL skin method:<br />
1. !define all settings in one header-file (.nsh) per skin<br />
2. !include the headerfile of the skin you want to use<br />
3. finished. you now have a real skin-system<br />
<br />
extension:<br />
1. create a new subdirectory for every skin, e.g.:<br />
&quot;C:\mynsisprojects\skintest\skins\skin1&quot; and<br />
&quot;C:\mynsisprojects\skintest\skins\skin2&quot;<br />
2. copy all images for the skin &quot;skin1&quot; into the first directory, for &quot;skin2&quot; into the second ...<br />
3. copy the headerfile with defines from the second skin system to the subdirectory and rename it to &quot;settings.nsh&quot;<br />
4. use this inside your script:<br />
!define Skin &quot;skin1&quot;<br />
!include &quot;.\skins\${Skin}&quot;<br />
<br />
now, i think, you can do skins without plugins, and without increasing the overhead of our installers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">3rd September 2004, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's better to do the core first, then think of the options later...<br />
<br />
But, are you planning of doing support for a fixed theme or a dynamic one which can be changed everytime I call this plugin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I haven't decided if I'm even going to attempt it. It would definately increase the &quot;cool factor&quot;. Not to mention give NSIS one more &quot;up&quot; on the competition which don't let you chnage hardly anything. The MSI stuff in .Net 2005 looks pretty interesting though....</div></div><hr />
