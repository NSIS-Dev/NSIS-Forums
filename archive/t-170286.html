<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhonnysparks</div><div class="date">21st February 2004, 03:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys I'm prety new to nsis. I was just wondering:<br />
Is it possible to have a &quot;Select All&quot; and a &quot;Select None&quot; button on ur components page? Or would I have to create a custom page to do so?<br />
Also with WriteRegStr is it possible for me to write a dword value? If not how do I register a .reg?<br />
With creating a custom page, how could I put the components there? And would I be able to have a preview image (an image would appear when u hovered over than component, sort of like the description on the components page but with an image)? Thanx heaps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it possible to have a &quot;Select All&quot; and a &quot;Select None&quot; button on ur components page?<br />
<br />
No, you'll have to make a Page with installoptions and add the select-all button.<br />
<br />
Also with WriteRegStr is it possible for me to write a dword value? If not how do I register a .reg?<br />
<br />
Look for the instruction WriteRegDWORD<br />
<br />
With creating a custom page, how could I put the components there?<br />
<br />
With InstallOptions use the Checkbox and Labels to emulate the components page.<br />
<br />
And would I be able to have a preview image (an image would appear when u hovered over than component, sort of like the description on the components page but with an image)? <br />
<br />
I don't know if that's possible in the current versions of Nsis and InstallOptions. I think you'll have to re-write the plugin.<br />
Hope it helps! :)</div></div><hr />

Turns out I don't need the registry function but it's good to know :D<br />

Hmm I was afraid of that, that would be a bit of a pain seeing I have around 68 components :rolleyes:<br />

Hmm not quite sure if I'm up to that, oh well.<br />

<br />

<br />
Oh and one other question, I'm trying to use the get parent function but am failing miserably :(, could someone help me?<br />
<br />
Thanx again in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read the manual about InstType<br />
<br />
I'm trying to use the get parent function but am failing miserably , could someone help me?<br />
<br />
What get parent function? Directory or Installer Window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhonnysparks</div><div class="date">22nd February 2004, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the installer one. I'm trying to use this (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/AppendixB.html#B.1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">22nd February 2004, 00:36</div></div><div class="posttext">See a test code from the function?<br />
What errors you got?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhonnysparks</div><div class="date">22nd February 2004, 01:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx that cleared alot up. I got it working now :D<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">22nd February 2004, 02:25</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem dude! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhonnysparks</div><div class="date">22nd February 2004, 03:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry me again. I've noticed this bug in my installer: when you choose another location for installation it automatically adds the original subdirectory, e.g. if your default location is &quot;C:\Program Files\My Prog&quot; and then you click browse and select &quot;C:\Windows&quot;, it'll put &quot;C:\Windows\My Prog&quot;.<br />
<br />
One other thing: how do u make it so if one section is selected another must be required?<br />
<br />
Thanx again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's part of the installer system. I don't know how but I think is cool to have this option.<br />

<br />
See makensis.nsi example, there's an example of this.</div></div><hr />
