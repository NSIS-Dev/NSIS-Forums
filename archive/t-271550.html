<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vc6</div><div class="date">21st May 2007, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday I encountered for the first time since I started using NSIS 9 months ago (back then I started with 2.0, now 2.27) the weirdest problem ever:<br />
<br />
The script compiles and prepares a setup package EXE file without any problems, warnings or errors.<br />
<br />
It even installs perfectly on several Windows XP professional machines.<br />
<br />
However... on one, single, Windows XP Professional machine (PII 350MHz 512MB), it:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Reports progress as normal.<br />
 Reports successful completion.<br />
 The installed software shows up in Control Panel's &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; as installed the way it should be.<br />
 But... when I go to C:\Program Files folder, I find nothing there. That is, the INSTDIR folder that needs to be created (including all files in it) are simply not there. If I try to create a folder manually there, it is created (i.e. no permission or access problem).<br />
[/list=1] <br />
This does not happen on other machines, so clearly that machine is the problematic one.<br />
<br />
But this (problematic) machine is a FRESH INSTALL. What could possibly be wrong in a Windows XP Pro machine?<br />
<br />
I even re-installed the entire OS on that machine (it's a test machine, I can afford doing so), but that didn't cure this weird behavior.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen anything like this?<br />
Any idea what could make NSIS sensitive to apparently some misconfiguration of an XP machine?<br />
<br />
Any tip or insight would be very much appreciated as I ran out of ides.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
Victor</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found the source for the mystery: That machine has two HDDs: C and D.<br />
<br />
XP is installed on the D: drive.<br />
So $PROGRAMFILES points to D:\Program Files\.<br />
And I was looking under C:\Program Files\.<br />
<br />
I could swear that when Windows installs on any driver, even if it's not the master, it somehow maps it to C:\ by default. I must have been dreaming since Microsoft changed that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all is well now - and at least documented for posterity in thsi forum. :p <br />
<br />
Thank you all for listening!<br />

damn microsoft.  <br />
How is this microsofts fault? Maybe its a dual boot system, or some app has hardcoded c:, but unless you changed it, programfiles will be on the %systemdrive%</div></div><hr />
