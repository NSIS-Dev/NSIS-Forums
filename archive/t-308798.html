I will summarize my problem like this.<br />
I have developed a pidgin plugin for both linux and windows flat forms.<br />
Now I can package my program to a windows installer setup ( exe ) file and it works fine in windows.<br />
Now my problem is that this plugin uses Bonjour so If I install the plugin on a windows machine which Bonjour has not installed Bonjour then the plugin does not loaded to pidgin. its not working.<br />
Therefore when I install the plugin I need to check whether the Bonjour Windows toolkit has already installed on the machine and if so no problem.<br />
Otherwise If Bonjour toolkit is not installed then I need the installer wizard to prompt to install Bonjour windows toolkit setup from my plugin installation and the start plugin installation.<br />
In this case I think I need to bundle both plugin installer and Bonjour toolkit installer into a single installation pack. But I have no idea how to do that.<br />
<br />
Is this the idle way to handle this situation. If its then how to pack two installers to a single pack?<br />
<br />
I used cross compilation and used nsis to create windows installer for my pidgin plugin.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Nuwan</div></div><hr />
