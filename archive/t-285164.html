<br />
I have been researching NSIS (and WiX) for the past two days, and i am heavily leaning toward NSIS.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to find documentation on modularizing an installer.<br />
<br />
That is:<br />
if i have 6 components that need to be installed over several different pieces of software, I would like to be able to break apart (into different files) each of the components and their installation steps, and then include these components in the software NSIS script.<br />
<br />
ie.<br />
Components (in different files): A,B,C,D,E,F<br />
Software_1 includes: A,B,D<br />
Software_2 includes: D,E,F<br />
etc..<br />
<br />
Can i do this with NSIS?<br />
<br />
thank you for your support<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">18th January 2008, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS sections are similar to InstallShield components. You can break your project up into sections or groups of sections, and let the user select them or put logic into your installer and enable/disable sections based upon dependencies you define.<br />
<br />
Read the manual ( here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter2.html#2.3.3) and here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.6) )  to learn about the Section commands.<br />

<br />
I understand that the user can select multiple components during the install if each of these components is described in its own Section.  What I want to do, is have my main script include sections from other files.<br />
<br />
It looks like i can define a Section in an nsh file... and include that in an nsi file.  The Section is then selectable as a component.  Is this an acceptable practice?  Or is there some other method i should use to include an &quot;installable component&quot; in to my main product installer?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">19th January 2008, 00:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can do it with nsh header files. As for being an 'acceptable practice', I suppose that is up to you or your company. I don't see a problem with it.<br />
<br />
If the installation of those components is complicated, then creating reusable headers is probably a good thing, as it puts the code into a single location instead of duplicating it for each installer that will be using it.<br />
