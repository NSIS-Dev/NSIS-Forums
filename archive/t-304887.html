<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spilly</div><div class="date">1st April 2009, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys,<br />
I tried to use {NSD_OnClick} with a Text Box: {NSD_CreateText}, but it's not supported. If I use {NSD_OnChange}, it works without a problem.<br />
<br />
Basically, I want to clear the default text I have in the text box as soon as the user clicks it. <br />
<br />
Is this a bug or not added by design?</div></div><hr />

There is one work-around, but you may not like it very much - but I've had to use it for a different reason* and it works fine.<br />
<br />
1. start a timer when your page displays<br />
2. in the timer's callback function, use..<br />
System::Call &quot;user32::GetFocus(v) i.r0&quot;<br />
..to get the hwnd of the control that currently has focus.<br />
3. compare that hwnd to the previous hwnd (so you'll need to store that in a temporary variable somewhere).<br />
4.1 IF the previous hwnd was NOT your edit control (Pop'd after our create it, so pop that to a variable as well).<br />
4.2 AND IF the current hwnd IS your edit control<br />
5. Use ${NSD_SetText} YourTexthwnd &quot;&quot; to clear your edit control's content.<br />
<br />
You can easily set the timer to run every, say, 250ms and users will typically not notice that it's a delayed action; otherwise, drop down to 100ms.. doesn't hurt as bad as you might think.<br />
<br />
* The way I use this is to test a value entered in an Edit control only -after- the control loses focus, instead of every OnChange (the test can take a few seconds to run, which is annoying if it happens for every letter changed).  I start a timer using an OnChange callback, which I later kill when focus is removed from the Edit control (so that it is not running unnecessarily).</div></div><hr />
