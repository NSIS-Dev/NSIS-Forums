<br />
Basically I have this bit of code in my .oninit function:<br />
<br />
System::Call 'user32::GetWindowDC(i $HWNDPARENT) i .r0'<br />
System::Call 'gdi32::GetDeviceCaps(i $0, i 12) i .r1'<br />
<br />
to tell what the color mode running is.  Is there a way to get my images that are displayed in the installer to change based on this information?  I'm using Modern UI.  I don't think there is, since it seems like the images are added on compile, but if there is a way, it would be great to know it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">27th December 2005, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">there is, by api functions.<br />
LoadPicture and maybe some other functions should do it.<br />
<br />
browse the msdn :)<br />
<br />
there are also some threads in the forums where ppl discussed about setting pictures dynamically i think.<br />
<br />
the search button is your friend :)</div></div><hr />

Unfortinatly I don't know how to use APIs well enough to write the line of code.  The MSDN does have lots of code examples, but again me not being able to write an API I'm stuck :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">you need to do this:<br />
<br />
- load a picture using its filename, get the handle<br />
- get the handle of the control you want to change (&quot;GetDlgItem&quot; NSIS function)<br />
- assign the picture to your control, using both handles<br />
<br />
you just need to find the right functions at msdn :)<br />
<br />
then if you don't know how to implement them, have a look at the system plugin readme, you need the command System.dll::Call ....</div></div><hr />
