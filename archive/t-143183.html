Why not, instead of the zip file, make a compiled exe of NSIS?<br />
This in latest dev snapshot...<br />
Will be easy to install....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunny2k2</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">you cannot do that unless they make a Linux version NSIS andthe makensisw.exe and make the !InstallNSIS.bat into a !InstallNSIS.sh file for linux to auto execute<br />
<br />
Files Hosted on SourceForge which inturn is Hosted/Based on Unix/Linux :P<br />
<br />
or if SoruceForge was running Wine/Winex maybe ( doubt it as it only emulates a few Windows stuff properly) they could maybe do it<br />
<br />
as i imagine that they are having the Server Side doing nightly zipped to automate things<br />
<br />
as if someone was doing it manualy then yes they could but thats annoying that they would have to always be uploading the file everynight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dick4</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't the &quot;update&quot; button on the NSIS menu effectively do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunny2k2</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the update button downloads the CVS version and merges the changes and updates to ur copy of NSIS but u have to have NSIS installed anyway or u at least have to have the NSIS nightly.zip extracted and on ur pc.<br />
<br />
Update button = NSISUpdate.exe in NSIS\Bin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I post this because...<br />
most of us, don't need the source code...<br />
that could speed up the download...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The source code is included in the installer too, downloading an installer won't speed up anything. SourceForge servers run Linux, don't have Wine and prohibit compiling, so this is a no go.</div></div><hr />
