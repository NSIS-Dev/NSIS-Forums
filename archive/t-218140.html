<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">6th June 2005, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">A new NSIS plugin released incl. source and examples<br />
Name: MoreInfo<br />
Keywords: Version info, Multilanguage demo, OS GUI Language<br />
<br />
Goal of MoreInfo<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
The goal of the MoreInfo NSIS Plugin is to CORRECTLY retreive version information from files AND to retreive the Windows OS User interface Language!<br />
<br />
MoreInfo gives a complete valid NSIS Language define as an output. This can be any Language defined and supported by NSIS and even some that are not recognized by Windows. (It is not necessary that the host system actually support the locale with fonts, keyboard mappings, and so on.) <br />
<br />
The theory is that if the user can use the PC, he sure will be able to read the userinterface language.<br />
<br />
This way we avoid asking the user for a installation language to use, and is the installer GUI presented in the same language as the Windows OS User interface Language.<br />
<br />
The current way of retreiving a Locale setting was not satisfying enough since a user could have an English Windows OS and set is locale to e.g. France, the installer would be presented in French this way, although the GUI language was English. <br />
<br />
Just try it, you will see what advantage it can give.<br />
<br />
History<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
A NSIS plugin called FileInfo sadly gave unexpected results on various Windows OS's. This is how More Info was born... I needed correct information in all cases. And I also needed the OS GUI language.<br />
<br />
Since Windows has NO API to get the OS GUI language, I created this solution myself. Maybe it can help you too.<br />
<br />
Feel free to comment and improve, I will respond if I have some time left ;)<br />

It does not show version info, if &quot;language&quot; property is set to &quot;language neutral&quot; in tested file.<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">22nd October 2005, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I did not see your post since I was bussy with other things than NSIS for a while. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wabiloo</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In an executable of mine, there is a user defined piece of information called &quot;Expected DB Version&quot; (with spaces)<br />
<br />
The following returns an empty $1<br />
<br />
MoreInfo::GetUserDefined &quot;${SOURCE_DIR}\ComposerWin32.exe&quot; &quot;Expected DB Version&quot;<br />
Pop $1<br />
MessageBox MB_OK &quot;DBVersion=$1&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this due to the spaces in the field name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">18th August 2006, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe you should try this:<br />

<br />
If you could send a link to the the .EXE file with the troublesome version resource file I'm willing to investigate and see if we could solve you issue. <br />

TIA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi onad,<br />
<br />
I hope you are still actively developing this plug-in?<br />
Because, I am (we are) looking for the MoreInfo plg-in, recompiled to work with Unicode NSIS.<br />
It would be really appreciated, as we are in need of a fair few plugins with Unicode NSIS support!<br />
<br />
Link to Unicode NSIS homepage: scratchpaper.com/home<br />
Link our project: portableapps.com/node/21879<br />
<br />
Thanx a lot, in advance !</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I tried the test scipt with kernel32.dll on my Windows 7 system it was able to display information about the DLL.</div></div><hr />
