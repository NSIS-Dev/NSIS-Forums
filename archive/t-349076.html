First of all I am new to NSIS. So anyways, I needed a blowfish encryption during install and had to decrypt it after. The code in application is using OpenSSL and works fine. However I couldnt manage to make either of blowfish plugins work with OpenSSL(I think because of init vector). So I decided to edit the code of Blowfish++ and adde opensslencrypt and openssldecrypt functions. I downloaded the sources and built them and all was fine until I tried the installer on other machine. On my machine the installer goes fine and calls blowfish::opensslencrypt/decrypt but on other machines it just seems to skip the call entirely. The prebuilt dll works fine everywhere but the one built by me does not, even without changing anything in it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

The dll was compiled with VS2012 and needed it's redist on a clean machine to use dependency dlls. Hope this will help someone.</div></div><hr />
