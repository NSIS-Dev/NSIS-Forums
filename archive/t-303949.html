<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nsnb</div><div class="date">9th March 2009, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">In .onInit I conditionally define a different value for D_MYGLOBDEF - to be used in both install and uninstall sections.<br />
<br />
The NSIS script compiles OK with D_MYGLOBDEF in .onInit - and seems to run fine both the installer and uninstaller (although I am not sure that I 100% tested the uninstaller).<br />
<br />
But in a recent code review I realized that I don't have a matching un.onInit... so I quickly added one, doing the same conditional !define trick as in .onInit.<br />
<br />
The NSIS compiler immediately yelled:<br />
&quot;!define: D_MYGLOBDEF&quot; already defined!<br />
Now I am confused: a !define in .OnInit is valid for uninstall sections as well? :confused:<br />
<br />
If so, can I rely on this, eliminating the need to to !define D_MYGLOBDEF in un.onInit for uninstall sections?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Thank you - you just confirmed my observation - and helped me discover a misconception in my attempt to conditionally !define in .onInit: a !define should not belong in a function in the first place... it's a compile time thing (duh!)</div></div><hr />
