<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sunlight112</div><div class="date">5th January 2007, 02:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some problems with my installer. I create my installer. All information about my installer, I must read from registry.<br />
The first time, I have written these information about my installer in registry such as vendor, product name, product version. <br />
<br />
These are information about my product which i create in registry<br />
Product<br />
  Vendor             banana<br />
  Product Name       test<br />
  Product Version    1.0<br />
<br />
After, I create my installer from these information. <br />
It means I must read these information about my product from registry into my installer such as &quot;INSTDIR= $PROGFILES\$productname&quot;. <br />
My installer is created successful. I run it and my application run well. <br />
When I uninstall my application, there are some problems happen in my installer. MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES still displays these files which I delete. My problems is here. After I uninstall my application, all icon on my desktop become like this myapplication.link or yahoo.link or mycomputer.lnk.... I also click START, in all programs, these files like WINRAR-&gt;WINRAR.lnk and these text files can not execute (at that time, I must install my window again :( ). I run my window this time, I announce that I lost file run32dll.exe.<br />
I think while I uninstall my application, my installer has delete these system files.<br />
I also have to check my code and I think I do not delete these  system files. <br />
Actually, I can not explain why it happen when I uninstall my application. Is it wrong in my code or I have some mistakes? <br />
If you used to see this problem, please help me!</div></div><hr />

The uninstaller is a separate process that the installer. If you set a variable in the installer, it won't be set in the uninstaller. You must also verify that the variables are properly initialized, especially when having such a dangerous delete command in there. If those are not set, you delete the entire HKLM\Software key!</div></div><hr />
