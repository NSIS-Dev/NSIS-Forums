<br />
I am looking to either extend some current DLL's or to simply create my own from scratch. Firstly is it possible/allowed to extend other peoples Plugins? Secondly how would one go about making (or extending) a plugin. I dont know what these plugin's are written in nor any kind of format that they should follow or use, so I basically know nothing about them, but I'm pretty certain that for my project I am going to need to get involved with this kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer!<br />
<br />

<br />
A basic plug-in skeleton in C, ASM and Delphi can be found in Examples\Plugin. The source code for all of the plug-ins distributed with NSIS come in the source code package (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nsis/nsis-2.28-src.tar.bz2?download).</div></div><hr />
