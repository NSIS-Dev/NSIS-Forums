<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">During installation of your application, is it the norm to copy your dll to a specific directory (like C:\Windows\System???) and register it there...or do people typically just copy the dll into your &quot;application directory&quot; (like C:\Program Files\myapp) and register it there? Thanks in advance!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">it's better to the System, it's the base dir where the apps<br />
call the controls OCXs and DLLs...<br />
But I think that<br />
is OK that you can register it <br />
from your $INSTDIR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on the DLL/OCX file. If it's a shared DLL file (like the VB/MFC run-time) you should put it in the System directory. DLL files for your application are usually stored in the application folder. <br />
<br />
If you are worried about compatibility issues or backwards compatibility of a DLL file, it's better to keep your own copy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was just not sure if people put their DLL's in the application folder or &quot;hide&quot; them in the system folder. I wasn't sure if there is a reason to not let your users see exactly what files your app is using or not. If the DLL is in your application folder, then they know what your app uses. If the DLL is in the system folder, then the user has no idea that your app uses it because they can't find it...easily. Is there any opinions on that???</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see why you should &quot;hide&quot; the files for the user. Any user who would want to know which files your application uses can easily check the dependencies. I also don't think there is any reason why the user should not know the filenames.</div></div><hr />
