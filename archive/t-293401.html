<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jkugler</div><div class="date">21st June 2008, 00:24</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I'm using NSIS, and as part of my install procedure, I'm installing another package via an NSIS installer (CopSSH, if you care).<br />
<br />
I know about the /S switch.  The problem is (as I determined by trying that at the prompt) is that it returns immediately.  I want to run some commands after CopSSH is installed, but I want to wait until it is finished.  If the CopSSH installer returns immediately and runs in the back ground, how will I know when it is done?<br />
<br />
I found a reference to using ExecWait (which I've used for other things), but if the installer returns right away, the parent installer will have nothing to &quot;wait for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get the installer to wait until it's done before it returns?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

if ExecWait does not do the trick, ask the CopSSH guys to fix their installer or try http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ExecWait_and_waiting_for_child_processes_with_Job_Objects</div></div><hr />

Thanks!  I'll probably use that.  When I run the CopSSH installer with /S, I noticed that the process list showed NSIS.exe running.  So, I don't know if that's standard procedure, or if NSIS.exe is what the image name usually is.</div></div><hr />
