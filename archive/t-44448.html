<br />
I noticed that Justin's cool little compression animation from ~1.1k is gone...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">13th March 2001, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The main reason is that &quot;datablock optimizations&quot; are off by default. &quot;datablock optimizations&quot; made compiling especially slow when adding large amounts of data, and then adding a lot of files. <br />
<br />
1.1o's datablock optimizer is a lot faster, and strings are optimized in their own block, so the whole thing works faster as well.<br />
<br />
I got rid of the nifty animation because I moved to using one deflate() call per file, instead of the blocking system of before (which is more efficient). I suppose I could make it use multiple deflates but without synchronization, in order to put the little animation back, but I think it's OK this way. :)<br />
