<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grahama</div><div class="date">7th October 2004, 00:26</div></div><div class="posttext">does anyone have an example of streaming audio [not a MOD] that streams an audio file [wma/mp3] from a remote server during installation ?  I went to un4seen's BassMOD site and they have the dll for this....I am just too new to implement it into my NSIS app..yet :)<br />
<br />
does anyone have any example code in NSIS on how to use this ?<br />
<br />
many thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
my NSIS installer downloads and then executes 12 meg Quicktime Installer.  Many of the users are dialup...so I guess I am looking at about 30 minutes to download and install.  Streaming an 8kbit audio file during this 'eternity'  would drastically help matters as the client is a record company and would love a 'radio station-like' audio file to stream for their users...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">9th October 2004, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Use System plugin. There has been an old topic talking about this, but it had so many posts that some people get confused there. So I'm going to post the BASS header file here (with fixes). The zip file contains an example to play MP3 files. Additionally you need to have:<br />
<br />
- BASS.dll - to use about all functions available in the header file.<br />
- BASSCD.dll (not required)- to use some functions to play/rip CD music.<br />
- BASSWMA.dll (not required)- to use some functions to play .wma files.<br />
- (Recommended - not required) documentation of each component above to know how to use the codes correctly.<br />
<br />
There is NO documentation, so you need to go inside the header file and understand it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grahama</div><div class="date">9th October 2004, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">do I need a specific verison of bass.dll?<br />
I downloaded version 2.0.0.23</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">9th October 2004, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you can use it with any recent version of BASS.dll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grahama</div><div class="date">10th October 2004, 03:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll try it in Win2k as it did not seem to be working in XP....I am using Virtual PC so the problem could lie there.<br />
The example in the folder  is for a local file. I can easily code the streaming of a local file :)   In my case, I need to stream a file from a server.  Is there an example of this...<br />
many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">10th October 2004, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I don't have one. But I know the commands said on the documentation which makes it possible:<br />
<br />
BASS_Init (Initializes an output device).<br />
BASS_StreamCreateURL (Stream of MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG or WAV file on the internet).<br />
BASS_StreamPreBuf (Pre-buffer initial sample data ready for playback of a stream).<br />
BASS_StreamPlay (Plays a stream).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grahama</div><div class="date">10th October 2004, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">great<br />
I'll give it a whirl and upon success...I'll post the example to the list.  I'm sure a lot of people have need of this kind of thing...keeping users  entertained during a download/install<br />
