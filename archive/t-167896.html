<br />
I'm doing a banner for my install program.<br />
I have it as a recomposing data display is there any way I can get it to display the Progress in percent. So like if it is set up to show for 5000ms how can I get it to show that in percent 0-100% Is there a certain command I can call?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />

If there are multiple commands, it might be possible to show a progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh one other thing - <br />
<br />
Is it possiable to Have a .MP3 file decoded to .WAV through the NSIS system. What I mean is, I have 5 files to put in my install that are very large in .WAV format, I converted them to .MP3 but on the users program they need to be .WAV so is there a way to make the install program decode them to .WAV when it is installed on the Destination computer?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">After searching for a freeware MP3 decoder and not having much luck I got another idea.<br />
<br />
You said that the reason you wanted mp3s was because they are a lot smaller that wavs. Then I thought of OGG Vorbis.<br />
Ogg Vorbis is a completely open, patent-free, professional audio encoding and streaming technology that sounds better than MP3  <br />
Now Ogg creates better quality and smaller files so it's perfectly suited.<br />
<br />
Simply encode your waves with &quot;oggenc2.exe my.wav&quot;  This will produce a my.ogg file which you then should include in the installer together with the oggdec.exe<br />
<br />
You can then extract these ogg files then run &quot;oggdec.exe my.ogg&quot; from the installer and you have your wave file back then you can simply delete the ogg files and oggdec.exe from the system and you are done.<br />
<br />

Encoder can be found here. (http://rarewares.hydrogenaudio.org/files/oggenc2.3-1.0.1.zip) <br />
Decoder can be found here. (http://rarewares.hydrogenaudio.org/files/oggdec1.0.1.zip)</div></div><hr />

That sounds great, It should work perfect, thankx for the help.<br />
<br />
I did some searching of my own I found a decoder for MP3 thats free to use from Etalon Software If you or any one needs a Decoder check this one out. Plus its free you can't beat that.<br />
<br />
MP3 Decode found here (http://www.etalonsoft.com/mp3decode.html)<br />

I'm using the EXEC command is this the wrong thing to use.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">use LAME for free mp3-en-/decoding.<br />
i think, it's open source, but am not sure.<br />
in any case, it's free.<br />
just google for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">DrkAngel I had found the decoder you specified, but you needed a command-line decoder NSIS could use.  I tried the OggDec.exe and got it to work with the following code  SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\Sound&quot;<br />
  file &quot;oggdec.exe&quot;<br />
  file &quot;test.ogg&quot;<br />
  file &quot;test2.ogg&quot;<br />
  execwait &quot;oggdec.exe test.ogg&quot;<br />
  execwait &quot;oggdec.exe test2.ogg&quot; <br />
If you did not want the dos boxes showing up during the decoding you could also use the nsExec plugin, but then you would lose the progress info.<br />

<br />
Ok I see where I made My mistake with the code. I also tried the nsExec::ExecToLog worked well also. Don't know wich I'll use for the Release but your help with this was much appreciated.That OGG :up: is a great tool.  :D<br />
<br />
Thanx again<br />
