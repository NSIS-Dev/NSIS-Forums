<br />
I had to support in my (un)installer, the silent feature which on WinXP worked just fine. I assume this would be used by administrators in companies to mass-(un)install the product on all the users computers.<br />
<br />
On Vista, on the other hand, because of the UAC, when uninstall.exe /S is called the &quot;consent prompt&quot; is shown, so the (un)install is not really silent anymore. Does anybody know how would an administrator of a company mass-deploy the software without user interaction?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Viv</div></div><hr />

The whole point of UAC is that thing can't be installed silently. However, administrators will know how to elevate processes and install batches of programs.<br />
<br />
To repeat: Don't worry, it's not your concern.</div></div><hr />
