<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just reading about the MAKI scripting language (http://www.winamp.com/nsdn/winamp3x/scripting/docs/overview.jhtml) used by WinAmp3 and thought &quot;hmm written by the same people as NSIS, wonder whether they'll ever make a version that uses the MAKI scripting engine&quot;.... a proper scripting language would be a godsend for NSIS but I guess I'll just have to continue dreaming (or else boost the scripting capabilities of NSIS myself sometime soon :D)</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmm, i wonder aboot you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">16th August 2002, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I think NSIS is great, but I know I'm not the only one who finds it's scripting language lacking. NSIS scripting looks somewhat akin to assembly language and the reason that most people use a higher level language like C/C++ or whatever is that writing in assembler is just too painful most of the time (and takes much more time and effort than using a higher level language). Adding script language features (such as for loops or named variables) wouldn't increase the size of an installer, just the size of the compiler. Therefore I think it's definitely something that should be considered (but it's admittedly not a priority :))</div></div><hr />

That would be very nice, but I think that there are other priorities now. :D Maybe for NSIS 3 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a thread about 6 or 8 months ago about someone who had (was going to?) replace the language NSIS used to have proper functions etc.  I thought this was a great idea.<br />
<br />
I suppose the current situation if it were to remain could be made a lot better by having a large library of common routines and not telling everyone to just modify 'x' to get 'y'.<br />
<br />
I really like NSIS and while I once wrote 2 meg of assembler source for a single program I can't be bothered and haven't got the time to code the NSIS routines I need and this is annoying.  The scripting language will be the reason I change from NSIS (if I do).<br />
<br />
My 2 cents worth.<br />
