<br />
I have been playing with nsisdl for a little bit now, but have been running into problems. Basically, I'd like to generate and install a unique key (from the server) for each download. I figured that the easiest way to do this would be to have the install process contact the server and download a file containing this key. This leads to my difficulties:<br />
<br />
It looks like the nsisdl cannot download a dynamic page (with server-side code, redirects, etc.). More specifically, it won't retrieve a *.cfm page (I'm using Cold Fusion) which outputs this key. Is this a known issue? Am I going about this the wrong way?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give. It's much appreciated.<br />

<br />
I was using a dynamic php script which was a build of lots of information for my program.<br />
<br />
Do you have a content header length code in your script?<br />

<br />
Thanks, I'll look into it a little more from that angle.<br />
