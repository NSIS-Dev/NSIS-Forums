<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">banaman8d</div><div class="date">13th June 2003, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I have included a script that simply copies files from one directory<br />
to another and registers dlls ocxs. It also creates a shortcut to itself to run in silent mode, but it is named to look like the application it installs.<br />
<br />
The idea is that when the user runs the program, they cause the program to automatically update itself from a mapped network drive, then launch - all silently.<br />
<br />
The problem is that I have used the Modern UI, and I create the shortcuts based on ${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE}. When the installer is run silently after the initial install, the regkey that holds the value of ${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE} gets clobbered so when the uninstall is run the startmenu shortcuts cannot be deleted.<br />
<br />
The ${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE} is read as a blank '' in the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
I have included the script here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">banaman8d</div><div class="date">13th June 2003, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">After taking a look in the Contrib/Modern UI/system.nsh, I think I have located the problem. The modern UI functions that read the registry key don't get called when the installer is run silenty, but if you are creating shortcuts like this:<br />
<br />
; This won't get called in a silent install<br />
; so MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE isn't set.<br />
; This is because it expands to a Page command<br />
; and these are skipped in a silent install.<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGECOMMAND_STARTMENU<br />
<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
<br />
; The Sections will always run<br />
Section<br />
...<br />
MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_BEGIN<br />
<br />
  ; This won't do what we expect in a silent install because<br />
  ; ${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE wasn't set.<br />
  CreateShortCut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE}\${MUI_PRODUCT}.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\${MUI_PRODUCT}.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_END<br />
...<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
The code inside is executed and the code that MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_END expands to writes the registry key. This means that you will write the shortcuts, AND the registry key will be clobbered if there was one already in the registry.<br />
<br />
To make the STARTMENUPAGE stuff work with silent installers as well as for a repair install (one where you already installed but want to install over it), the code to get the default folder should:<br />
<br />
1.) Assign the string in the regkey to MUI_STARTMENU_VARIABLE if it exists.<br />
2.) If it doesn't exist, assign the MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER to the MUI_STARTMENU_VARIABLE, (which will get written when the MUI_STARTMENU_WRITE_END is reached). And this code should be called before the Page commands are - not in the page command because they won't get called in a silent installer. This requirement makes .onInit a good choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To fix the problem, put this line into the .onInit function.<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_INIT<br />
<br />
<br />
and the corresponding macro is:<br />
<br />
!macro MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_INIT<br />
  ;Initialize MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE so it is set when we<br />
  ;are run silently, or as a repair (install over a previous).<br />
  Push $R0<br />
  ReadRegStr $R0 &quot;${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_REGISTRY_ROOT}&quot; \<br />
                 &quot;${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_REGISTRY_KEY}&quot;  \<br />
                 &quot;${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_REGISTRY_VALUENAME}&quot;<br />
  IfErrors +3<br />
  StrCpy ${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE} $R0<br />
  Goto +2<br />
<br />
  ; Get default if no regkey<br />
  StrCpy ${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_VARIABLE} \<br />
         &quot;${MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER}&quot;<br />
  Pop  $R0<br />
!macroend</div></div><hr />
