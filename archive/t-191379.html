<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">3DTrains</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 04:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a method for downloading files from a server using wildcard characters? And if so, how can these files be downloaded, installed, or copied to a specified directory on the user's PC?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to build an installer for a game, where the installer is similar to Afrow UK's ddayupdater. However, I hate to think I would need to hard code all the file names - especially since I'm creating new files almost on a daily basis (IIRC, I've passed the 2500 mark on the number of files). If I'm not mistaken, the ddayupdater probably downloads a data file and checks the user's directory to see what's needed, no?<br />
<br />
FWIW, I'm a commercial modeler, but the app and associated files are freeware. :)<br />
<br />
I've searched the forum, checked the techdocs, archive and looked through the NSIS Update for examples, but I haven't yet come accross anything matching my needs. TIA.</div></div><hr />

I had a php executable online that queried the D-Day site's map database, and generated a list of maps (txt file).<br />
D-Day Updater simply downloaded this list file which contained all the info such as bsp names, authors, file sizes, uploaded date etc.<br />
<br />
I used FileOpen, FileRead etc to read from the list, and wrote various string functions to get hold of the relevant data (each map data were stored on each line, seperated by pipe chars |)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">3DTrains</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks, Stu - without waiting, I modified an old perl script of mine that writes to a log file for downloading (I'm not well versed in PHP). The script's pretty basic - writing the name, size and date uploaded. I'll read through the docs on FileOpen/FileRead...If I run into a snag, I'll be back. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the assitance, Stu - much appreciated! :)</div></div><hr />
