<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pawel</div><div class="date">4th July 2008, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I am using in my NSIS script a custom pages created using InstallOptions plugin.<br />
Before the custom page is created and displayed I write to ini file some information, that this page using to display. There is one problem with it. Speed.<br />
One of my pages have a treeview component, that have a lot of items (about 700). I use languages in installer. So, to create a page I have to write to ini some informations depending on choosed interface language.<br />
Writing this values to ini tooks to long. Is there any way to speed it up? (I use ReserveFile).<br />
Is there any possibility to write data to memory? And then read it from there? Is there any plugin that<br />
can do it for me? (I mean a lot of text, ini file structure in memory).<br />
Thanks,<br />
-Pawel</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks, I am sure nsDialogs are much faster, but I have to store the data in some place. As I understand nsdialogs lets creating pages, but cant store for example items of treeview. <br />
To do it, I need to write/read from file with data (treeview is created by my own plugin) - and it is to slow.<br />
So, this is why I am thinking to use memory instead of ini files. But, how can I write to memory large blocks of data (with ini structure) and then read from there by plugin (and vice versa)... Don't know is it possibly.<br />

You could try my NSISList plugin now to store the items:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSISList_plug-in<br />
<br />
My test has shown that you can create 100 lists and add 10.000 strings to each list without problem. So you can store 1 million strings (maybe even more) entirely in memory with that plugin. I guess that should be enough for your tree view...</div></div><hr />
