<br />
This is a bit of a strange problem (and one not easily recreatable as it only happens on some machines). <br />
<br />
I have a fairly basic install script, which copies files, sets up some registry settings, and registers a few dll's (in that order).<br />
<br />
On some machines (very few so far but we've only just started field testing), so far this only seems to happen on XP machines. The dll's are not being registered. Previous forum articles seems to suggest dependancy problems may cause this, but i can manually install the dlls using regsvr32, which seems to indicate that they could be installed, but are not....<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly i didnt check the error flag (i will for the next build), so i dont know if the regdll command is failing or not.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any experience with this kind of problem.<br />
<br />
