<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">16th December 2001, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I was browsing the Nullsoft site and I saw ASS I/O. My question is, could NSIS use the ASS I/O program to split the installer?? Something like this:<br />
<br />
SplitInstaller [size in kb]<br />
<br />
After this function the MakeNSIS program would then create the .ass files (or make .nsis file) that NSIS would interpret. <br />
<br />
Just a thought though.<br />

<br />
maybe not tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcgarrah</div><div class="date">17th December 2001, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer might be to support diskette installs but with the cost of CD media being so low, I cannot see anyone using diskettes to distribute software.  AOL isn't giving disks away anymore. :)<br />
<br />
My install is small enough that I can fit on a single 1.44MB diskette if I want to use diskettes so I don't care yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">18th December 2001, 07:26</div></div><div class="posttext">This idea was 1) not created by me<br />
and 2) is something that would be great.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is that I am working on Linux Emulator for Win32 and a Linux OS that can read and execute from a FAT32 and NSFT partitions. For the Win32 emulator, I need an installer. This for my project admin, as I am the only win32 packager they have. We want NSIS, but we are making the OS big enough to put on 2 CDs.<br />
<br />
Hence my problem<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">18th December 2001, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoa if you are talking about a 1.2gb+ installer, you shouldn't be putting all of the files in the EXE anyway. How about storing some of the larger ones in the CD-ROM filesystem and using CopyFiles?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">18th December 2001, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">...yea this was my idea :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 01:15</div></div><div class="posttext">duane just wants to package his *warez* :) hahaha</div></div><hr />

True True, I don't know what my Project Admin is thinking, I will tell him, but I don't think he'll like it.<br />
<br />
Liquid-<br />
Yea!!!!<br />
<br />
Truth though, The we are waiting for confermation on a loan ... So That is why we are using the Free Installer. I am thinking about quitting because I am working for free ... I HATE IT!!! (But I love being the Admin of the NSIS Project House).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prodangle</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">One possible use could be to make it simpler for poor dial-uppers like myself to download biggish (20mb+) packages.  Whenever I am downloading some piece of shareware 20mb or more, sods law guarauntees that I'll get disconnected when I've downloaded 19mb of it, but only if it's coming from a non-resumable server, or if I've forgotten to use a resuming downloader.  It would make it simple to offer large installers as a set of smaller files for unfortunate dialup folks like myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trace</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">yea i`m a shitty little dialup-er 2.<br />
<br />
   happy holidays, make your all wishs come true :)<br />
<br />
cheers, trace ;)</div></div><hr />
