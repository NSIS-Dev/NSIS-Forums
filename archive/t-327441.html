<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Armatron</div><div class="date">16th February 2011, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I just shifted to include the Graphical Installer plugin in my installer, but I have a problem regarding buttons. I made a test with my code, and everything worked fine, except for a couple of warning messages. <br />
<br />
&quot;SkinnedControls error: T.&quot;<br />
and<br />
&quot;Color of button text has wrong format, check the GRAPHICAL_INSTALLER_BUTTONS_TEXT_COLOR and GRAPHICAL_INSTALLER_BUTTONS_TEXT_COLOR_DOWN defines.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have already checked those defines, and they seem fine. The custom .bmp for my buttons skin is size 47x45 px according to instructions, and I left the default text color for them (0xFFFFFF), but I still get those 2 error windows while running the installer.<br />
<br />
Also, I checked and tried the included examples, but they have the same problem. Has anybody had this same problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">T.Slappy</div><div class="date">17th February 2011, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.<br />
Solution is simple:<br />
If you use standard NSIS use Standard SkinnedControls plugin<br />
If you use UNICODE NSIS use Unicode SkinnedControls plugin.<br />
<br />
These plugins are available to download here from forum, but I also sent you a link.<br />
<br />
There are some problems related to Unicode NSIS - http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=326288 and thus SkinnedControls plugin has two versions: Unicode and NonUnicode.<br />
Mixing them with NSIS may result in this error.</div></div><hr />

When I pop-up a messagebox, the buttons on the UI become un-skinned again, so I have this ugly effect of unskinned buttons on a nice UMUI interface...<br />
I tried rerunning the plugin after the messagebox but apparently you can only run it on guiInit<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

This problem is related to SkinnedControls, UMUI or Graphical Installer does not affect it.<br />
I suppose that calling skinning method from plugin might work, but the plugin lacks of method for skinning single control.<br />
I will have a look on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found quick butdirty solution, which is a little hacky.<br />
SkinnedControls.dll and source is attached (non Unicode, converted to VS 2008)<br />
<br />
All you need is to call exactly this message always you want to redraw buttons.<br />
    SendMessage $HWNDPARENT ${WM_MENUDRAG} 0 0<br />
<br />
e.g.:<br />
MessageBox MB_OK &quot;This message causes SkinnedControls bug...&quot; ; ; After clicking OK the buttons lost their skin<br />
SendMessage $HWNDPARENT ${WM_MENUDRAG} 0 0 ; Force reskin<br />
<br />
I used WM_MENUDRAG message [which is normally unused] to notify window to put another refresh message into queue -&gt; to force redrawing. See the source code how it works.</div></div><hr />
