<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dazau</div><div class="date">17th October 2007, 00:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created an installation script for installing a custom dictionary into MS Word.  I want the script to add the dictionary (bislama.dic) for the current logged in user as their custom dictionary #2.<br />
<br />
Custom dictionary #1 &quot;custom.dic&quot; is the deault where all words that you click &quot;Add to Dictionary&quot; normally go to, so I made mine custom dictionary #2.<br />
<br />
While the script runs, and copies across the dictionary file and sets the registry entries, Word does not recognise the new words in the dictionary.<br />
<br />
If I manually add the dictionary in Word -&gt; Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Spelling and Grammar -&gt; Custom Dictionaries it works.<br />
<br />
I think my problem may be related to the location where I put the dictionary file.  I put my file (bislama.dic) into:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxuser\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Proof<br />
<br />
By using InstallDir $LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Proof<br />
<br />
Microsoft stores &quot;custom.dic&quot; into:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxuser\Application Data\Microsoft\Proof - note there is no &quot;Local Settings&quot; in that path.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I need to change $LOCALAPPDATA and not put it under &quot;Local Settings&quot; but store in same place as the MS custom.dic?<br />
<br />
Is there a tool that I can use to take a snapshot of the registry before and after I make the manual changes to see where I am going wrong?<br />
<br />
I have attached the script in case anyone can shed some light on this for me.</div></div><hr />

You should go to any M$ Office discussion (if there is any).<br />
For comparing the registry keys use &quot;Export to .reg file&quot; and compare the REGs (e.g. in WinMerge).</div></div><hr />
