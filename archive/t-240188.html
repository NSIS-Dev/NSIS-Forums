<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coco_vc</div><div class="date">7th March 2006, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw the samples from the Library.nsi. Those are dll/lib related. But in case I need something similar for an .exe, how can I do that?<br />
I mean when the user runs the setup and the product is already installed and the application is running, how can I _update_ the files in use (exes, libs and dlls) without requesting the user to close the app but asking for a reboot at the end of the update?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />

<br />
However, if it's an executable, you can have your setup kill the process by sending WM_CLOSE to the window, or something similar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will try using the library macros on exes too.<br />
<br />
Thx for the tip about sending WM_CLOSE to my app, problem is that my app for now depends on some external lib that is having a bug which makes sometimes my app to react very-very slow to a WM_CLOSE. As I anyhow have in the system a dll that is in use by all socket applications so this one needs to be updated via a reboot I would preffer not to even try to kill myapp (as this would mean wait until it reacts), but do the update/delete of the exes over reboot too.<br />
<br />
Do you see any problems about this behaviour?<br />
Thx,<br />
Viv</div></div><hr />
