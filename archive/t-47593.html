<br />
1. I really need access to the the environment in general and specifically the &quot;COMSPEC&quot; at this time. I think COMSPEC is important enough to be able to access like other NSIS variables ($COMSPEC) - also a quick fix - please!<br />
<br />
2.It would be nice if all environment variables could be accessed either this way or in a similar manner to how registry reading is currently done.<br />
<br />
3. There is no horizontal scroller on the install window which means that I can't see anything to the right of where it gets chopped off....<br />
<br />
4. NSIS 2.1e (the latest I had yesterday) refuses to create a particular icon. Is there any error checking? From what I can see (in the bit of the progress not chopped off) it created OK (or at least NSIS thinks so). This is on Windows 2000.<br />
 <br />
Bye<br />
