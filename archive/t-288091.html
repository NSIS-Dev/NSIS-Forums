<br />
If I try to open it with Visual C++ 6.0 nothing happens.  <br />
<br />
I have installed NSIS on two different computers with the same results.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the NSIS array source, but I was hoping to start with the minimal and work up.  I only need to make one function.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just reused the other project file from Arrays and removed all the files and added the exdll files.  I was just afraid the project would be set to include libraries that I didn't need.  Been awhile since I did much of anything with C++</div></div><hr />

In the next version, this will be forced by the release script and Subversion.</div></div><hr />
