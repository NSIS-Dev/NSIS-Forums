<br />
Unable to log on:<br />
Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.<br />
<br />
I have verified that the username and password I am using are correct. I have also tried several admin accounts with the same failure message.  How do you get UAC to work?<br />

I joined but I have not used IRC before. How do I get the new build?  <br />
Maybe asking there: &quot;Hey guys, how can I get new build?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">29th February 2008, 03:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like there was a problem with running the installer from a remote share, I was able to reproduce the problem with the runas.exe NT utility. There is not much I can do to fix this, as far as I can tell, any share you can access as the NULL user will work, on shares where you login, it will not work since the new elevated user does not have the same access to that share where the .exe is</div></div><hr />
