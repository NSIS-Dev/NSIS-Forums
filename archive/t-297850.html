<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrroyce</div><div class="date">25th September 2008, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,  I've been reading forum posts and google listings for weeks and I still can't figure out why the Uninstaller for my script is created sometimes and not created at other times.  <br />
<br />
I'm struggling with understanding where the uninstall keys should be placed in the registry, so could it be related to using the following values for the registry?<br />
<br />
;Default installation folder<br />
InstallDir &quot;$APPDATA\Prism&quot; <br />
InstallDirRegKey HKCU &quot;Software\Prism&quot; &quot;Install_Dir&quot;<br />
...<br />
WriteRegStr HKCU &quot;Software\Prism&quot; &quot;Install_Dir&quot;  INSTDIR<br />
...<br />
 WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\${MUI_PRODUCT}&quot; &quot;DisplayName&quot; &quot;${MUI_PRODUCT} (remove only)&quot;<br />
<br />
When it is created, it is properly placed in the $INSTDIR but other times it just does not seem to be created.  <br />
<br />
I even did a search on the hard disk to see if the file was being placed in a different folder.  I do see a file called &quot;UNINSTALL.EXE-079433DA.pf&quot; being placed in the &quot;Windows/Prefetch&quot; folder.  Googling that folder name doesn't help any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to create the directory that stored the uninstall program before I executed the WriteUninstaller command??<br />
<br />
Not sure if that is the correct procedure, and it's not in any of the documentation, but it worked for me!</div></div><hr />
