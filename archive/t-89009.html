Here's the prob; when WA3 is minimized in the sys tray there is no window to close by NSIS it is only listed as a process in the task manager. I have used plenty of spy utilities to look for a window but none exist. Here's the question; is WA3 going to have a window when minimized in the SysTray later on, or is there a way to do this with the sdk, or should i wait for NSIS to be able to close a process?:confused: :winamp:</div></div><hr />

this is a crosspost and will be closed. The answer has been supplied in your other thread as you already have seen. Please be more patient next time and do not start similar threads.<br />
