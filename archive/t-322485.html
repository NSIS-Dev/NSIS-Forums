<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexxx</div><div class="date">17th September 2010, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">When my programm uninstalls it has to remove its' temporary files. There's a special folder where the files are placed, but it also has subfolders. So, when uninstaller calls RMDir, it starts printing all the files it deletes. I don't need it because there are many. And this printing causes Log window to scroll and make the uninstallation too long. I don't want that. I've already thought about changing RMDir to Delete &quot;*.*&quot;, but there are many subfolders, I don't want to walk manually over them. So I need to disable scrolling, or to make RMDir silent. Is there any way to achieve this?</div></div><hr />
