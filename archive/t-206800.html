<br />
This is what appears when i try to install ALLMOST ANY program.<br />
It doesnt appear on the ones that have a &quot;background&quot; when installing<br />
<br />
I'm Using Windows XP SP2, 5.01.2600 With all the updates from Windows Update<br />
<br />
What can i do?<br />
<br />
NOTE: The error message was translated so i don't know if it really looks like that!</div></div><hr />

Try running SFC. Go to Start-&gt;Run and type &quot;sfc /scannow&quot; (without the quotes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Art Crazy</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm it is asking me to get the windows CD to copy some .dll files, but my CD is in a place &quot;allmost unreachable&quot;, is there any other way?<br />
If not i'll have to get it...<br />
<br />
I can only get it at least tomorrow, cos the only ppl that are &quot;allowed&quot; to get it are my parents and they are busy</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Art Crazy</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I had tried to fix this by downloading the file from http://www.dll-files.com/ and tried to replace it, it wouldnt do it so i backed mine up and went to safe mode and replaced it there -- nothing was fixed...<br />
<br />
EDIT: I found out that the file is related to Outlook and i renamed it and am running the repair tool... lets see if it doesnt ask for the CD, as its in the same place as the one for Windows<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: Oh damn it asked me for the CD... I have bad luck!</div></div><hr />

http://www.computing.net/windowsxp/wwwboard/forum/126388.html<br />
See response #2<br />
<br />
And that refers to the fix...<br />

<br />
Edit: Oh you already found it, never mind :p<br />
Perhaps you should keep all your CD's in a special place like me :p<br />
