There are a couple of solutions: the first thought is that you can have a loop with FindWindow and Sleep if it is not there yet. To FindWindow you will need the window title and should have the window class. This could fail if you're not careful if, for example, the program has another copy running, or you have another program with the same title and class (explorer window open to the folder, etc). A second solution is to wait for the process to appear (look for FindProcess in the wiki to see how to do that). Third, maybe you are simply asking how to wait for the process to appear and finish, in which case ExecWait would work.<br />

pause the script until the exe's program window is shown<br />
<br />
FindWindow in a loop is the best bet.<br />
