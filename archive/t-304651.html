<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ronca</div><div class="date">26th March 2009, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">In one of the steps I need to unhide files (visible in their folder during install) then unhide them.<br />
<br />
I found a registry key that does that and it works but only if the user logs off and logs on again - which stop the execution of my installer.<br />
<br />
I noticed that in windows xp in folder options when you select hide/unhide and press the apply button this happen immediately without having to logoff/logon. How do they do that?<br />
<br />
Can I do something similar in NSIS?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ronca</div><div class="date">27th March 2009, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Anders for your advice. It is good in general but in my special case I need this for an internal company application.<br />
<br />
If I can't do this via NSIS I will have to find a way to do this via win32 API.<br />
<br />
I tried ${RefreshShellIcons} but this doesn't help.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Maybe instead of messing with the user's explorer settings,  you could simply change the file/folder attributes to remove and then set the &quot;hidden&quot; flag?<br />
<br />
My thought is that perhaps you could just use attrib.exe (which I believe is included with all Windows installation).  Or you might find a plugin or API call to do the same.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
:o  yes, SetFileAttributes should work. (Thanks Anders).  I knew I read that somewhere; go figure it'd be in the NSIS help file!</div></div><hr />
