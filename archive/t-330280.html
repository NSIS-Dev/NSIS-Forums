<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZZR Puig</div><div class="date">3rd May 2011, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just recently begun to develop installers and I'm trying to use UMUI on an installer I have previously completed, and I'm getting some odd compilation errors.<br />
<br />
I' have tried to test the UMUI examples to see what's wrong, but the examples also give the very same errors.<br />
!insertmacro: MUI_LANGUAGE<br />
!include: could not find: &quot;D:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\English.nsh&quot;<br />
Error in macro MUI_LANGUAGE on macroline 9<br />
Error in script &quot;E:\My Documents\Basic UMUI Example.nsi&quot; on line 42 -- aborting creation process<br />
<br />
In the  UMUI.nsh, within the MUI_LANGUAGE LANGUAGE macro, the line origin of the problem is this one: <br />
!include &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\${LANGUAGE}.nsh&quot;<br />
<br />
The folder &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\&quot; doesn't even exist. And trying to copy the folders &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Language files&quot; OR &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\UltraModernUI\Language files&quot; in its place just return errors elsewhere, as could be expected.<br />
<br />
I can't understand that the UMUI script cannot find the files of its own installation, and I haven't seen this kind of problem posted elsewhere, as it could be expected if it's a bug of the UMUI itself, which doesn't make sense either.<br />
<br />
Please, can you help me understanding what's happening and how can I solve this issue?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just trying to compile UMUI examples, it should be expected that their script is right, but the error that appear is the same as in my own script. So the problem must have its origin elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

You could try pm'ing SuperPat and point him at this thread. (Please make sure to post the solution in here, if you solve it through pm.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZZR Puig</div><div class="date">3rd May 2011, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I still have to do some work to configure UMUI properly it seems to work now.<br />
<br />
I'm far from knowing which was exactly the problem, but my guess is that the &quot;UMUI version 1.00b1&quot; I had installed was supposed to be based and compatible with MUI v1.67, but the MUI installed in my system was v1.8.<br />
<br />
The solution to the problem, which is what's really important and useful, has been to install a new UMUI (version 1.00b2) I got from this website: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UltraModernUI<br />
<br />
Hope it helps someone not to lose as much time as I did to find a solution to this problem.</div></div><hr />
