<br />
I noticed that if I add a custom include dir to the compiler, and include once a file that lives both in the NSIS include and the custom include, the compiler includes it twice :eek: !<br />
<br />
Is it a bug or a feature?</div></div><hr />

Well... I don't think it is right to consider a case like &quot;it's the user fault, never mind&quot;. This situation happened to me, and I just found that the compiler behaviour was strange<br />
<br />
IMHO the compiler should either emit a warning, or include only the standard include.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">1st March 2006, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I see your point.  But, consider that NSIS was purposfully designed to be as minimal as possible to cut down on on the overhead of the installation. <br />
<br />
To get around this type of thing, you'll notice that most of the !includes included with NSIS put their includes in an !ifdef/!ifndef block.  For example, if you have an include file a function 'foo', then the entire include file might be something like:<br />
<br />
!ifndef foo<br />
   !define foo<br />
   ...<br />
   [insert code here]<br />
   ...<br />
!endif<br />
<br />
This way, if the file gets included more than once, it's no  big deal since the compiler will ignore 2nd and subsequent calls to the same file.<br />
<br />
If this is still a change you feel strongly about, then you should add it as a suggestion on the  <br />
NSIS SourceForge page (https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis).</div></div><hr />
