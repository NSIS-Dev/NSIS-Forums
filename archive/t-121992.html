<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">19th January 2003, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The NSIS version I used more was 1.98, then I changed to v2.0a7 and using v2.0b0 now.<br />
<br />
I want to comment here that I feel uncomfortable with the new look&amp;feel of the documentation. Of course, it's more complete than the previous, but it doesn't fit me.<br />
<br />
This is a feeling I have for quite a long time. Today, I wanted information about getting the time stamp of a file. I clicked in &quot;file instructions&quot; and was not there. I searched for &quot;time&quot; and found that the desired information was in &quot;Registry, INI, File Instructions&quot;.<br />
<br />
This kind of things happen to me everytime. if I want info about &quot;Goto&quot; I have to use the search because I don't know if goto is a &quot;basic instruction&quot; a &quot;general purpose instruction&quot; or a &quot;flow instruction&quot; (now that I checked I see is a flow instruction, but I won't remember tomorrow because &quot;goto&quot; is kind of basic and general). The problem with searching is that goto is used in exemples and it takes a bit to find what you really want.<br />
<br />
Today I thought that having an alphabetical list of all instructions would work for me. We can include that list as another appendix, &quot;index of instructions&quot;, or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">19th January 2003, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have HTML Workshop, with which I can create HTML-based help-files. If people want it, like it and need it, I'm willing to make a help-file for NSIS, with keywords, index and search capabilities. Ofcourse, kichik, Sunjammer and joost verburg may include the source in the CVS and releases.<br />
<br />
Tell me if you like the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mistertea</div><div class="date">19th January 2003, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">What I liked most was the feature to search the page for a certain command. That's what I miss most now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kypec</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm missing the examples for the most of the instructions:<br />
I mean that SYNTAX + OPTIONS is not always understood by me, I'd<br />
like to see one or two real usage examples with short explanation<br />
of what the result of this/that usage will be :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaqDraco</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 08:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I fully agree. I can't understand why the list of instructions on top of the docs is gone. If i'm looking for the syntax of an instrauction the whole Chapter 3 must be searched.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdbarker</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The documentation system that is used to generate the NSIS documentation, Halibut, is capable of generating Win32 help files.  Perhaps those could be automagically generated and included instead of, or in addition to, the HTML docs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthompson</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">With the CVS Version of NSIS:<br />
Change &quot;config.but&quot; in NSISDIR\Docs\src to be:<br />
<br />
\title NSIS Users Manual<br />
\cfg{xhtml-leaf-level}{2}<br />
\cfg{xhtml-leaf-smallest-contents}{3}<br />
\cfg{xhtml-leaf-contains-contents}{true}<br />

\preamble NSIS is a free scriptable win32 installer/uninstaller system that doesn't suck and isn't huge.<br />

Then run the build.bat in NSISDIR\Docs\src.  It will produce a new html doc output that looks as follows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea. Would solve a lot of problems. And I didn't say that I don't have those problems, but since others already came up with the suggestions, why should I?</div></div><hr />
