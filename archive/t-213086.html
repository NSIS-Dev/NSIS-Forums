<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">13th April 2005, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">This seems like it would be very simple, but I can't seem to get it to work:<br />
<br />
I have a custom InstallOptions page that has 2 groups of 2 radio buttons (4 radio buttons total).  Each group is placed within it's own GroupBox control.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get the 2 groups to work independently--in other words, allow the user to pick one radio button from Group 1 and 1 radio button from group 2.  <br />
<br />
I know that I probably just need to use the GROUP flag in the InstallOptions INI but I can't seem to get it to work.  The InstallOptions help seems a little vague and I've been unable to find any good examples.<br />
<br />
Does someone out there perhaps have a small example of how to properly format the install options INI file?<br />
Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">13th April 2005, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm... that's what I thought, but so some reason, it's not working...<br />
<br />
Could this be a problem:<br />
Currently, I don't have both groups next to each other chonogoically.   For example, each set has 3 fields:  a groupbox and 2 radio buttons.  But I have each group in different places in the ini file.  (For example, group 1 is entered as fields 4-6 and group 2 is entered as fields 9-11.  I would assume that they don't need to be all together--am I wrong?<br />
<br />
Since I've got so much underlying code, it's hard to change the fields without breaking the main script.  Therefore, I'll try to create a &quot;scaled down&quot; example to see where it's actually breaking.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I'm open for any other suggestions!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

InstallOptions is a little bit limited when talkin' about groups. The &quot;GROUP&quot; flag should only be used near the end of the INI file. Why? It groups all controls after the control where it's used and the control itself.<br />
<br />
InstallOptions uses the simplest way from the developer side to group controls. Maybe I'll have a look on it in future releases of InstallOptionsEx, when I start implementing Tab controls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done some quick tests with a dummy install/installoptions.ini and of course it works!  :mad: <br />
<br />
I'll start on tweaking my install to move the 2 groups near the end as you suggested.<br />
<br />
Thanks to both for the help!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I found my problem.   (and a bonehead problem at that!)<br />
<br />
I was using a default installoptions.ini which I then modified using a special function inside my install.  I initially had the 2nd group disabled and then only enable it if I find user has option XYZ on their computer.<br />
<br />
The problem was that when toggling the enabled flag, I failed to include the GROUP flag!  <br />
(D'OH!)</div></div><hr />
