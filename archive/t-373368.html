<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ktdeveloper</div><div class="date">28th October 2013, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I am new to software development (though not programming). I am in the process of delivering my first application for commercial release, and I am in need of a single-click installer package. I looked into a number of solutions - I coded my own in C# (it basically just grabs my three folders to their respective destinations), but ran into some issues with bundling some IO libraries. I found NSIS, and while its tutorials are great, I still have some questions.<br />
<br />
I have three files<br />
<br />
1. myApplication2013 folder<br />
2. myApplication2014 folder<br />
3. System.Data.SQLite.dll<br />
<br />
The general logic of the installer is this: http://puu.sh/51YUE/3a143d80f9.png<br />
<br />
What the installer really does is it takes the source folders/files (from the 3 above) and literally copies them to the target location. This is also what my C# script does (though it uses the IO library). What are the steps I need to for NSIS?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

It embeds the files you want from your dev machine in the installer executable, and copies those files on the computer of the user.<br />

Thanks for the reply jpderuiter.<br />
<br />
Could you give me an example on how this works?<br />
<br />
For example, I'd like to copy all the files inside C:/Users/myName/Desktop/myApplication-2013/  into C:/ProgramData/Autodesk/REVIT/Autodesk2013/Addins, how would the script look? Is there also a way to do a conditional, that is, if myApplication-2013 doesn't exist, but myApplication-2014 exists, copy into myApplication-2014.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpderuiter</div><div class="date">29th October 2013, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want the destination folder fixed (user cannot change it), first callSetOutPath &quot;C:/ProgramData/Autodesk/REVIT/Autodesk2013/Addins&quot;<br />
Then call the File command:File &quot;C:/Users/myName/Desktop/myApplication-2013/*.*&quot;If you want to have a conditional destination directory, you can use LogicLib and SetOutPath: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/LogicLib<br />
<br />
However, looking at Revit addin deployment, copying the dll files seems to be not enough, you should also register the addin.<br />
Search google, it seems like some Revit Addin deployment tools are available which makes it easy to create an installer.</div></div><hr />
