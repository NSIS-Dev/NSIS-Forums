<br />
Are there any plans to clean up the code a bit?  I know Justin gives fair warning that the code looks like crap, but I feel it would help everyone if the code was easier to read.  By that I mean, the code could be neated up by putting standard whitespace indentions and adding a few comments.  <br />
<br />
By cleaning up the code, more people code figure out what is going on with it faster and thus there would probably be more updates/patches.  In the long run this makes for a better NSIS installer for us all!  So what do you think?  I would be glad to help in this process, but without the support from the major contributors it just isn't going to work.  <br />
