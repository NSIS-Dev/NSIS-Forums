<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eries</div><div class="date">29th October 2001, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I build an installer with thousands of files in it. I have noticed that on Win98 and ME, when a user clicks &quot;Show Details&quot; their install crawls to a near halt. I have looked into the code a bit, and it appears this is because Windows timer messages come much slower on Win9X, and since the copying of files is linked to these message events, the copying of files is consequently much slower.<br />
<br />
(To see that this is the case, you can run the install, let it grind to super slow mode, and then wave your mouse around the Show Details box. This speeds things up considerably, because you get more event messages when the mouse is moving)<br />
<br />
Has anyone managed to get a fix for this? As a potential workaround, is it possible to disable the Show Details button conditionally, as part of a label Goto?</div></div><hr />

It#s helps a lot if you move your Mouse constantly in the part of the screen where the detail out put is.<br />
<br />
I know this not a perfect solution but it helps on small - medium installation</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deep-Trouble mentioned a workaround here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=63564) , dunno if his idea would work properly, or maybe someone is already working on a way to fix it</div></div><hr />
