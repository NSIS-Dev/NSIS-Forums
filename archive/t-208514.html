<br />
If you want to give the user an option to not install paint.exe, you can put paint.exe in a section and add the components page. You can also create a custom page using InstallOptions. See Contrib\InstallOptions and Examples\Modern UI for examples.</div></div><hr />

I want to check if previous instance of application is active (in memory) and if it is active, <br />
then I want to popup a message : &quot;Installer will now close older version of this application&quot;. After <br />
that, I want to shutdown older version automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, so you want to close the old program, not to exclude from extracting it... That depends on your application. If it has a window, you can find that window using FindWindow and close it using a message such as WM_CLOSE. If it doesn't have a window, or won't respond to WM_CLOSE, then you'd have to figure out on your own how to close it. If you know how to close it, but don't know how to do it with a NSIS script, post the details and I'll help you to convert the method into a NSIS script.<br />
<br />
Some examples for using WM_CLOSE are:<br />

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=462<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=455<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=322<br />
<br />
There are also some plug-ins that allow you to terminate process by name, but that's not a good idea. To quote MSDN:Use it only in extreme circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exclude?</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">So, it walks about it me :). Only how employ for now for example, paint.exe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said, it depends on the application you're trying to quit. If sending it a WM_CLOSE doesn't work, provide more details about this &quot;paint.exe&quot; and then I might be able to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exclude?</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Is not possible it to establish program walk from mountain  about what or ? But that is wanted it, make in order to? Give what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">It's possible to find a process using on of the following:<br />

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=483<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=542<br />
<br />
The second one even allows you to kill a process. But as I've said in the previous reply, it's not a good idea.</div></div><hr />

You can change all of the texts in the images. The Modern UI readme (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Contrib/Modern%20UI/Readme.html) contains all the information you need for this.<br />
<br />
If by start logo you mean a splash screen, take a look at Contrib\Splash and Contrib\AdvSplash. If you mean the image on the left in the welcome and finish page, take a look at the MUI readme, it tells you how to do that.<br />
