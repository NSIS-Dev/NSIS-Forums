<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MichaelWithers</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been considering using NSIS as an installer for a product I have developed and iam unsure if I can achieve everything I need to achieve with NSIS.<br />
<br />
I have a software product that is basically a website and is about 400mb in size that needs to be installable from a CD and be able to run off the CD. This means putting all the website content onto the installer CD uncompressed in a convential file structure.  Because it needs to be installable I also need to have an installer that will just copy all the content from the CD to a location on a hard-drive and do basic tasks such as setting up the start menu short cuts etc. Having the ability to uninstall would also be desirable.<br />
<br />
Ive tried writing something simple in VB6 to take care of this, but getting such things as progress bars to work in VB6 seems to be a challenge and I feel the time would better be spent learning NSIS or a alternative that could cater for my needs!<br />
<br />
Thanks Guys<br />
<br />

<br />
you don't have to put the files inside the installer, There is a &quot;CopyFiles&quot; commando where you can easily  do the stuff you want to achieve. <br />
(In my installer I use this to copy demo data if available)<br />
<br />
The only problem is, that you have to set the progressbar manually  (as far as I know) because NSIS does it via the &quot;File&quot; command<br />
<br />
But this is also not such a big problem!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">{_trueparuex^}</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Progressbar moves along with any instruction inside sections, but if you have just one &quot;CopyFiles&quot; command with wildcards the progressbar will move just once. So you need to create serval &quot;CopyFiles&quot; to make the progressbar run smoothly. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks again Mike</div></div><hr />
