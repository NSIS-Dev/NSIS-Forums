<br />
I want to create nsis installation programs automatically by a batch script. This shall be done on a linux machine, there is no possibility to use a win32 system.<br />
<br />
Since I only have to run MakeNSIS and nothing else: Is there a linux version available for this tool?<br />
<br />
If not: I really would like to use NSIS but has anyone suggestions which other software can solve my problem?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Quape</div></div><hr />

<br />
Creating a Linux port of the compiler is also possible, but you will be some things you have to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">1. no, nsis doesnt run under linux, because it's an installer-engine, using the wqindows-api. and there's no linux-version.<br />
<br />
2. no, i don't know any other solution, but i must say, that i don't know any commercial installer, that don't create lot's of overhead in the installer-exe, wastes memory at install-time and creates lots of waste at the users system (registry, etc.)</div></div><hr />

I know. And I don't want to run NSIS but just MakeNSIS. It's only a packager, can't be so difficult to make that working.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Comm@nder21: You didn't understand the question, it's about creating win32 installers on Linux.<br />
<br />
It's definately possible. MakeNSIS should run fine using the WINE emulator.<br />
<br />
Previous NSIS 1 compilers have been ported to Linux. There is some code that should be changed, but it should not be that difficult to create a NSIS 2 compiler for Linux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, i understood the question.<br />
but i thougt, that nsis requires some windows-funcitons on compile-time.<br />
but u'll have to know, u wrote it ...<br />
i'm sorry for writing this shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there are probably a few things that have to be changed to port it to Linux, but not that many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jBabel</div><div class="date">10th January 2004, 05:27</div></div><div class="posttext">For the record, we had the same requirements, and I tried NSIS with the latest wine rpm (from wine's sourceforge) on redhat 9. I Copied my NSIS folder on the linux box, and it ran flawlessly on the first try. <br />
<br />
There are some gotchas because of the different filesystems, but running makensis from the script's directory should get around most of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">10th January 2004, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">i was wondering about something similiar for osx. it doesnt even need to be a compiler, but something that checks the syntax of the code. i'd love to code nsis on my laptop when lying in bed :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quape</div><div class="date">12th January 2004, 13:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried Wine and that worked without problems. Yes, GREAT! I can now create NSIS installer executables by just running &quot;wine /c/programs/NSIS/makensis.exe file.nsi&quot; (or similar)<br />
<br />
Maybe a linux version of makensis would be nice to have in the future but it's not much important for me now.<br />
<br />
So, my problem is solved, thanks guys!<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
