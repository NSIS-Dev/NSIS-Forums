<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MindlessOath</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">im interested in using this dll to play Mod's, XM's, and S3m's<br />
http://www.un4seen.com/<br />
spacifically bassmod 1.6<br />
http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html#stuff<br />
it uses a dll called BASSMOD.dll <br />
<br />
how do i go about loading that dll up and calling it to play my music in the NSIS install?  i just want it to start the music and loop until closed the application.<br />
<br />
im not really a great programmer with all this stuff. i did a search and all it came up with is playing music with bgimage or whatever... and that was only for WAV files :(<br />
can anyone help me out? i posted a topic at the forums at the other location, but im sure i need more help from your guys end of things.<br />
<br />
im sure i can find out what functions need to be called when needed, but how would i integreat that into NSIS script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently working on a NSIS plugin for playing OGG files and possibly later MP3s.  I have not come across the formats you listed before therefore I'm not certain of how this dll works but a starting point would be to get the list of exported funtions and their c prototypes so that they can be called using the system plugin.<br />
<br />
Vytautas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MindlessOath</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 00:00</div></div><div class="posttext">just to let you know...<br />
http://www.un4seen.com/<br />
has a dll that will play mp3's ogg's and etc.. aswell.. they have source code for it i belive in vb, c++, and probably delphi.<br />
<br />
hope that helps you out. <br />
<br />
ok.. so once i know these functions.. how do i implement them into the NSIS scrip??? im a total noob at NSIS right at the moment.. i know only basic functions and whatever is in the help file. <br />
<br />
anyone know how i go about implimenting these functions and such from a dll to play music?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, mp3s/oggs are kinda against the nature of lean installers (that applies to downloadable files of course). but tracker formats would definitely be cool :)<br />
<br />
however, i'd be interested to know, if your dll (Vytautas) can play the files looped (gapless?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MindlessOath</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">ya thats what i was thinking.. why use mp3, wav, ogg, or other HUGE music files??? unless you install is huge already than a 3MB file added wont make much of a differnce, but using tracker music would be great... like mod's and XM's etc.  www.modcentral.com i belive will clue you in on some of the music their. or is it www.modplug.com - ya thats it.<br />
<br />
they are idea cause they are only kilobytes in size, and their for dont take up much at all space, problem is, not many applications or programmers know how to impliment tracker playing in applications.  but some do, and thats where we get these dll's etc.  hopefully someone could impliment this trackers support. i have seen one installer that provides support using this.... but i dont like it as much as NSIS, to much bloat if ya ask me.  <br />
<br />
i just went searching through the archive.. and it looks like IM not going to be able to program this function into my scripts at all.. so if someone could do this for me (and many many others) it would be greatly appreciated!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 01:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you convert wav file to mod files?<br />
<br />
You see the main reason for the plugin was also the ability to compress wave file into ogg format for distribution and the decode them during setup.  As a added functionality, since the decoding engine is already in the plugin I will add the ability to play the files aswell.<br />
<br />
Looped play is in the todo list, very close to the top of it actually.  Will most likely be in the first release.<br />
<br />
Also thanks for the link I will check out their code and see if I can improve on mine :D <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MindlessOath</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 06:17</div></div><div class="posttext">well all i ask is when trying to improve on your script... try and add the MOD play support if at all possible.<br />
<br />
i do belive Mod's can be converted into any format.. usually mp3, probably wav and most likely if it can go in either or of those two.. it can get into ogg format.<br />
<br />
a MOD is basically a buncha really small wav file samlples played in a list that tunes the tones up and down to make music. its very advanced, and its REAL MUSIC since you HAVE to compose it.  thats what makes it so unique.  and thats what makes it so small too.</div></div><hr />

And not all definitions are needed, only the ones used.<br />
<br />
the only thing I want to do is make a checkbox loop or randomize playlist, but the second option will be difficult because bassmod doesn't support playlists.<br />
<br />
This is my second day on the forum, and I never thought that people actually would be using my code :rolleyes:<br />

<br />
i dont see why you would want to put buttons and such for the music. i think all that is neccisary is a volume bar, mabe a stop/start button, hrm.. selection of files is pritty awesome, but i would only include that fucnction with large install files, like big games, or large distrabutions. :P<br />
<br />
listening to mods right now, i love the sounds, music to my ears, none of that radio BS i hear now adays. &quot;F MTV&quot; MODS RULE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apollo51</div><div class="date">6th March 2004, 10:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I basicly wanted to do something like the ware guys from MYTH like: http://www.apollo51.demon.nl/nsis/Worms3D.Installer.MYTH.zip<br />
<br />
this one will probably be a Delphi/C application that unpacks the bassmod.dll as RCDATA and plays the mod files from memory as RCDATA (compiled within the exe)<br />
<br />
I did it too in Delphi, but I like NSIS much more!<br />
<br />
Yes, tracker music is cool, it reminders me of the old games like Xenon 2, Lotus, Zool and Zone 66 (Cant find a MOD of that game :cry: )</div></div><hr />

their installers are really cool, as well as some other elite installers that have all custom/movable grfx/ascii and etc.  some of these people are extreamly intelegent.<br />
<br />
wow thats a nice ass installer, man that looks awesome, and sounds awesome too. it plays a few songs aswell. man, how do i get one of those :D custom direct3d/opengL or something, plus the random mods.. life doesnt get that goood. damn you c++ guys that know everything, i only know simple stuff count &gt;&gt; lalaalalaalaala</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apollo51</div><div class="date">6th March 2004, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">But the music options they use are cooler than a custom page :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">4th April 2004, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">So you can use the original BASS.dll to use all the formats supported by it, that means:<br />
<br />
stream (MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, custom generated, WMA &amp; CD via the add-ons), MOD music (XM, IT, S3M, MOD, MTM, UMX), MO3 music (MP3/OGG compressed MODs), and recording functions<br />
<br />
can be usable with NSIS, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apollo51</div><div class="date">4th April 2004, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">yes when the dll is copied into the plugins directory.<br />

api calls to the dll are within bassmod.nsi from the post above (example.rar) there are macro's in it at the end of the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
BASSCD 2.0 (.0.5)<br />

<br />
And that didn't work because that code was only supportable for MOD files, I'm doing a header file for all file types supportable by DLLs now, please be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">4th April 2004, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">OK! The header file is here, but to preserve all original options I did put a more complex code to work with. You need at least to know how to call plugins with System Plugin.<br />
<br />
And you need to have:<br />
<br />
- BASS.dll - to use about all functions available in the header file.<br />
- BASSCD.dll (not really required)- to use some functions to play/rip CD music.<br />
- BASSWMA.dll (not really required)- to use some functions to play .wma files.<br />
- Is recommended that you have the documentation of each component above to know how to use the codes correctly.<br />
<br />
Get all of them at un4seen.com.<br />
<br />
Extract the files inside the zip file below inside &quot;YourNSISDir\Contrib\BASS&quot; folder.<br />
<br />
The header file with an included example (without plugins):</div></div><hr />

No I did not, BASSMOD.dll is smaller and I wasnt using it to play MP3, those files are too large for small installations.</div></div><hr />

next time you want to contribute something, publish it here or  in the nsis archive.</div></div><hr />

I did post this code in the NSIS archive a while ago, but it must have been lost somewhere.<br />

Sorry, but I hate people who &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot;. It wastes so much good programming time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metamorphium</div><div class="date">28th November 2005, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am sorry to revive the old topic, but I am not able<br />
to make this last example (with mp3) running. I downloaded both - the latest bass.dll and header files and put them into some correct path. Script compiles ok and shows the BASS functions as loaded. It also shows no error and I can test it. Upon testing there is no sound. <br />
<br />
I tried to insert some message box to debug if there is anything going on which shows so that means that functions are being called. I also checked sound and mp3 which alone is correct (Using the default test mp3 file).<br />
<br />
Any help or advice would be deeply appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
