I am hoping someone can maybe explain what I'm looking at and what I need to do to get it up and running. I would really appreciate any input.<br />
<br />
I found all the scripts through Google so I'm not sure if it's what I needed but this is what I have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends HOW you want to install your driver(s).<br />
Are they .exe files and you want to execute it one after another silently or do you want to do a &quot;real&quot; install of the driver files with your script?<br />
<br />
if they are .exe files you only have to find the silent switches (for example: setup.exe /S). <br />
What switch you have to use depends on the install engine the driver have. Installshield has another one as InnoSetup. Just google for &quot;install silent switches&quot;.<br />
<br />
if you found some you have to test it and if they work you can implement it in you code:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;driver1&quot;<br />
setoutpath $PLUGINSDIR ;set %temp% as otput dir<br />
File &quot;PrinterDrvSetup.exe&quot; ;extract this exe to %temp%<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\PrinterDrvSetup.exe&quot; /S' ;execute Setup from %temp% silently and wait for finish<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
But if you want to create a &quot;real&quot; driver installer it will be more complicated. Have a look to the InstDrv Plugin.<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />

I'm looking for this software to do the same thing as going to manufactures website and downloading the missing drivers manually pretty much by pressing &quot;Next&quot; alot. So I guess I'm looking for a &quot;real&quot; install of the drivers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highcoder</div><div class="date">29th April 2011, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I think i know what you mean.<br />
<br />
You are NOT a hardware manufacturer who want to do a driverinstaller for his own product right?<br />
But you want ONE driverinstaller for all your hardware in your computer that installs all drivers &quot;on the fly&quot; without thousands of ok/next/yes klicks right?<br />
<br />
For this case the first method will work for you. Download all drivers you want to integrate in your installer from manufacturers website.<br />
Find out which installersoftware they use. MSI, Install Shield, InnoSetup, NSIS etc. etc...<br />
This is important because every software has its own silent switch. Silent install means that the driver setup shows no window, no questions, no progressbar, no next/ok klicks on install. That is what you need.<br />
<br />
If you know all silentswitches you can integrate all driver setup exe files in your installer and execute them silently one after another.<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />
