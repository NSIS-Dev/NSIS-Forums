<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jtanner</div><div class="date">13th May 2003, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">is there a tool or something that will allow me to use NSIS as a VB Project packager, instead of the Packagae &amp; Deployment Wizard?<br />
<br />
Id like to pack my Installer files using NSIS instead of the standard VB tool.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this, or know of a tool to do it??<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">13th May 2003, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you can make the hole<br />
process by your self.<br />
That means to have to know all<br />
the files req. by your app (ocx, dll, etc).<br />
Read Manual, check the examples, make your app<br />
and... pump up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">firefly2442</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I make VB programs.  All you need to do is check what runtime files it needs and include them along with the .exe compiled file and any other support files. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dick4</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 04:05</div></div><div class="posttext">make the installer through the package and deployment wizard and then extract the cab file and you have all the files you need.  There is also some hints somewhere around here on how to install the vbruntimes (which can be silent).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dick4</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I do this at one point (I also need mscomctl.ocx)<br />
<br />
Section &quot;VB Runtime DLLs&quot; SecVBRuntimes<br />
 SectionIn 1 4	<br />
 Setoverwrite off<br />
 Setoutpath $SYSDIR<br />
 File &quot;C:\Dev\mscomctl.ocx&quot;<br />
 RegDLL $SYSDIR\mscomctl.ocx<br />
 setoutpath $TEMP<br />
 File &quot;C:\Dev\vbrun60sp5.exe&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
then later I do this:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;-Install VB Runtimes&quot;<br />
 IfFileExists &quot;$TEMP\vbrun60sp5.exe&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
    Exec &quot;$TEMP\vbrun60sp5.exe /q&quot;<br />
SectionEnd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, shouldn't it be like this:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;-Install VB Runtimes&quot;<br />
 IfFileExists &quot;$TEMP\vbrun60sp5.exe&quot; 0 +2<br />
    Exec &quot;$TEMP\vbrun60sp5.exe /q&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
The current code you have (IfFileExists &quot;$TEMP\vbrun60sp5.exe&quot; &quot;&quot;) is useless, and won't do anything!<br />

<br />
Well, considering that you've spent all that time writing the program, a couple of hours ensuring the install works well, will certainly pay off in the long run.<br />
<br />
I would use the PDW to create a dependency file (.DEP) so you can see which files are needed for your app, then collect them together manually and use NSIS from there...<br />
<br />
I would also, as others have shown, use the VBRun60SP5.exe (or the files contained) for your VB6 Runtimes, rather than using the files generated with the PDW into a the CAB file: if the PDW did a good job of pulling together all the files you need, you wouldn't be here ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zodiak</div><div class="date">25th May 2003, 01:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
I use the Inno setup compiler.<br />
For VB just use the PDW to get all the files needed for your app then import the files into Inno.<br />
It is fast, nice looking and quick way to turn any programming language into a setup file. It has a file import wizard and options for importing any text file for license in the setup. just tell the setup what file you want it to execute when the user clicks finish and it opens it. This will install your app to (C:/Program files) folder and create desktop icons, start menu folder, and quick launch icon.<br />
