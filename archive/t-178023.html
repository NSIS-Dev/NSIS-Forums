<br />
My uninstall doesnt seem to remove certain files from the INSTDIR. I noticed in a couple of posts in this forum that the files may be in use. I would like to know if this is the problem in my case and was wondering if NSIS has any debug log which can tell me the exact reason why it could not delete a file (win32 api tells you the reason, so I am assuming NSIS too would know the reason). If yes, how to turn on the debug log and where it would be.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you running the uninstaller manually or are you calling it from the installer?<br />
<br />
If the uninstaller is called from the installer using the switch as described in the FAQ it won't be copied to a temporary location and you can't use RMDir /r for $INSTDIR.</div></div><hr />
