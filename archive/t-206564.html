<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">1st February 2005, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been looking for something like this and I cannot find it. I need a function that will open a file for writing. It is looking for any word which means the word does not have to be<br />
[list=1]<br />
 on a line by itself<br />
 starting the line off<br />
[/list=1]<br />
It seems every function I've come across on the archives in no way happens to do what I am trying to get done. I am simply trying to find a word in a file and then replace that words entire line.<br />
<br />
This word can and will be 99% of the time<br />
[list=2]<br />
 NOT on a line by itself<br />
 NOT starting the line off<br />
[/list=2]<br />
I've tried working on my own script to accomplish this but it seems I can only get as far as replacing the word ONLY if it is on a line by itself. Can someone help lend me a hand on this please. World of thanks!<br />
<br />
PS. I'd like to call this task the Afrow UK challenge. Sorry Afrow ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">1st February 2005, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel I should be a bit more descriptive with the kind of function I am seeking.<br />
<br />
 It should not do a crazy loop. The new line might contain the old string again.<br />
 No new line should be created above or below the target line.<br />
 Possibility to find a string on the end of a line and replace ONLY everything before that string. <br />
 Anything else you feel might be important to a function o fthis nature.<br />
<br />
major thanks to anyone who can help with this :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
${WordFind}/${WordFind2X} and ${LineFind}/${LineRead} will do the trick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vbgunz</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yak! I am certain the Function does as expected and I don't want you to change it so can you add a new Function with the ability to CopyBetween?<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I was looking for a way to CopyBetween and put the copy into $0 and then use $0 as the value to ReplaceBetween. You understand?<br />
<br />
Sorry if I mentioned it with misunderstanding. I do prefer though after looking at your function that they do stay seperated. Sharp.<br />
<br />
File1<br />
&lt;yadda&gt;<br />
This is found in file1 and will be copied. A backup file exist and it is sort of like a database. It will basically serve so many different purposes.<br />

Meanwhile, I updated the ReplaceBetween function to make it a tiny bit faster.<br />
