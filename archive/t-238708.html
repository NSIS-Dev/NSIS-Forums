<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">komsbomb</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 08:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I'm a Inno Setup user. But Inno lacks some features like uninstall page wizard. So I plan to switch to NSIS.<br />
<br />
So one question,<br />
If I install my previous version software (installed by Inno), and then I install the new version by NSIS, there will be two 'Uninstall' items in the start menu!<br />
So is there any easy way to install the new version but remove all previous informations written by Inno?<br />
I don't want to force the user to uninstall the existing version.<br />
Should I have to hack into Inno to remove all files and reg keys produced by Inno?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glory_man</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of information writed by Inno?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">komsbomb</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean the installation informations. Such like the uninstall info Inno writes to the registry, and the uninstaller file Inno creates in the install path, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glory_man</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Just delete uninstaller and change (or delete) registry information. :D Instrucions - Delete, DeleteRegValue, DeleteRegKey. Why you can not use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">komsbomb</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't there any helper macros to do that?<br />

I'm seeking a simpler way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not really, and to be completely honest I'd be very surprised to find that any of the various installer packages like InnoSetup, InstallShield or the like had anything like this.<br />
<br />
Installation packages tend to be custom to those creating them, and thus so too is the information these packages create for uninstallation.  They might all follow a standard pattern laid out by the packages default config, but there's no guarantee that someone won't have altered it in some critical way - no &quot;helper macro&quot; could predict that.<br />
<br />
Using a series of Delete, and DeleteRegValue/Key commands is about as simple as you can possibly get really, and a darn sight more reliable and customisable than any form of helper macro :)  If you have a lot of very similar applications, you could probably then turn this series of commands into your own helper macro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">komsbomb</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all.<br />
<br />
Now I know what I shoud do, delete, delete, and delete. :-).<br />
Maybe I should use some registery monitor program to find out what Inno will write to the registry.<br />
Can anyone figure out what the keys are that Inno write?<br />
Maybe I should ask this in Inno newsgroup or do the hack by myself. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Use regmon<br />
http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Regmon.html<br />
<br />
But in most cases INNO only write the uninstall keys and that can be used or is similar to NSIS keys, eg:<br />
- UninstallString<br />
- InstallLocation<br />
- DisplayName<br />
- DisplayIcon<br />
<br />
To determine where older installations were put you have to <br />
read out theses inportant keys (the rest is not neccessary)<br />
or some use some specific keys from programm itself (eg<br />
hkcu/software/&lt;program&gt; or hklm/software/&lt;program&gt;)<br />
<br />
be sure to be compatible to your own installers - EVER.<br />
<br />
InstallShield is complete different - it is possible to have<br />
a clean silent uninstall - but i dont recommend this.<br />
Just inform your user that another instance is installed and<br />
user should uninstall it manually.<br />
<br />
NSIS can do a lot for you - just code it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">komsbomb</div><div class="date">23rd February 2006, 01:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I will DIY it.<br />
<br />
I don't want the user to uninstall the app because it will remove the config files in the previous version.<br />
<br />
I will hard code the delete routine in NSIS.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
I didn't port my Inno script to NIS, but to fully rewrite my Inno script in NIS. That's easier to do than blindly porting!<br />
Because I'm too new to NIS, I use HM NIS Editor to create a basic script, then I add what I need to it.<br />
<br />
Your Inno scripts are very simple, even not include any code? So you should just to user HM NIS Editor to get a basic script, then add all files in it. Of course the editor can help you add files too.</div></div><hr />
