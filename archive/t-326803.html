<br />
Sorry if this is obvious, but I'm new to NSIS and this one is confusing me.<br />
<br />
I've setup an installer, and it all seems to work as expected, except that I can't get the MUI 2 appearance to work (as per the screen shots in the manual).<br />
Mine comes out smaller and greyer (which I am assuming is MUI1).<br />
<br />
I've read the documentation (which is a bit dense I have to say) and looked at the examples, and I can't see what I'm doing wrong.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas?   <br />
<br />
P.S. I have included MUI2.NSH  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 02:48</div></div><div class="posttext">MUI1 and 2 look pretty much the same, post your code on nsis.pastebin.com or something, it is impossible to tell whats wrong by just your post (My guess would be wrong/missing language macro)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JRF</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 03:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, Thanks for the quick reply. I didn't want to post a long lisitng here, but I see how it's difficlut to help based on what I said.<br />
<br />
Here's the URL on pastebin: http://www.nsis.pastebin.com/kVyqkaC7<br />
<br />
When run it looks like Inst1.jpg, whereas I think it should look like Inst2.jpg.<br />
<br />
I'm probably making an obvious mistake but I'm not seeing it. :( <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 03:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Just add !define MUI_HEADERIMAGE to the start of your script, that will give you the image with the blue fade. To get the larger components list, define MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_SMALLDESC or MUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_NODESC<br />
<br />
The colors are just XP vs Vista/7 I guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JRF</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent, that did it. The actual colours refelct how Windows is configured, and I use a scheme Microsoft call 'silver' I think. It was the layout that was the problem, which is now fixed. <br />
I guess I was assuming that things would mostly default to some reasonable value, just to get started, and they do but not to produce the same result as shown in the documentation. That's were I got stuck I think.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Anders, thanks for your help. This is a good forum.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the components description has the wrong default, but as far as the header goes, using the icon makes the installer more &quot;custom&quot;. While you can customize the bitmap to something other than the nsis default images, it does require you to actually create a image while the icon is automatic.</div></div><hr />
