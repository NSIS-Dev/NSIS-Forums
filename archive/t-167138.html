<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">i have been able to solve this by<br />
heading to the main Configuration files and changing the<br />
Default ICON<br />
<br />
for some reason in there programming they<br />
have made it so that the first install and the 2nd uninstall icon have to be the same SIZE.......<br />
<br />
wierd :(<br />
<br />
They don't need to include a editor or anything but <br />
only need to lift the restriction of matching icons :)<br />
and that's done in the programming :)<br />
<br />
&quot;I think someone would have to see a need for it I guess<br />
and that would depend on the programmers&quot;<br />
<br />
It's easier then you might think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I do know where I am talking about. <br />
<br />
If the installer generates the uninstaller it replaces the icon data.<br />
<br />
To support different installer/uninstaller icon sizes the installer would have to include a resource data editor (which would waste a lot of space).<br />
<br />
Usually people have the same icons formats for similar icons.<br />
<br />
To change icons you don't have to modify anything, just use the icon settings in your script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Try that with the Modern UI<br />
Because when i tried using differn't icons<br />
event the ones supported in the program<br />
if it wasn't the same size the compile would fail on it<br />
<br />
but when I changed the Modernui File<br />
Located at C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI<br />
 at lines 105 and 106<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_ICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-blue.ico&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_UNICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-grey.ico&quot;<br />
<br />
If they don't match they fail<br />
the Defualt if I remember right was<br />
modern-install.ico<br />
and if I tried to replace it with <br />
modern-install-blue.ico it would work because they are both 14k and then when I tried to do it with<br />
modern-install-blue-full.ico<br />
or any other file that had the same color pallete and the same colors or close to it <br />
I could not use them unless they matched the Defualt mentioned ICO referance :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not like saying who's right<br />
the Programmer or the customer either lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You are really making things too difficult. You don't have to hack any Modern UI files to change the icons. You only have to define MUI_ICON and MUI_UNICON.<br />
<br />
Your icons don't have to match the default icons, the only requirement is that your installer and uninstaller icons have the same image formats. That should not be a big problem, because almost everyone ones the same icon format for two similar things.<br />
<br />
It's not about the size of the compiler, it's about the size of generated installers. It's about your customers who have to download or store your installers.<br />
<br />
Including a resource data editor in the installer executable would really be a waste of space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Try it go to<br />

!insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_UNICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-grey.ico&quot;<br />
<br />
and change once of those icons<br />
to like any of the other icons that are not 3k<br />
<br />
using Nsis 2.0 R3<br />
Try this one an compile and see what happens<br />
!insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_ICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-blue.ico&quot;<br />
!insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_UNICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\modern-uninstall-colorful.ico&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again: You don't have to change Modern UI files to change icons, just define MUI_ICON and MUI_UNICON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh i forgot to tell you I did try that already and that's what braught me to hacking the files in the first place :):up:<br />
<br />
Make it look like this<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_ICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\llama-blue.ico&quot;<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_DEFAULT MUI_UNICON &quot;${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Graphics\Icons\modern-uninstall-colorful.ico&quot;<br />
<br />
and you will get this error<br />
Error finding icon resources: number of icons doesn't match -- failing!<br />
Error - aborting creation process<br />
<br />
or can use the Thing you mentioned and name them that and compile and see what happens you will get the same error :(<br />
<br />
the Only way i have been able to get around this is go back to the Original files and edit them .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">30th January 2004, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">my dear. he said:<br />
DEFINE them, not insert macros, that dont exist!<br />
u should use these commands:<br />
!define MUI_ICON &quot;installer.ico&quot;<br />
!define MUI_UNICON &quot;uninstaller.ico&quot;<br />
that's working for me, and, believe me, i know too what i'm talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">30th January 2004, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I did define them in the install<br />
but when ever I had 2 icons of differn't sizes<br />
the compiler would error<br />
<br />
Only when I went into the main configuration files and changed the insert macro Default icon is when it changed for me<br />
<br />
if i changed the default icon size i could then define<br />
in the install script any icon of that same size<br />
and that would work as long as i defined 2<br />
of the same size icons that matched the size of<br />
&quot;The Icon Mentioned in the main Configuration file&quot;<br />
that's what I have found :(<br />
<br />
But then again it may be because of the Operatig system<br />
or other programs running that could interfere with<br />
Nsis ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">30th January 2004, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Please read what I posted at least 5 times.<br />
<br />
You can not use two icons of a different size. That is just how it works, because the installer has to overwrite the icon data when generating the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
Whether you set it in your script or do anything else, that makes no difference.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to with operating systems or other applications.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shea</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You said it overwrites it so shouldn't it be able to have an icon that is bigger than the install icon becuase its overwriting it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 01:53</div></div><div class="posttext">where's the problem? if you want your installer to have a 4 color icon, but your uninstaller to have a 16 million color icon, just save the 4 color icon in 24bit. really no big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx we were trying to figure out what was wrong with the icons was it the default size and such<br />
<br />
but I was hoping it did go by a pallete<br />
<br />
we needed someone that knew the real information<br />
of why we were getting conflicts with difern't icons<br />
thank you.<br />
<br />
so 24 bit icons don't have conflicts with all the other stuff ? if that's true man thax I've been waiting to<br />
here some more cool stuff :)<br />
and that's cool.:weird:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">same palettes, same sizes (if one icon is available in 16x16 and 32x32 the other must come in the same sizes)</div></div><hr />

You said it overwrites it so shouldn't it be able to have an icon that is bigger than the install icon becuase its overwriting it? <br />
It's the resource data structure. It the icons size would be different the installer would have to update that whole structure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rjstephens</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">forgive me if i'm wrong but couldn't you just use the same icon for both the installer and uninstaller, then use a resource editor to change the icon for the installer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">That won't make a difference. The installer does not include the whole uninstaller exectutable (that saves size), it generates it based on itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shea</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't. If you change the icon with ResHack or something the installer fails.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never had so much fun with a installer.<br />
<br />
How did this come down to 1 itty bitty icon ?<br />
If windows allows for many colored icons and uninstaller icons and alot of other installers allow for this can we not have the same functionality ?<br />
<br />
Can we vote on this ?:eek: :igor:</div></div><hr />
