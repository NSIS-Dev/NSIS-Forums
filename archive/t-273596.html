<br />
I have spend the last few days trying to create an installer that does the following:<br />
<br />
The installer is started with RequestExecutionLevel user and includes five sections. Four of those sections have functions that need to be executed as a user, those work fine.<br />
The fifth section will start a executable, but it requires a vista admin account. The executable I try to start has the &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot; setting.<br />
<br />
I have tried to use the UAC plugin, but it will ask for a admin password when starting the installer. Most users will not require the fifth option and therefore I would like the installer to ask for an admin password only when choosing or executing the fifth option in the section list.<br />
<br />
Example 1: <br />
<br />
<br />
install_no5:<br />
  UAC::RunElevated<br />
  UAC::Exec '' '&quot;$INSTDIR\${APPFILE}&quot;' '' ''<br />
 <br />
<br />
This causes the installer to ask for a admin password, but after logging in the installer starts all over again from the top and the executable does not start.<br />
<br />
Example 2: <br />
<br />
<br />
install_no5:<br />
  ExecWait '&quot;$EXEDIR\Setup.exe&quot;'<br />
 <br />
<br />
This causes the executable to run when the user is an admin, but when the user is not an admin he will not execute anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope someone can point me into the right direction with this issue.</div></div><hr />

It is not possible to elevate a process on the fly, only new processes, thats why it works this way<br />
<br />
2:<br />
I'm not sure if I understand the problem here, but you might want to use userinfo::GetAccountType and disable the 5th section on your components page if the user is not a member of the admin group</div></div><hr />

<br />
I now have included the solution given to you in point 2. <br />
<br />
It's rather strange that a default user, running an installer in &quot;RequestExecutionLevel user&quot; mode, can not start a different installer with &quot;RequestExecutionLevel admin&quot;. (You would think that you would just get the &quot;administrator login screen&quot;, just as you would get when starting the installer through Windows Explorer)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">2nd July 2007, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">A possible answer to that is that ExecWait uses createprocess and only ShellExecute will elevate when needed, createprocess just dies with an error.<br />
If execshell works correctly but you need to wait, you could use UAC::ShellExecWait</div></div><hr />
