<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th February 2006, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Every once in a while I get a comment about some sentence in the documentation which is &quot;unprofessional&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot;, &quot;crude&quot;, &quot;foul&quot;, etc. Some people don't like the usage of words like &quot;poop&quot;, &quot;crap&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot;. Personally, I don't mind these words there and I don't intend to do anything about them. I know some people agree with me and some disagree. But I'm not here to start another discussion about it.<br />
<br />
If you do mind and care to do something about it, here's the deal. Submit a patch that improves something in the documentation and also removes some of these &quot;crude&quot; words. A patch that will contain both fixes or improvements to the documentation and removal of &quot;crude&quot; words, will be happily applied by me. A patch, or a complaint about &quot;crude&quot; words, without anything else, will have to wait for someone else.</div></div><hr />

I hope to see the changes very soon after I submit them.</div></div><hr />
