<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clockwatcher</div><div class="date">29th May 2007, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">My application uses the WinHelp help system. As many of you may be aware, WinHelp is not supported by Vista. I know that the proper solution to this is to update my help documents to a supported help system but unfortunately I don't have the time at this point.<br />
<br />
I checked around the Microsoft website and found a WinHelp installer for Vista - an msu file. What I planned on doing was updating my NSIS install script to call this msu file and silently install WinHelp during my application's installation. Here's my code:<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;wusa.exe $EXEDIR\winhelp.msu /quiet /norestart&quot; <br />
<br />
When I try to execute this on a Vista box, I don't get any errors. But when I check to see if the patch installed correctly in Control Panel --&gt; Programs, I see that it didn't install. When I try to launch the help documentation from my application, it doesn't launch.<br />
<br />
I can manually install WinHelp on the machine and it works fine, it's just that I was hoping to silently install WinHelp so the user isn't bothered with installing it. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Also, if any of you can suggest a good help format and an application for creating help files in that format I would be thankful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did find this article which I think is the root of my problem...<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929761<br />
<br />
This problem occurs because Wusa.exe does not make the appropriate Windows Update Agent (WUA) API call that notifies the WUA that the package contains a custom software license agreement. Also, Wusa.exe does not notify the WUA that Windows Update can install the package without displaying the custom software license agreement. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
