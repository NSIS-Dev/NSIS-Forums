<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ASterX</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
does anybody know a way for successfully registering an VB-ActiveX-Exe ?<br />
<br />
If one would do it manually one would just start the file with the parameter /regserver -&gt; 'c:\myActiveX.exe /regserver'.<br />
I tried different ways:<br />
- ExecShell &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe \regserver&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
- ExecShell &quot;open&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe \regserver&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
- Push &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe&quot;<br />
  Call AddSharedDLL<br />
- RegDll &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing worked.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there must be a way to solve this (by now I'm running a batch file - doesn't look very nice).<br />
<br />
Anyone ANY ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Use Exec instead of ExecShell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ASterX</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just forgot to put it in the list - I tried that also but it seemed that no parameters were accepted, one message like &quot;file not found&quot; or similar appeared.<br />
It seemed windoze thought that &quot;C:\myActiveX.exe /regserver&quot;<br />
is only the path to the file and not a path and a parameter. There fore I tried 'ExecShell'.<br />
<br />
But when you tell me it works like that you probably have tried it out, it worked and you can tell me what my fault was ?<br />
<br />
=&gt;&gt; one correction by the way:<br />
ExecShell &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe&quot; &quot;\regserver&quot;<br />
has been my try</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course you do have to put quotes around a filename with spaces.<br />
<br />
ExecShell '&quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe&quot; /regserver'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ASterX</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, no.<br />
It won't do.<br />
I think I nearly tried everything around it, quoted, unquoted, $\&quot;-quoted, with inner and/or with outer quotes, with '- an with &quot;-characters; for being sure I just tried your example again.<br />
It won't do.<br />
Are you sure you have been succesfully registering an VisualBasic-ActiveX-Exe doing it that manner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ASterX</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">btw. neither Windows ME nor Windows 2000 seem to work with this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I have never registered a VB ActiveX EXE, I just explained you how to use Exec.<br />
<br />
It it works fine when you are using the Windows console it will work fine this way too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spatacoli</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you try this?<br />
<br />
ExecShell 'cmd /C &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe&quot; /regserver'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">That will make absolutely no difference and it won't work on Win9x.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spatacoli</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah, sorry, I didn't see the OS. please ignore my post.</div></div><hr />

Of course you do have to put quotes around a filename with spaces.<br />
<br />
ExecShell '&quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe&quot; /regserver'  Joost if you use ExecShell shouldn't the command look like this?<br />
ExecShell &quot;open&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\${PRODUCTNAME}.exe&quot; &quot;/regserver&quot; <br />
Vytautas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">20th February 2004, 07:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I already said that Exec should be used but I copied the wrong line.<br />
<br />
ExecShell &gt; Exec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ASterX</div><div class="date">20th February 2004, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thanks to all for wasting their time with this problem. <br />
It's embarassing (and no one will belive me) - my box seems to have had bad days, today it works like Joost said. Everything is behaving like one would expect it as if nothing has been happening.<br />
Again, thank you for your help, it really didn't work yesterday, I promise not to get on anybodys nerves again...</div></div><hr />
