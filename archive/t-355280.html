Is rtf unicode compatible? I know that rtf is ansi. It should even say \ansi in the header. But it escapes characters. Would that make license.rtf still usable?</div></div><hr />

In theory it answers the question, but practically I remain unsatisfied.<br />
<br />
Wikipedia states that there are two types of escape conversions. (I refer you to the link.)<br />
<br />
What appears to happen when you insert unicode into rtf in MSWordpad is a conversion to the code page escape. For the character ƒç (c-hachek), for example, the encoding matches &quot;\'e8&quot;. Unicode is, or should be, &quot;\u010D?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Do you know, if in a Serbo-Croatian license, the escape sequence &quot;\'e8&quot; would be correct? In the NSIS installer ... ?<br />
<br />
Does anyone use an rtf license in unicode?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i guess you would have to compile with unicode nsis (https://code.google.com/p/unsis/) though</div></div><hr />

<br />
i tried wordpad, textedit (osx), google docs and libre office - none of them even offer an option to choose the encoding when saving as rtf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnicer</div><div class="date">29th January 2013, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Does NSIS use MS software (an algorithm?) for rtf, or implement the rtf standard (read/decode) itself? I got worried because MSWordpad escape characters don't follow any known rules. Until I read the Wikipedia entry, I thought that. Now I think there is a method different to anything else and untransparent, typical Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I'm not reporting a problem I recently had, only wondering if there has never been a problem. Thank you for the 2.46.5 links. I've been meaning to upgrade and I was looking for that page. ;)</div></div><hr />
