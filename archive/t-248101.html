<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senser</div><div class="date">7th June 2006, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to redirect the output of a KiXtart script (running kix32 with the script as a parameter) to the current open DOS console window (if installer is started from a DOS command prompt)<br />
<br />
The use for this: I'm creating a silent installer that contains kix32.exe and a kix script. These two files are extracted and then run, currently I'm using ExecWait and that works perfect. Only one thing I would like to improve: the installer should not a new DOS window if the installer is started from a DOS window, only if the installer is run from Explorer a new DOS window should be started. This way the look and feel of a command line tool is created by the installer. <br />
<br />
I've already looked at ExecCmd, ExecDos and nsExec, great tools but I don't think I can use them in this case. <br />
<br />
Hope I've made myself clear. :)</div></div><hr />

So you need a plug-in that can find installer' parent process and, if this is console, send kix command line to it's window and run it. May looks funny.<br />
Another way - to hide kix process and send script output to parent console. ExecDos flushes output, so you can read log file to simulate 'alive output'. Not tested.</div></div><hr />
