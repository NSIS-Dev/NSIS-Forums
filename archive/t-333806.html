<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcSlayer</div><div class="date">19th August 2011, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">is there a way to execute dos command?<br />
like for installing services: &lt;service name&gt; /install<br />
or for adding registry: reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\... /v &lt;app name&gt; /t REG_SZ /d &lt;path&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">19th August 2011, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">When I google 'NSIS dos command', the third hit gives everything you need...  Next time, please bother searching for the answer before asking.<br />
<br />
However, I fail to understand how dos commands relate to services and/or registry. NSIS has a big list of registry functions that you can use (see the manual). Services can be installed with a plugin. Again, google is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcSlayer</div><div class="date">22nd August 2011, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry may be i search with the wrong keyword.<br />
and yes there a plugin related to services and registry.<br />
for the registry it work fine with me(the problem was on windows UAC. when i turn it off, my application work fine).<br />
but for the services, i try using plugins to install my services. it can install my services but my services cannot run, stopped, or uninstalled even with UAC turned off. when i work on my services application, i install it manualy to test it using dos command and it can start, stop and being uninstalled.<br />
i don't know what is going wrong, so i try to use dos command.</div></div><hr />

Add 'requestexecutionlevel admin' and use the UserInfo plugin in .onInit to verify that you got admin access (and throw an error and quit if you didn't).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not always true, I have dealt with several services that had to be self registered by use of a command line switch or they would not operate correctly (do not know if that is his issue or not).<br />
<br />
But to answer the question have a look at ExecWait in some cases I have had to use nsexec::exec or nsexec::exectostack.</div></div><hr />
