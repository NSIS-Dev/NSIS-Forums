Does anyone know if it's possible to show 'information' - either text or pictures etc - during the installation like e.g. Windows does???<br />
What I mean - after starting the real installation process (so when the file copying starts etc) you can hide the detailed information - some applications show stuff like release notes or 'did you know' stuff in this free section during the installation.<br />
Is this possible with NSIS or any of the plugins???<br />
I've search for it - but it was hard to describe (at least for me)... So I didn't found anything.<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Nico</div></div><hr />
