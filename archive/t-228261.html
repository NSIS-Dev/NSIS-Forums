<br />
The nsis documentation doesn't mention the /r flag (for recursion?). <br />
<br />
This /r flag seems to work with the Modern UI but not &quot;standard&quot; nsis. Is there some &quot;magic&quot; happening such that the MUI includes library.nsh and/or filefunc.nsh?<br />
<br />
IMHO, seems flawed that the MUI would change this behavior.<br />
rmdir /r <br />
is available for what <br />
delete /r<br />
seems to want to accomplish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">/r is a flag for RMDir only because RMDir can delete directories(!) recursively.<br />
Delete is for deleting files only it does not have this flag!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I was looking at a commented out statement or something. It was code generated by the EclipsePlugIn and then modified by a nsis newbie with even less nsis experience than myself. I'll try to be more careful before posting.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you might remove this entire thread to preclude confusion?</div></div><hr />
