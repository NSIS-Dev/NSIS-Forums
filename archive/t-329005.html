<br />
I wonder if there is a way to complile some files into the Setup.exe to hide them from the eyes of the customers.<br />
In the $INSTDIR i have two folders. lic which contains somie license files and src which contains registry files, scripts, etc. pp.. Basically i want to hide my know how.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to include these two Folders into the Setup.exe? This way i also need to distribute only the Setup.exe file which contains all the necessary data.<br />
<br />
It would be possible to put the whole NSIS stuff into an self extracting archive, but this would make the whole build process more complex and i want to avoid that if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

<br />
Aehm... if you do a normal setup all installfiles are stored INSIDE the NSIS executable so they are hidden.<br />
<br />
Section<br />
  setoutpath $instdir<br />
  file &quot;c:\foldercontainlicensefile\licensefile.lic&quot; ;for one file. Or do the next line...<br />
  file /r &quot;c:\foldercontainsmorefiles\*.*&quot; ;for a bunch of files/folders (preserves file/folder structure)<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
So these files would be stored in installer executable and will extracted to the $instdir during setup.<br />
<br />
The normal way. So i wonder how do you do it?<br />
<br />
sincerely</div></div><hr />

That seems true for all the file i want to Install by copying them. But there are also some Files (most of them) i execute without moving them.<br />
Probably i should've tought about moving them to temp bevore executing.<br />
<br />
The main install is done with an MSI file which has not yet been replaced with a more suitable method.<br />
<br />
But thanks. Didn't see the obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. The idee to extract them to %temp% and execute them seems to be the best way.<br />
<br />
Section<br />
  setoutpath $pluginsdir<br />
  File &quot;c:\folder\test.exe&quot;<br />
  execwait &quot;$pluginsdir\test.exe&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Function .OnInit<br />
  InitPluginsdir ;initialitze the (unique) NSIS tempfolder for this installation<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
have fun. :)</div></div><hr />
