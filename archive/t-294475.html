<br />
I have an installer which performs installing the vb runtimes , using VB6RunTime.nsh , I also made my own sections for a few custom dlls provided to me by the vb shell developer of my project, uptil now it has worked on all machines ive tested on , more than 6 vista machines and two or three xp until friday , where i had another users vista machine give me a Run-time error '48' error in loading DLL.<br />
<br />
I have always noticed that during the install , when the installer is handling the vb6 files it always displays 'could not load' during the handling of msvbvm60.dll . I have ingored this up till now as it never seemed to effect the install and has always worked. Why does this display? (I downloaded the needed DLL's from sourceforge)<br />
<br />
So the info im looking for now is this, I need to eliminate the possibility that im not unpacking/registering these dlls incorrectly before i have the vb developer tear into his code looking for an error, could a skilled nsis mod/dev person please look at my script quickly and let me know if all is good?<br />
<br />
my custom section is named Section &quot;-otherfiles&quot; it starts on line 258 using HM NIS Edit .. I have attached the nsi file<br />
<br />
<br />
thank you<br />
<br />
Ian</div></div><hr />
