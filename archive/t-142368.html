<br />
1) When using VIAddVersionKey to specify version information in the installer, it's added to the uninstaller as well. It'd be great if you could have it so it wouldn't appear in the uninstaller, or at least a command giving you the option.<br />
<br />
2) I know there's an &quot;AddSize&quot; command that allows you to do this manually, but what I'd like to see is the size of the uninstaller in kilobytes added to the &quot;space required&quot; value on the components page automatically.<br />
( -&gt; Which brings me onto another point: how is the &quot;space required&quot; value calculated? It seems to be off by a few kilobytes.)<br />
<br />

Brad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I am testing a new installer I include some build details in the version information which ends up in the installer and in the uninstaller. This makes it easier to identify the installer used to perform a particular installation as all I have to do is check the version information in the uninstaller.<br />
<br />
At the moment I am adding support for different languages and find that I often build the installer several times a day; having version information in the uninstaller makes it easy to keep track of all my test installations.</div></div><hr />
