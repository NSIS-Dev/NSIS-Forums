<br />
It would seem that it will install correctly if the device is plugged in, but not before that. I've searched the forum and there's several people reporting the same problem, but no answer. This problem, however, seems to occur in XP, but works fine in Vista.<br />
<br />
I've also tried DPInst from MS, but it failed to install the driver.<br />
<br />
Any help or suggestion would be appreciated, thank you.</div></div><hr />
