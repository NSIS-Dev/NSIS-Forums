<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pawel</div><div class="date">25th January 2008, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I got a following problem. Before uninstalling my application I have to kill some processes in Windows (run by my application).<br />
<br />
I know it can be done for example using this plugin (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/KillProcDLL_Manual), but I need to kill process only from specified path. For example:<br />
<br />
My application is installed in: C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe.<br />
This applications runs other process, Process1.exe, from <br />
C:\Program Files\MyApp\Proces\Process1.exe<br />
<br />
This can be kill by above plugin (kill by process name).<br />
<br />
But, let's say we have Process1.exe also in the other directory, for example C:\Program Files\RunMe\Process1.exe, and this process can't be killed - I want to kill only this from specified path. I hope you understand what I mean :)<br />
<br />
So, my question is How to kill a process that runs from specified directory?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

I got one more question.<br />
I use it like this:<br />
<br />
Function LockedListShow<br />
    ${If} ${AtLeastWinNt4}<br />
	!insertmacro MUI_HEADER_TEXT `Programs to close` `Programs to close`<br />
  LockedList::AddModule /NOUNLOAD &quot;C:\\Program Files\\TC UP\\TOTALCMD.EXE&quot;<br />
  LockedList::AddModule /NOUNLOAD &quot;C:\\Program Files\\TC UP\\PLUGINS\\Media\\XnView\\xnview.exe&quot;<br />
 <br />
  LockedList :: Dialog /ignore &quot;Next&quot;  <br />
  <br />
    ${EndIf}  <br />
	<br />
FunctionEnd <br />
<br />
1. The plugin find this programs and display on the list. We can close them by rigth click menu.<br />
I want to close it automatically, after clicking Next button (if user ignore my request).<br />
Is it possible?<br />
<br />
2. Can you tell me how to translate the following words from the plugin page? (I use multilanguage interface) It is:<br />
Listview header: Application, Process<br />
Right click menu: Close, Copy list<br />
<br />
Thanks for help,<br />

<br />
For now I am afraid you will have to go without the /ignore option.<br />

Hello Stu,<br />
<br />
Could you do this features in nearest future? When could you do this?<br />
If You don't have time, can I do it by myself and use it in my installer?<br />
Thanks,<br />
