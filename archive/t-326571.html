<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blh83</div><div class="date">27th January 2011, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I need the long string build as a customer had his PATH hosed :stare:.  However, when I extracted the executable and stubs folder and tried to build, I would get a Windows error saying makensis has stopped working.  The last few lines of the compile are:<br />
<br />
!define: &quot;UMUI_MAINTENANCEPAGE_MODIFY&quot;=&quot;&quot;<br />
!define: &quot;UMUI_MAINTENANCEPAGE_REMOVE&quot;=&quot;&quot;<br />
!insertmacro: UMUI_PAGE_MAINTENANCE<br />
<br />
This is when the window pops up so I assume it is the maintenance page causing the problem.  Does anyone know of a way to fix this?  I realize this isn't a lot of detail about my script but I am hoping it is a known issue with an easy fix.  I have to have this done today so I am looking for any suggestions or questions no matter how trivial they may seem.  <br />
<br />
Would it make a difference if I compiled NSIS myself?  If so, can someone point me to the file location of NSIS_MAX_STRLEN so I don't have to go digging for it.  I do have SCONS and Python so if this will be the quicker route I will try it.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">27th January 2011, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">1) This is probably a bug in UMUI or one of the plugins it uses, it is not uncommon for plugins to (wrongly) hardcode the buffer size to 1024<br />
<br />
2) I have seen this %Path% issue so many times now that it really is time for someone to rewrite the wiki samples to use raw win32 api calls without length limitations.<br />
<br />
3) NSIS_MAX_STRLEN can be set with a scons parameter IIRC, running scons -h (or -H) should show a list of nsis compile options</div></div><hr />
