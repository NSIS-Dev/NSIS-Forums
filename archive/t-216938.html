I did'nt know if that's the right place to post my request, but if it is'nt the right place, please tranfer it to the right forum.<br />
I was wondering if there is a plug-in or anything that could make the playlist easier to work with.<br />
Think about that, you have something like 300 songs in the playlist, and it's hell messy, and you don't want to start orginazing all of your songs by the type ect.. I don't say that the existed playlist way is difficult or anything, but I would like that the playlist will have an option to create sub-entries (like sub-folders) that you can drag songs there and expand it when it's needed.<br />
It could be really vital and handier way of working with the playlist.<br />
If what I have just said is already existed, I'll be thankful for a guide/link about that.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Tal.</div></div><hr />

It should be on Winamp Discussion (http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=8) (or it could be also on Winamp Wishlist (http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=3) if the plug-in you want doesn't exist).</div></div><hr />
