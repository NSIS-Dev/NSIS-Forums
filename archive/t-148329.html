<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zilch</div><div class="date">6th September 2003, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just grabbed the CVS snapshot from today (Sat, 06 Sep 2003, 07:44:14 GMT) because I was having problems with the beta on the downloads page not detecting the Windows system language (the latest CVS fixes this).<br />
<br />
The problem that I am having now is that using Modern UI, all of my language installs have some English text that I can't replace.  As you can see from the example jpg (first screen of MultiLanguage.nsi), most of the text is in German except:<br />
<br />
&quot;Check the component that you wish to install and uncheck the components that you don't want to install. Click Next to continue&quot;<br />
<br />
This is similar on other pages.<br />
<br />
This text seems to be represented in $NSISDIR\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files\German.nsh as MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_TOP:<br />
<br />
&quot;Wählen Sie die Komponenten aus, die Sie installieren möchten und wählen Sie diejenigen ab, die Sie nicht installieren wollen.&quot;<br />
<br />
But this text never shows up in the installer.  Strangely there is no MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_TOP in the English.nsh.<br />
<br />
This text (or something similar) does appear in $NSISDIR\Contrib\Language files\English.nlf on line 87 under # ^ComponentsText, but editing this doesn't cause any change in the install, so I am assuming that it's not being read from there.  I assume it is being written directly from lang.cpp.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me if this is a known bug?  Is it being worked on?  Or has the MUI_INNERTEXT_COMPONENTS_TOP simply changed to something else?<br />
<br />
Part of my confusion may be because I don't really understand the relationshop between German.nsh and German.nlf when using Modern UI.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Zilch.</div></div><hr />

A new German language file has just been uploaded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The German.nlf file in the CVS (updated about 44 hours ago) seems to be a version 5 one, whereas the English one (22 hours ago) says version 6.  Am I missing something?  (quite possible as I haven't used CVS before)<br />
<br />
I get 2 warnings:<br />
  GERMAN language file version doesn't match. Using default English texts for missing strings. (macro:MUI_LANGUAGEFILE_BEGIN:11)<br />
  LangString &quot;MUI_BUTTONTEXT_FINISH&quot; is not set in language table of language 1031<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Public CVS access is currently 24 hours behind. The development snapshot has already been uploaded since the German language files have been updated. You can get it at http://nsis.sf.net</div></div><hr />

<br />
All language files have been updated to contain another line saying if the language they define is RTL or LTR. It doesn't mean the contents or the version was updated. Unfortunately, we still don't know that many languages ;)</div></div><hr />
