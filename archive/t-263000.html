<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th January 2007, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You could call GetPwrCapabilities using the System plug-in and check the SystemBatteriesPresent member of the SYSTEM_POWER_CAPABILITIES struct. I'd say batteries on a computer are a pretty good indicator to a laptop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Under normal circumstances I would agree but for example my desktop pc is connected to an APC Back-UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), which is being recognized as &quot;system battery&quot; by windows due to the USB connection it comes with. ;)</div></div><hr />

there are indicators for mobile chipsets.<br />
<br />
you also could try for the same with grafik chipset.<br />
<br />
or with mainboard chipset :)<br />
<br />
try to find out if there's a central indicator for notebook hardware.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hard to do I guess unless there isn't some special point. e.g. the power saving capabilities are also available on some entertainment pc's which use laptop processors.</div></div><hr />

It should set UpsPresent to TRUE, not declare it as a battery. In that case, BatteriesAreShortTerm can be added to the test as UPS is usually short term. I guess a serious UPS with long term capabilities, like one running on fuel won't have a USB connection :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">19th January 2007, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">then, give me a hint:<br />
<br />
what does your installer do with the users system, that it cant or shouldnt do with a system, that works somekind similar to a notebook but is not really one? (pc with ups, mediacenter pc with mobile cpu, ...)<br />
<br />
which functionality are you really looking for?</div></div><hr />
