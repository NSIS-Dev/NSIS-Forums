<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benjohnson</div><div class="date">16th December 2010, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a beginner so please be gentle! Having a few problems with the stack, messages seem to be appearing where they aren't expected so it's throwing a few things off.<br />
<br />
Firstly, using the NSISList plugin to make a list of the files which need updating, and was then attempting to download them as they are recalled from the list. Code is below.<br />
<br />
	${List.All} UpdateDLL<br />
	Loop1:<br />
	Pop $0<br />
	DetailPrint &quot;All: $0&quot;<br />
	NSISdl::download ${Server}/$0 $0 $R0<br />
	StrCmp $0 &quot;__ERROR&quot; +2<br />
	StrCmp $0 &quot;__LAST&quot; 0 Loop1<br />
<br />
From my limited knowledge I would have expected the files to be listed separately as $0 when they are recalled, printed as &quot;All: Filename&quot; and then downloaded from my server, saved as Filename with the return value in variable $R0. However, it is downloading the first one fine, but all others it see $0 as 'success', the return code from the first download.<br />
<br />
I made a messagebox appear after the first download and $R0 is definitely the return code while $0 is the filename so I can't figure out where the problem is the second time round.<br />
<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
