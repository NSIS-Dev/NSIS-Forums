<br />
I've created a plugin for NSIS that can display an InputBox. This is very handy for quickly asking for a password, serial etc., without using the whole InstallOptions stuff.<br />
<br />
I always wanted NSIS to include such a function (hint, hint ;) ) and since I wanted to practice writing plugins for NSIS I created this. It's merely a wrapper for Delphi's InputBox-function.<br />
<br />
It should be very easy to use. You just push three strings (caption, prompt and default value) onto the stack and call the function 'ShowInputBox'. The plugin will return the input from the user onto the stack.<br />
<br />
There are some problems though...<br />
<br />
 The DLL is about 377 kB, which is rather large compared to other plugins. That's because it is created using Delphi functions and not plain WinAPI. Maybe I'll do a rewrite some time.<br />
<br />
 In order to let the NSIS window be the parent of the InputBox I had to do a quick 'n dirty hack into Delphi's 'Dialogs'-unit. And as far as I know it's not permitted to distribute the source code of this unit. So I can't include the full source code of the plugin. But maybe I'll figure a way around this.You can download the plugin from this location:<br />

I hope you like it...<br />

Although that feature can be handy in IO itself.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure a Win32 call with the System dll would have done the same job?<br />
