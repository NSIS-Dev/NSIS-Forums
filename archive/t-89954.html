<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaraza</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to override which Installation Type is selected by default?<br />
<br />
usually, it's the first one, but I would like to control that depending on the user's previous selection.<br />
<br />
E.g. if they have a choice to install an Oracle, MS SQL Server or Sybase version of an app, the second time around I want to select by default the same installation type.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? I'm testing on 02.00 alpha 0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 07:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You can disable sections at runtime. This way you can adapt the sections that are selected depending on previous installations (e.g. by writing setting to the registry). The installer will automatically adjust the InstType selected to the sections selected. If the selected sections do not form an InstType, custom will be selected.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaraza</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but I don't want to disable them, I just want to select a different one as a default.<br />
<br />
It's quite normal for example for a client who was once on Sybase to move on to Oracle during an upgrade. If the registry settings would force them to only select Sybase, that wouldn't work too well...<br />
<br />
Also, I disable custom using<br />
InstType /NOCUSTOM<br />
<br />
BTW, I noticed a small bug in 02.00 with this. Even though I have no custom, all the un-selected sections for each InstType do not show using disabled bitmaps. Therefore, the user thinks he/she can click on them, even though they can't.</div></div><hr />
