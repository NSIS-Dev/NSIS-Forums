I do not, but would like to work out a procedure that I can test with our installer and then suggest it as standard proc. to some of our admins who deploy to large numbers of computers.<br />
<br />
Has anyone used the RunAs plugin in production for this?  How would you suggest handling the admin's password?</div></div><hr />

You have the server side take care of that. Try psexec to execute the installer on the remote machine with any user you want.</div></div><hr />
