<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vc6</div><div class="date">9th February 2007, 06:13</div></div><div class="posttext">As a programmer with a very low budget, I am using the free Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition which does not come with &quot;Visual Studio Installer&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, it does come with the <br />
&quot;Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&amp;displaylang=en)&quot; which allows me  to distribute critical library files with my program (provided that I know how to do that).<br />
<br />
I would like to use NSIS for the purpose of writing an installer for programs developed with VC++ 2005. I think that I NSIS supports running an executable like the vcredist_x86.exe described in the link above (please correct me if I'm wrong).<br />
<br />
However, I also need to distribute some other library files (also from Microsoft) which only come in the form of MSM files.<br />
<br />
Previously, when I was using VC++ 6.0, I was using Visual Studio Installer 1.1 (which came with it for free, and can only install on a system that has VC++ 6.0), to package those MSMs in a .MSI file, which in turn was embedded and run in the .NSI file.<br />
<br />
The point is that Visual Studio Installer 1.1 was taking care of all the inner workings of placing the MSMs in one .MSI file that simply works - but now I don't have that tool anymore.<br />
<br />
Any idea whether there is an &quot;NSIS&quot; way to accomplish the above? If so, where can I find a description of it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Victor</div></div><hr />

A quick Google search for msm2msi also came up with the following.<br />

Thank you so much for your helpful tips. I wasn't aware of these tools.<br />
<br />
By WiX, did you mean the Windows Installer XML, located at wix.sourceforge.net?  <br />
<br />
(sorry I just learned that I can't include URLs for some reason, so I am providing the address without the http).<br />
<br />
BTW, the missing link above was for vcredist_x86.exe, freely downloadable from the Microsoft web site.<br />
<br />
I am rushing to check out the resources you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
