<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">11th April 2011, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">i've added the &quot;/can 1&quot; switch in a nxs banner, but whenever i hit cancel the banner will stay until the current operation is complete (in my case a InetLoad operation). i've looked into the HasUserAborted command, but it seems it's meant to check whether the button has been clicked and has no influence &quot;on-click&quot;.<br />
<br />
any ideas why cancel isn't working? also what happens when it's working, will the installer jump to nxs::destroy?</div></div><hr />

Just because you can cancel the banner doesn't mean it sends some sort of message to the installer and all running plug-ins to cancel them too. Something like that would need some protocol which we would all need to agree on, and of course nothing like that exists. The point of the cancel button is for use in a loop that you write yourself whereby you check if the button has been clicked in order to exit the loop.<br />
