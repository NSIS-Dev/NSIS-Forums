<br />
please bare with me as I am extremely new to NSIS and scripting in general.<br />
<br />
I am close to having my first installer work, but the problem I have is that when it is done and I try to run the setup.exe, it says I need double the space for the install than I should.<br />
<br />
My project consists of 11.5 GB of data in 18 folders. I am using BZIP2 compression, and it seems that the compiler is running thru the process twice.  The results of the compression seem to be that the first &quot;Aspect Ratio FX&quot; also gets a redundant file added to it and as a result, becomes twice as big... thus needing twice the space to install.<br />
<br />
If anyone can help me figure this out, I would be most appreciative. Here is the source code:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th October 2005, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">You use both:File /r &quot;${SRC_DIR}\${SUB_DIR}&quot;andFile /r &quot;${SRC_DIR}\${SUB_DIR}\Aspect Ratio FX&quot;Aspect Ratio FX is already included with the first line. You extract that folder twice.<br />
<br />
Please attach large scripts next time. It makes the thread really hard and annoying to read with scripts pasted in the message without even [ code ].</div></div><hr />
