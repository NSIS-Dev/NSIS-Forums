<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iarp</div><div class="date">9th March 2012, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an installer that's almost done, I've been doing hundreds of tests on my vmimages that don't have anti-virus and when i run it on my machine with Avast it runs fine.<br />
<br />
Norton sees it as a virus and auto-deletes it. Chrome won't let me download it without &quot;malicious&quot; messages..etc<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what i can do to change this so they don't see it as such.<br />
<br />
According to virustotal.com Kaspersky sees it as &quot;HEUR:Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Generic&quot; and one other sees &quot;W32/Downloader&quot; but the rest only show &quot;-&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I changed from NSISdl to inetc and only kaspersky complains according to virustotal.com and norton no longer auto-deletes the file upon download.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell them that FALSE POSITIVES can occur and that this is a FAILURE in the specific a/v software, so only the a/v developer can fix it...<br />
<br />
(If only more users reported false positives or dump buggy a/v software, the developers would have take more care)</div></div><hr />
