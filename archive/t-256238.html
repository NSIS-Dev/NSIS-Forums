<br />
I have a very strange problem and need your Help:<br />
<br />
Windows XP has the feature to show newly installed programms highlighted in the start manu. First, it shows a bubble with the text &quot;New program installed&quot;. If the program folder is opened, new entries are highlighted yellow.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the created unistall.exe is always shown as new (has yellow background) which is quite irritating for users. Sometimes this &quot;bubble&quot; is also shown again and again..<br />
<br />
After some digging in the network, I've learned that the file version info is used by Windows to detect whether the file is new. Thus, I used the functions<br />
VIProductVersion and VIAddVersionKey to set this information.  But it does not change anything...<br />
<br />
Now, I'm quite helpless and need some assistance.. Please, don't let me stay out here in the rain! ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Stefan</div></div><hr />

It points out some rules about what is considered 'new' and states that uninstallers should not be shown.  <br />
<br />
Considering this is a blog site, I'm not sure how accurate the info really is.  But, I did notice in your original post, you misspelled &quot;uninstall.exe&quot;.  (yours is spelled &quot;unistall.exe&quot;)  I'm not sure if this was just misspelled in the post, or if your actual file name is also misspelled--if it is, you might give this a shot.<br />
<br />
If not, then I'm at a loss...  (Maybe someone else has some more dirt on this...)</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot for your link!<br />
<br />
The blog just states that new files are highlighted and that they are various reasons why special shortcuts are ignored.<br />
<br />
My situation is the opposite way: The file &quot;uninstall.exe&quot; (unistall.exe was just a typo), is shown as new, which is very annoying.<br />
The blog says that files are shown as new, until they are executed.. This isn't the behavior I see on windows and it wouldn't be a big help on that file, anyway! ;)</div></div><hr />
