<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaschulz</div><div class="date">14th September 2003, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I just noticed that none of the accelerator underlines on the installer buttons shows.  The obvious accelerator keys work, but the button text does not show the underlines (except when you actually click the button, but you have to watch very carefully to see that).  I haven't messed with the Modern UI dialogs, so I assume it must be that the button height in the default dialogs is one or two pixels than it ought to be.<br />

If auto hide (a Windows feature) is on you'd have to hold down the alt key to see the accelerators.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaschulz</div><div class="date">14th September 2003, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right.  Holding down the ALT key does show the accelerator underline.  I have never heard of that setting before.  Do you know where it lives and/or how to change it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

P.S.  On another topic: I am going to give your UpdateDll macro a try, but looking at it, it seems to me it ought to have a cousin that would handle the uninstall business (when a reboot is required).  I am going to write an installer for a &quot;DeskBand&quot; application and deleteing the dll (after it is unregistered) almost always requires a reboot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To uninstall a DLL installed with UpgradeDLL (that's not a system DLL which should stay) simply use Delete /REBOOTOK, there is no need for version checking if you just want to remove it.</div></div><hr />
