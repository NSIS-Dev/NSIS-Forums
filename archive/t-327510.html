<br />
In order to pass some parameters from a website to an exe file, I dynamically append 68 bytes of data to it whenever a user downloads it.<br />
<br />
Now I'd like to have an installer for this application, but with a setup file I obviously can't append this data directly to the executable. From asking on IRC, I know that it won't break the installer when data is appended to it. So what I tried to do is append the data to the installer and then write it to the installed exe file during installation. I tried to adapt the ReadCustomerData script from the wiki, but my script fails to do the job.<br />
<br />
This is the relevant part of my script, I added some error checking to find out what's going wrong:<br />
  # Backup variables<br />
  Push $1	# sbar.exe file handle<br />
  Push $2	# installer file handle<br />
  Push $3	# current byte<br />
  Push $4	# read count<br />
  Push $5	# write count<br />
  IntOp $4 $4 &amp; 0<br />
  IntOp $5 $5 &amp; 0<br />
  ClearErrors<br />
  <br />
  # Open sbar.exe to write (seek to file end)<br />
  FileOpen $1 &quot;$INSTDIR\sbar.exe&quot; a<br />
  FileSeek $1 0 END<br />
  DetailPrint $1<br />
  <br />
  # Open installer to read<br />
  FileOpen $2 &quot;$EXEPATH&quot; r<br />
  FileSeek $2 -68 END<br />
  DetailPrint $2<br />
  <br />
  IfErrors error<br />
  <br />
  loop:<br />
  # Read and write one byte<br />
  FileReadByte $1 $3<br />
  DetailPrint $3<br />
  IfErrors done<br />
  IntOp $4 $4 + 1<br />
  FileWriteByte $2 $3<br />
  IfErrors error<br />
  IntOp $5 $5 + 1<br />
  Goto loop<br />
  <br />
  error:<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK &quot;There was an error processing the file (read=$4, write=$5).&quot;<br />
  Abort<br />
  <br />
  done:<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Read $4, wrote $5 bytes.&quot;<br />
  # Close files<br />
  FileClose $1<br />
  FileClose $2<br />
  <br />
  # Restore variables<br />
  Pop $4<br />
  Pop $3<br />
  Pop $2<br />
  Pop $1<br />
When I run the installer on my Win7 x64 as admin, a message box pops up, saying that zero bytes have been read and written (i.E. 'done' label). If I interpret that correctly the files could both be opened but the reading operation fails.<br />
<br />
This is my first script (and nsis installer), please tell me if there's some stupid mistake.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Yep, thanks for that.<br />
<br />
Btw. is there a better way to initialize a variable to zero other than 'IntOp $4 $4 &amp; 0'?</div></div><hr />
