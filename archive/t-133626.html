<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">transnote</div><div class="date">29th April 2003, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to create an NSI package that deletes a number of registry entries and folders on the hard drive which have files and subfolders in them, some files MAY be in use.<br />
<br />
The problem I'm having is that I can't seem to specify /R and /REBOOTOK at the same time, and /REBOOTOK doesn't seem to delete them when restarted.  Any help is appreciated on how I can get the folders that may be in use to be deleted, or anything else to make this work better! :)<br />
<br />
thanks guys</div></div><hr />
