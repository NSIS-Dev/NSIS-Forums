<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">altie</div><div class="date">2nd February 2010, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent about a week of poking at this, working on other parts of my installer and coming back to it.  The EnumCDs, CABSetup and Cdrom plugins all look relevant but I haven't found an example of how to check for a particular disc.<br />
<br />
The context for my request: I'm building an installer that grabs a bunch of patches off a network drive, installs some games from disc (Crysis in particular is one I'm working on) and then it applies the patches.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">2nd February 2010, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The CD-ROM plugin isn't going to work - it doesn't support DVDs. I created some functions once that will probably do what you need: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/DVD_functions<br />
<br />
I still use it to my satisfaction, maybe it'll do you some good.</div></div><hr />

If you can think of anything I can do to improve this code, let me know.  I may refactor it to use your functions later.  Either way, a piece of sample code for this task on that page would be very helpful.  I'll post it if I end up using your functions.</div></div><hr />

That is of course assuming the user won't decide to put the next disk in another CD/DVD drive.<br />
