<br />
Like Joel said, unless you are packaging the nsi source file into your Installer, there is no way they can see <br />
your nsi source file.<br />
That nsi source file is compiled into a whole different command structure, and unless the person built an decompiler for NSIS, they wouldn't be able to make heads or tails out of whats there.</div></div><hr />

Though I do agree that it would be really nice if NSIS installers could be made more solid. Would it be possible, say, to make the compression algorithms randomize their behaviour?</div></div><hr />

I suppose if you had any real &quot;secret sauce&quot; you wanted hidden, you could make a plugin to do it.<br />
Obviously the &quot;hacker&quot; could get your plugin .dll, and attempt to decompile that as well, but at some point, if you are that worried about things, you probably should consider moving to an Installer that isn't free, and has encryption at its cornerstone.</div></div><hr />

NSIS is an OpenSource project. It lives from people contributing to the community, sharing their scripts. What in the world is so bad about people &quot;extracting&quot; your installer? If someone has got your installer, he/she will get the files anyway by running the installer. Also: One the one hand you want use NSIS for free, on the other hand you want to keep your script in private. I call that egoistic...<br />
<br />

the encription make the files cant be compressed :P  I bet you haven't even test it though.<br />
Anyways, this conversation does not lead somewhere. Perhaps nsis does not cover your needs, thus probably you should go for a more sophisticated installer. Whenever you find it let me know please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">30th June 2008, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Encrypting the files *before* encoding will hurt the compression indeed. That is because compressing files always means entropy coding. After the files have been encrypted, they will &quot;look&quot; and behave like random data (unless you decrypt them with a proper key). I believe this will prevent efficient entropy coding (compression). So if you really want to encrypt the files, you should compress them first and then do the encryption. This of course will prevent solid compression, except you encrypt your files as one solid block of data...</div></div><hr />

Indeed it uses 7-Zip to extract the NSIS installer. And indeed it gets some files out of the installer. However some folder names are incorrect, like &quot;$[31]&quot;. Furthermore they obviously use a disassembler to create that &quot;[NSIS].nsi&quot; file. If you look at this file you will notice that this is NOT your original script. It's a very poor disassembly! Of course almost everything is lost, like function names, variable names and all the macros. So the resulting script is totally useless. And where have all the strings gone? The disassembly event won't compile! Instead of looking at this disassembly you could simply run the installer and look at a memory dump. The information you get are the same...<br />

LoRd_MuldeR: I have red your post two times and it reads about SOME disassembly, but HOW did they made it? (I don't understand this things well.) <br />
<br />
How did they make it? I guess they implemented it! If you can compile a program, then you can disassemble it as well. Simply translate every binary instruction back to the corresponding textual representation. Since NSIS is OpenSource this shouldn't be too hard to implement. Of course some information cannot be restored, like variable/function names and macros. That's because those information simply are NOT present in the compiled binary. Also all comments and all the code formatting is lost for obvious reasons. That's why the disassembly is more or less useless. You end up with a load of code that looks like a mess. And in this case it even won't compile...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot protect strings! If your installer &quot;knows&quot; (uses) the string, then it must be stored somewhere in the EXE file. Of course you could try to encrypt the string and decrypt it at only at runtime. But even if you mange to keep your key a secret (the key must be stored somewhere in the EXE file too), still the string would be in memory at runtime. So somebody could do a memory dump and obtain your string. Guess why those new &quot;unbreakable&quot; Copy Protection systems like AACS (Blue Ray Disc) have been broken that fast! They didn't crack the protection itself, they simply grabbed the &quot;secret&quot; keys from memory while playing the disc in a legitimate player. This cannot be prevented without special hardware mechanisms (like a TPM), it can only be made more difficult by using techniques of &quot;obfuscation&quot; ...<br />
<br />
BTW: Modifying the NSIS source codes and &quot;randomizing&quot; some of it's data structures would be one method of obfuscation. But that is NO real security! It's called &quot;Security through Obscurity&quot;, which basically means there is no security at all!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">1st July 2008, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">is all the same.<br />
<br />
As i told previously, the nsis is not the same, but all the commands as the calls to my internal compressor with passwords, are exposed. And sorry but an opensource tool not mean we must share the scrips because yes and yes.<br />
<br />
As i said this is not serious, because include a monkey is able to extract the passwords or all the needed from the extracted nsis script.<br />
<br />

That's because the installer must be delivered to the user and the passwords must be stored in the installer somehow (otherwise the installer couldn't work). You could try to encrypt your passwords, but then you would have to store the decryption key in the installer as well (besides the problem that the passwords could be grabbed from a memory dumb anyway). So there simply is NO secure way to do that. Obfuscation can make it harder to &quot;extract&quot; your passwords and it might cause some disassemblers to fail. But it's no reliable protection. If somebody wants, he/she can circumvent your password protection easily...</div></div><hr />

Nope, there is no difference between &quot;script extraction&quot; (disassembly) and &quot;security&quot;. I have explained that enough now, so I won't explain again. Simply read previous posts in this thread any maybe the referenced threads...</div></div><hr />

Or in your words: The script can be extracted (although &quot;extracting&quot; is not the proper word). That's a fact you cannot change. Also it's not a NSIS problem.

This would make the decompiler at least have to work a lot harder on figuring out what each command is.<br />

Specifically, what if we were to allow &quot;per script build&quot; randomization of &quot;exehead\fileform.h&quot; of the enum of NSIS commands?<br />

<br />
You can call it &quot;extraction&quot; over and over again. But it's still a disassembly. The script is NOT extracted, because it's NOT in the installer file! The disassembler &quot;restores&quot; the script from the binary program code. Look at the file, it's totally different from the original script. Of course it is! Disassembly is a whole different thing than &quot;extraction&quot; and it's NOT a problem of NSIS. Once and for all :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
Yes, this should be possible. But as said before: this would be &quot;Security through Obscurity&quot;. And one of the first things you learn when you get in touch with Security in Software Development is that &quot;Security through Obscurity&quot; is a really bad idea. So you always have to assume that the Attacker has full knowledge about how your protection works. Nevertheless I agree that some obfuscation might help to prevent Scriptkiddies from &quot;extracting&quot; (see the Quotation marks) your installer too easy. But don't make the mistake and think this is a &quot;safe&quot; protection...<br />
<br />
Last but not least I think an OpenSource project like NSIS should stand for TRANSPARENCY instead of OBFUSCATION. There already are enough companies that bother the users and developers with their obfuscations attempts...</div></div><hr />

We could see that with any installer.  Just watch the Installer &quot;exec&quot; off any processes.  The command line to your &quot;unuharc.exe&quot; you see will be the exact same as you would see in NSIS.</div></div><hr />

Of course the primary purpose of Universal Extractor is extracting files from archives. Yes. But it uses 7-Zip to extract the files from a NSIS installer. 7-Zip also is NOT a disassembler. Yes. Nevertheless it is obviously using DISASSEMBLER techniques to create that &quot;[NSIS].nsi&quot; file. That file cannot be &quot;extracted&quot; from the installer (like all the other files), because there is no such file in the installer! It's not there! However the script file can be &quot;restored&quot; from the installer code easily, because the installer code MUST be in the installer (otherwise the installer couldn't run). The process of restoring textual &quot;Assembler Code&quot; from binary &quot;Machine Code&quot; is called DISASSEMBLING. And that's exactly what's happening here. If you like to hear that or not. It's so obvious that there is no doubt. Just look at &quot;[NSIS].nsi&quot;. It's NOT your original script, it's a DISASSEMBLY of your installer code.<br />

@Red Wine: This post is not to pump my post count. I don't care about post count. I just want to explain that issue. thanks...  Sure, but all of you guys just repeating the same things over and over again. There's nothing new just an endless repeat. This is at least tedious, what else could I say? The subject has been already discussed as I said ages ago when this annoying thread started.</div></div><hr />

the things are not fully discussed.<br />
Because the last i must to say is about an old version of nsis where the nsi script is not extracted by the universal extractor. I think it was the 2.03 version.</div></div><hr />

Well,  you think wrong or you haven't read at all the discussion. Could you tell one single news regarding to the subject which has been added through this endless annoying conversation?<br />
Anyways, I wouldn't follow further the annoyance, as I said DOES NOT offer anything more than setting the focus on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are wrong. This discussion will not lead to a &quot;fix&quot;, as there is nothing to fix. I won't argue over this, because all has been said in this thread. So please re-read my previous posts as well as Sheik's posts and try to understand. Further discussion is useless until you understand the crux. Thank you!<br />
<br />
BTW: If 7-Zip doesn't disassemble NSIS v2.03 installers, this does not mean v2.03 is any safer! It just means the disassembler isn't compatible to v2.03 yet. Maybe the developer created the disassembler with up-to-date NSIS and didn't care about &quot;outdated&quot; versions. Nevertheless it will be easy to adjust the existing disassembler for older versions, if anybody wants that. So nope, using the older NSIS version won't give you more protection. No version ever will or ever did...</div></div><hr />

Simply, just as simple as it gets, after 50+ posts, show me ONE single thing that this discussion adds, fixes, or whatever it does.</div></div><hr />

Storing passwords as plain text in NSIS code has never been safe and never will be. Simply because you can get the strings from the memory at the run time (see the attachment). And no obfuscation can prevent this.</div></div><hr />

You cannot protect strings!<br />
<br />
I am NOT stupid and I KNOW why are all strings in &quot;disassembled&quot; script. Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thek</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">A solution for your problem would be to generate the password from a user entry, or get the passwords for your secret files via the internet.<br />
<br />
So the passwords are not stored in the installer.<br />
This would be quite secure (depending on security of the internet connection, trustworthy of the enduser and so on) because in the Installer is nowhere a direct string<br />
<br />
or you store the passwords in a text file (ini format or similar) which is send along but encrpyted (again with a userentry to decrypt it)<br />
<br />
<br />
But this would be only workarounds of the problem.<br />
I'm not an NSIS-profi but it is a tool for installing software, not for cryptograhpic purposes :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">of course if we use the &quot;DcryptDll&quot; the key is also exposed, true ? I mean when extract the files with universal installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thek</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">No because you have to supply the key via an userinput and not hardcoded in the script...<br />
<br />
if you put the key in the script you have lost, there is no way to &quot;secure&quot; it there. (only obscuring is possible)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">and how can we work with that &quot;obscuring&quot; in nsis ?</div></div><hr />

and how can we work with that &quot;obscuring&quot; in nsis ?  <br />
<br />
Be creative! Don't save you password as a simple plain string! Cut your password into several strings, add random characters to those strings and so on. Do everything that might confuse a person who is looking at the disassembly of your installer. At runtime you can calculate the correct password from the strings you have stored in your installer. And don't keep the result in memory any longer than you need it. But be aware that this will keep nobody away from reconstructing your password. It only makes things a tiny bit less trivial...<br />
<br />
<br />
Very very simple example:<br />
<br />
StrCpy $0 &quot;M&quot;<br />
StrCpy $1 &quot;O&quot;<br />
StrCpy $2 &quot;W&quot;<br />
StrCpy $3 &quot;R&quot;<br />
StrCpy $4 &quot;S&quot;<br />
StrCpy $5 &quot;Y&quot;<br />
StrCpy $6 &quot;S&quot;<br />
StrCpy $7 &quot;A&quot;<br />
StrCpy $8 &quot;D&quot;<br />
StrCpy $9 &quot;P&quot;<br />
<br />
MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Super secret password: $0$5$9$7$6$4$2$1$3$8&quot;<br />
<br />
StrCpy $0 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $1 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $2 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $3 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $4 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $5 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $6 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $7 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $8 &quot; &quot;<br />
StrCpy $9 &quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Extract&quot; that with Universal Extractor. You won't see the Password in plain text, but it's not too hard to guess the password :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arfgh</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">final conclusion. All this fact ruins the so good that the nsis is. At least for me !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">3rd July 2008, 00:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Then why not leave NSIS behind, stop bothering the people they try to help you and use some Installer that provides better protection (in your imagination). And better hope the 7-Zip developers won't implement &quot;support&quot; for other Installers :p</div></div><hr />
