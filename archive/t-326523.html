<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blh83</div><div class="date">26th January 2011, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know a work-around for calling a 64 bit dll from an NSIS installer file (since the installer-generated executable is 32-bit, you can't directly call a 64 bit dll without doing a Thunking layer).  I have a tight deadline coming up and would like to avoid writing a Thunking layer in the DLL.  Also, I can't compile the dll in 32-bit mode because the SDK that I am calling functions from is compiled only in 64-bit mode.<br />
<br />
Basically, the end goal is to be able to run this from my script:<br />
<br />
System::Call &quot;myDll::FindBindings()i.r0&quot;<br />
<br />
where myDll is a 64-bit dll.  I am happy to clarify as needed. Thanks in advance for any input.</div></div><hr />

You can use ExecDos::exec /TOSTACK which is preferable to nsExec::ExecToStack because it pushes each new-line-separated item to the stack rather than all in one.<br />

That is likely what I will do for now, I was just hoping there was another way around it.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
