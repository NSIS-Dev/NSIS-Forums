<br />
First, I have spent few hours searching for solution or answer to my question. If I have over looked, please do not flame this old man:) I really did search...<br />
<br />
What I am trying to do:<br />
<br />
Have a .exe file and related files like .bin, .bgr and etc. I would like to combine all of them into one .exe file that does not require installation on users computer. They only have to click on combined .exe to start/run.<br />
<br />
Is this possible to do with NSIS? If so could you please explain or point me to tutorial I have overlooked?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance. Trying to make it simple for younger students to use software.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">2BrainCellsLeft</div><div class="date">26th October 2013, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Anders.<br />
<br />
Do you mind assisting an old man little more please? Keep telling myself it is time to retire every year and now thinking it really is time, lol.<br />
<br />
Could you point me to a tutorial that will help me use the script/steps you posted? Sorry but head is thick and need little more help. Use to using installers like inno. Have never needed to have a standalone setup like requesting here.<br />
<br />
Just trying to make some science projects easier to use.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your assistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">2BrainCellsLeft</div><div class="date">27th October 2013, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">No help?<br />
<br />
Dang shame no one wants to help teachers anymore. But that is how it is, under paid and ignored, lol.<br />
<br />
Good day to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">27th October 2013, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">it's the weekend and people have lives away from here - and seeing as NSIS is a community developed project, you need to have some patience and not be impulsive and expecting instant responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">2BrainCellsLeft</div><div class="date">27th October 2013, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You are correct DrO.<br />
<br />
Sorry. Have to have a project ready for my 10th grade class in the morning so the pressure is on.<br />
<br />
I will try another method by paying for software. Very sorry to have bothered anyone and not having enough patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">28th October 2013, 01:26</div></div><div class="posttext">If you take the code I posted you will get errors about not finding myapp.exe, fix that and it will tell you there was no outfile command, add outfile mypackedapp.exe and you should be done.<br />
<br />
All you are doing is bitching about not getting any help instead of providing any kind of useful input. Did you try the code I posted? Any compiler error you don't understand?<br />
<br />
This is a scriptable installer, to do anything useful you will have to learn some commands and RTFM...</div></div><hr />
