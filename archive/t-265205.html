<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alstom</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 03:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
I heard there is a way of recording all the actions taken in a installation in a file and use the file to do a silent installation.<br />
<br />
How do we do that??<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
We change the installation directory in the installation and click some button in the installation, the file would be able to record down all the actions done in the installation.<br />
<br />
We would be able to use the file to do a same installation again without the user performing the same tasks again.<br />
<br />
This was possible with other installer, is it possible with NSIS???<br />
<br />
Million Thanks if anyone could help!!!<br />
<br />
Urgent!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for ur help but how do i use the files?<br />
<br />
I had downloaded the zip file. How do i use it to make a log of all the actions taken?<br />
<br />
I'm using NSIS to install a few installation programs. I would wish to do a silent installation by skipping all the next button and setting the directory into the installation automatically. The installation is done by using other installer, therefore I am not able to edit the installation using NSIS.<br />
<br />
The log file could be a great use to record all the action taken in the installation for NSIS installshield but could I do a log file for the other installation done by other install shield?<br />
<br />
Million Thanks if anyone could offer some help!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alstom</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know of the coding of the other installation, therefore was not sure of the section name.<br />
<br />
So I was not able to disable the button or skip the page.<br />
Therfore, is there a way to record a log file for all the actions done in the other installation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backland</div><div class="date">7th February 2007, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">You can most likely create your own custom system to dynamically configure your compiled NSIS setup using an external configuration file.<br />
<br />
NSIS does not have support for creating such logs to run unattended installs, so you will need to log your actions yourself and create your configuration system accordingly so that it can determine what actions to perform based on values in the external config file.</div></div><hr />

This sounds interesting! Could you please post an example on how one can accomplish this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backland</div><div class="date">7th February 2007, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't needed to create an unattended silent install, but it would be a matter of setting up an external config INI file with sections for each installer page and other general settings... for example:<br />
<br />
[InstFiles]<br />
Dir=%PROGRAMFILES%\Test\<br />
InstallVB=True<br />
InstallDirectX=False<br />
<br />
So if you code your installer to check these values and interpret them accordingly, you can configure your compiled installer like Alstom requested ;)</div></div><hr />

If I read you correctly, you are using NSIS to drive some 3rd party installers (some of which may be NSIS) that install several applications. What you are trying to do is get these 3rd party installers to run in an unattended mode so that you do not need to have any user interaction.<br />
<br />
If yes, then you can find some useful information on the AppDeploy (http://appdeploy.com/) page. There are also several forums that have information for different software packages (such as the MSFN (http://www.msfn.org/board/) board with its Application Installs (http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showforum=80) section).<br />
<br />
It would be good to know what kind of installer you are dealing with every time. There is a nice tool called Universal Silent Switch Finder (http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic=17940) which parses an executable wrapper and  will (most of the time) give you the type of installer that it drives, along with possible switches.<br />
<br />
If however you have no information whatsoever on the type of the installer, you can try to use a scripting tool like AutoIt (http://www.autoitscript.com/), which will push buttons, fill in values etc. and will generally deal with any GUI.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
