It goes away right away, but I'm wondering if it's telling me that something is wrong. Has anyone else seen anything like this? Thanks in advance!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 03:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I know what that small window is. I believe it's a function of using BZ2. It looks like it says something like the setup is unpacking. Is this correct what I am seeing? Is that normal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vytautas</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 03:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The windows will only appear if you use BZ2 compression and it will stay open while the files are uncompressed.  If the instraller is very large it can stay open for quite a while especially if the installer is on a cd.  The installer tells the user that the installer is verifing it's integrity and displays a progress of this.<br />

<br />
Do it to the UI before you make you installer and not to the installer itself as that would fail the CRC of the installer.<br />
