<br />
<br />
I have an installer for a &quot;mega-pack&quot; that downloads several of my other installers. it then uses command line 7zip to extract those installers to my plugin folder from the zip files they are inside of.<br />
<br />
I had the idea to use the command line 7zip to extract those EXE's and just pull the files out that I need. instead of running  the installers (I never set them up for silent installs and they have lots of message boxes etc). <br />
<br />
I am getting the  error &quot;can not open file as an archive&quot;. Am I missing some switch to set it to nsis compression? Do I need to change my compression type on the other installers?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
nevermind.<br />
<br />
 I solved my issue. I was using the commandline version. I needed the 7zG.exe and the DLL from the GUI 7Zip.</div></div><hr />
