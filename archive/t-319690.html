<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brandondash</div><div class="date">4th June 2010, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I've created an installer to automate the installation of several OSS products via silent installs. One of the products (postgres) installs itself as a service and creates a service account on the OS (windows) to run. In my installer I prompt the user to enter an account  name and password for this service account.<br />
<br />
Here is the problem:<br />
<br />
The Postgres silent install lets you enter any username/password you wish and will install completely without issue, BUT if you enter credentials that do not meet the minimum security requirements of the host OS that service will never start.<br />
<br />
Here is the question:<br />
<br />
Does NSIS have any plugins that allows you to poll your OS and make sure the username/password entered is long enough or complicated enough?<br />
<br />

This installer will be used on all manner of machines which will likely have different rules for their accounts. Since the installer will successfully complete regardless of if you provide valid input, I am stuck in a tough situation.</div></div><hr />
