I am new to NSIS, and it looks interesting.  However for the life of me I can't understand why there are no sample &lt;complete&gt; scripts on the website/docs.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any pointers to sample scripts?  I think if I could see one I would be up and running with my own installer.  I have read through the standard docs, but there are some gaps.<br />
<br />
For example - most basic issue - I understand defining sections and functions.  However, how do you know at runtime if a user selects a section (SectionIn), and how do you launch your file copying, reg settings, etc. dependent on these selections?  Am I just supposed to call a function inside of the applicable sections and the installer will take care of it for me??  The docs are unclear.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
