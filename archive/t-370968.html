<br />
I'm having a problem with NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator, but can't seem to reach the developer directly. I'm hoping someone here may be able to help me with it.<br />
<br />
I want to know if a subfolder can be chosen for the Start Menu location.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Instead of installing to a folder called FIGHT, I would like the program to be installed into GAMES -&gt; FIGHT (a folder within a folder).<br />
<br />
So, START MENU -&gt; PROGRAMS -&gt; GAMES -&gt; FIGHT<br />
<br />
You know, like a developer would do if they wanted to be able to have users install multiple programs of theirs into a folder matching their team or company name. Instead of having the folder for each program appear on its own in the main part of the Programs menu.<br />
<br />
When I try to configure the program to do this, I enter the following text in the &quot;Start Menu Folder Name&quot; box:<br />
<br />
GAMES\FIGHT<br />
<br />
But the program reports:<br />
<br />
&quot;Please specify a valid path for the installer.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have also tried entering: $STARTMENU\Games\Fight<br />
<br />
This too did not work.<br />
<br />
Is the program unable to handle subfolders? Or am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose this tool cannot handle '\' in the name of your Start menu folder = probably it is not supported to have subfolders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has anyone else created an NSIS generator tool that's as easy to use, which does support subfolders?</div></div><hr />
