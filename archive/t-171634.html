<br />
It doesn't seem like it has asked before, so here goes: I'd like to extend the ConnectInternet() and NSISDL macro by first checking whether the host has any RAS connection. If not, create one through code, and then call it. Before I dive into the RASAPI32.DLL, did anyone check how to call those API's from a NSIS script?<br />
<br />
Thx<br />
JD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I haven't looked into this yet, but I'd very much like to be able to create/use RAS entries, and have an NSIS script connect to a dial-up server, so that users who don't have access to the Net can still get updates easily through a BBS.<br />
<br />
But first, I need to figure out how to call a DLL from NSIS, and then look at some VB code to understand whether RAS32.DLL is the way to go, and if yes, how to call its APIs from NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With RasEnumConnections API, you can know what connections the host has, using the structure RASCONN.<br />
<br />
To connect to a RAS server from a host, use RasDial API using RASDIALEXTENSIONS and RASDIALPARAMS structures, and if you want to a dialog to appear about that, use RasDialDlg API. You can use including with these the callback APIs RasDialFunc or RasDialFunc1 to get messages from the connection.<br />
<br />
Use RasGetEntryProperties and/or RasSetEntryProperties APIs to get and/or set the properties of a phonebook entry. They need the structure RASENTRY.</div></div><hr />
