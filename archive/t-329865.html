<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gridly</div><div class="date">20th April 2011, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to backup some files that my install clobbers, and then restore them on uninstall. In the main section (where all the files are added) I do a bunch of:<br />
<br />
  CopyFiles &quot;$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil.bak&quot;<br />
<br />
In the Uninstall section, I do a bunch of:<br />
<br />
  CopyFiles &quot;$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil.bak&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil&quot;<br />
  ..<br />
  ..<br />
<br />
followed by:<br />
<br />
  Delete &quot;$INSTDIR/my/dir/my.fil.bak&quot;<br />
  ..<br />
  ..<br />
<br />
After the install is done, the .bak files are all still there.  The copies work, but the Deletes fail, even though the Deletes that uninstall the installed files work fine.  <br />
<br />
I tried putting &quot;sleep 5000&quot; between the copies and the deletes.  I tried moving the deletes to the un.onUninstSuccess function.  No luck.<br />
<br />
Is this a known issue?  Something silly I may be doing?  I am using NSIS 2.46 on WinXP Pro.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Old habits die hard.  That seems to have fixed it.  Odd that they work with CopyFiles, but not with Delete.  I moved to the &quot;copy-&gt;delete&quot; model after Rename failed.  Maybe that was the slashes too and it will work now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for catching that.  It was something silly I was doing after all.<br />
