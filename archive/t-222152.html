<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anup J Rao</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
 I recently started trying NSIS for the &quot;ProntoProEdit NG&quot; product being deployed by my company. I am very much impressed with it.<br />
<br />
I have however noticed two small issues, which i would like to fix. I am using Modern UI/InstallOptions for the setup being developed.<br />
<br />
The first issue is regarding the <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want to quit ProntoProEdit NG Setup?&quot; <br />
<br />
message which shows up on clicking the close button on the titlebar displayed on the finish page. I have noticed that this does not occur in the installers of several other software products using NSIS.<br />
<br />
How can I solve this?<br />
<br />
The second issue is regarding the display of icons on custom pages. I have two custom pages which have icons  refering to icons in a Resource folder. This resource folder is under the same folder where the setup is built. These icons are displayed when I run the setup from this location. But the same do not display when the setup is run from a different location. I believe i am incorrectly packing the icons in the installer. Kindly assist.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Anup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">1. remove the line !define MUI_ABORTWARNING from your script<br />
<br />
2. try writing the location of the icons to the ini of your io-page on runtime<br />
<br />
i.e. !insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE &quot;io.ini&quot; &quot;Field 1&quot; &quot;State&quot; &quot;$EXEDIR\MyIcon.ico&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anup J Rao</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
 Thanks for the prompt reply. These are my queries further to the problem mentioned earlier.<br />
<br />
1. The line !define MUI_ABORTWARNING seems to remove the warning from all pages. However, I am interested in removing it in the finish page only.<br />
<br />
2. I am interested in packing the icon into the Setup and then use it at run time.<br />
Do i have to extract the icon files to a folder?<br />
I am also curious to know which folder I must mention for InstallOption to pick these files from.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Anup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">22nd July 2005, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">if you want to use the icon of your installer, use the following code<br />
!include &quot;FileFunc.nsh&quot;<br />
!insertmacro GetExeName<br />
...<br />
${GetExeName} $R0<br />
!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_WRITE &quot;io.ini&quot; &quot;Field 1&quot; &quot;State&quot; &quot;$R0,0&quot;<br />
if you want to use any other icon you have to include it with the File/ReserveFile command and extract it to a folder of your choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anup J Rao</div><div class="date">25th July 2005, 06:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot for that help Yathosho.<br />
I was able to solve the Icon related issue.<br />
<br />
In reply to Stu, the cancel button used to appear on the finish page too. I had to hide it using the following code in the PreFinish function of the finish page.<br />
<br />
  GetDlgItem $1 $HWNDPARENT 2<br />
  ShowWindow $1 ${SW_HIDE}<br />
<br />
Is there a way to hide disable the 'X' button on the titlebar? or remove all the system buttons from it?<br />
<br />
