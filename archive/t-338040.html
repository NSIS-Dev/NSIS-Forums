<br />
I plan to have one installer for 32 &amp; 64 bit. So some files are redundant as in the following snippet:<br />
   SetOutPath c:/foo<br />
   File &quot;c:/bar/32bit/aha.exe<br />
   File &quot;c:/bar/64bit/aha.exe<br />
<br />
Depending to the value of ${RunningX64} the installer should installer only one of the files. Can't get that working - not possible or a thinking mistake ?<br />
<br />
Point is that a construct like<br />
    ${If} ${RunningX64}<br />
      File &quot;c:/bar/64bit/aha.exe<br />
    ${Else}<br />
in my installer includes only one file<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Uwe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for my cryptic example, I have used a correct If-Else-endIf Block. But I decided to double check and it seems to work as expected. What have puzzled me, was that the final installer always had the same size.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your food for thought<br />
Uwe</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is as it should be. Your installer needs to install properly on both x64 and x86 platforms, so it needs to carry both versions of your exe.<br />
<br />
The reason that this works is that file compression by the File command is executed at compile-time, while the x64 evaluation is runtime. So the compiler evaulates both File commands and compresses both exes into installer.exe.</div></div><hr />
