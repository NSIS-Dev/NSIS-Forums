<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenn5175</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so this is going to prompt people to write back saying &quot;read the documentation!&quot; but I am not understanding the process/purpose of using NSIS. When I make an installer, is this exe supposed to run on my PPC? Because when I run it on my PC it works fine but according to devbuzz.com I can use NSIS to make an installer for a PPC device. However, when I try to run the compiled install exe I get &quot;This is not a PPC application&quot;. Help! <br />
<br />
Here is my ultimate goal. I have a VS2003 application which runs on a PPC2003 iPaq 5550 device. It requires SQLClient, SQLCE, etc, to already be installed before the app can run. I am looking for a solution which can be carried on a storage card (there will be no PC onsite when these handhelds are setup). I need that solution to be an executable which first moves the 5 CAB files onto the device, then launches/installs them, then moves the main app onto the device and makes a shortcut in the start menu to that app.<br />
<br />
I found NSIS from DevBuzz (http://www.pocketpcdn.com/articles/multicabinstall.html) on how to run multiple cab files from a setup exe. But now I am SO confused as to how to compile an installer that works on a PPC rather than a PC. Does this product do what I need? If so, what am I doing wrong that it will only launch on a PC? Could it be that I have PPC2003 rather than a lesser version? <br />
<br />
Any point in the right direction would be much appreciated!<br />

Try the older 1.98 (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nsis/nsis198.exe?download) version.<br />
<br />
But thinking about it now, I'm not actually sure what you should do.<br />

<br />
Have you tried searching this forum too?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the script in that page you linked to, the installer should run on the computer the Pocket PC is connected to and not on the Pocket PC itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenn5175</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">So NSIS is not meant to build something which runs on the standalone device? Just want to be crystal clear. <br />
<br />
Does ANYONE know of any product which does not rely on the device being attached to a PC to run an install program that installs multiple cabs? The closest I have come is using a shell command to execute a cab - which results in a popup saying &quot;Double click the cab to run the application&quot; (no help). <br />
<br />
You guys have been doing this much longer than me, I'm sure - someone's gotta know SOMETHING!!! Help!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I have absolutely no idea wheather NSIS should work on any Pocket PC devices. I have never tried Pocket PC, read technical information about it or heard about NSIS used in it.<br />
<br />
Windows CE, however, looks very similar to normal Windows. Maybe NSIS will work on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By downloading the sample zip file from http://www.pocketpcdn.com/articles/MultiCabInstall.html, you can create a setup for multiple cab files to install on a Pocket PC device.<br />
<br />
By altering the test.nsi file to use your cab files and their corresponding ini files, the cab files will install on your connected device.  <br />
<br />
I altered the test.nsi file to install 5 different cab files on my device. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
