<br />
      Our game installer scripts were working fine with XP. However with vista they are creating installation problems. <br />
We are in trouble as we need to solve these issues very urgently. <br />
<br />
Is it because of not setting RequestExecutionLevel <br />
<br />
Can somebody correct us or show us were exactly we are wrong.<br />
The nsis game script can be downloaded from<br />
-http://www.kirkykitty.com/Vista.zip [Download size -1.42 MB]  <br />
<br />
Will eagerly look forward... <br />

I think a good start would be to actually explain the issues you are experiencing.  <br />
<br />
Thanks Backland,<br />
<br />
If we install this game on Vista, we can start and play all games. If we end the games (click on button &quot;Exit&quot;), the attached error will displayed: &quot;Malfunction installation of the program. Install it again.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Same display if we uninstall the games. After uninstall is complete, the error will displayed.<br />
<br />
Please check attached error.jpg showing a similar problem in  german version of script. <br />
Program compatibility assistant is showing this error popup <br />
<br />
Will look forward<br />
Ajish</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feel free to ask for any further clarifications<br />
Looking forward<br />

<br />
RequestExecutionLevel admin in your script<br />
<br />
That should be enough to fix it</div></div><hr />
