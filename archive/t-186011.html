<br />
As most of you know autorun only allows one executable to run. So I'm creating an NSIS autorun utility that runs multiple installs via autorun from a cd. Yes this is the client install and server install scenario.<br />
<br />
Well the child installers of course, may need to reboot the PC, but may not always be run via the autorun utility. Is there a way to supress the child nsis installers from displaying the reboot page if it was launched through the autorun interface described above; and at the same time informing the autorun utility that it will need to reboot the pc once all child nsis installers have executed? I'd like to do this without touching the registry.</div></div><hr />

When suppressed, you can write some registry value or write to a file, telling the autorun program whether a reboot is needed or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Kichik. That's exactly what I already have. It would be nice if there was a command, ie &quot;SetRebootParent&quot;, that would set the return code to 5 or something and not reboot the pc, then the parent nsis installer could trap the code and set the reboot flag, or once again pass it up again. This way the disk is never touched, the only downside I see at the moment would be if the final parent install didn't handle the reboot.<br />
<br />
Might be a very useful feature, that shouldn't be too hard to impliment into the code base.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
