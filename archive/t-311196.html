(This is the one where you have a 300 meg installer and running it with CRC on causes the &quot;Verifying installer...&quot; message).<br />
<br />
I have localization testers reporting that the message only shows up in English. Does anyone know if this message is localized?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">31st August 2009, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">no, it's not. you can change it using a reshacker, but it can only be one language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">31st August 2009, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, good to know. I will see if I can file that as a feature request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">31st August 2009, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">That message needs to be displayed BEFORE the lang tables have been extracted, this has been asked a million times already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">31st August 2009, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, I am not talking about something that the NSIS user would be able to change, but rather something that could be fixed intrinsically on the NSIS sfx side or whatever the code is that runs at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">31st August 2009, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">you can change it now, change the string in the source and recompile. If you don't want to recompile, you could probably hex edit the stubs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrushBug</div><div class="date">31st August 2009, 23:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand that those are the options. We are legally prohibited from downloading and using the source code at my company so that is not an option for us. Which is why I was hoping for there to be another solution that would show up in a future build.<br />
<br />
NSIS is an astounding product. We threw out our previous install solutions and switch to NSIS years ago and its support for localization and its ability to customize with NSIS scripting and plugins have solved every problem.<br />
<br />
So after a few years of telling our Loc department WNF (Will Not Fix) for the &quot;Verifying installer...&quot; string, I thought I would raise the issue.<br />
