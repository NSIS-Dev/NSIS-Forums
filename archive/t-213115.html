<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lornic</div><div class="date">13th April 2005, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I was having a problem with my application's install and after some heavy duty debugging, traced it to a bug in Library.nsh.  I have reported it as a bug on the SourceForge project (#1181951), but thought it a good idea to post information here for those who may also have been getting the problem.<br />
<br />
When installing a shared library for the first time on a system, Library.nsh was setting the error flag even though the library was registered Ok.<br />
<br />
Details of the source of the bug have been posted with the Bug Tracker record.  However, to fix it I have created an updated Library.nsh.</div></div><hr />
