<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tcaton</div><div class="date">9th November 2007, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I've got a directory structure like this (not really code, but preserves my spaces)...<br />
<br />
<br />
bin\<br />
   myapp.exe<br />
lib\<br />
src\<br />
include\<br />
tools\<br />
   installer.nsi<br />
   NSIS\<br />
      bin\<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, I have the following in my script (edited for brevity):<br />
<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Applications&quot; SEC01<br />
  File /r &quot;..\bin&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Given the location of the script (&quot;tools\&quot;), I would expect it to find and include only the &quot;bin&quot; directory at the root. However, it is also descending into the &quot;bin&quot; directory of the NSIS folder and collecting those files. As a quick test, I created another &quot;bin&quot; directory under &quot;include&quot;, which was also picked up. It appears that, even though I'm specifying what I think is a relative path to the top level &quot;bin&quot; directory only, the compiler is picking up any directory called &quot;bin&quot; that it encounters (odd, since no where am I telling it about the &quot;include&quot; directory -- not sure why it's even looking here).<br />
<br />
Am I not understanding how the compiler treats relative paths? Or is this a bug? Cheers,<br />
<br />

File /r &quot;..\bin\*.*&quot;<br />
