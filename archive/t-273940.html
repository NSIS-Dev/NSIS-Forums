<br />
I had a problem here. How do we write a registry with a password?<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\$RegistryName&quot; &quot;ObjectName&quot; &quot;Administrator&quot; <br />
<br />
I am able to write to the registry with Adminisrator profile but how do i set the password using NSIS, Password=&quot;System&quot;?<br />
<br />
Can I add the password to the registry?<br />
<br />
I had check in the registry, there is a folder with a key, name=&quot;security&quot;, type=&quot;REG_BINARY&quot;, Data=a lot of numbers.<br />
<br />
I think this is the password installed in the registry.<br />
<br />
Milliom thanks if you could help!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CancerFace</div><div class="date">6th July 2007, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You are trying to create entries for a service, something that can be done using differnet methods (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/How_do_I_start/stop/create/remove/check_a_service). The security value that you see is not a password and is system specific, it is created when you create a new service.<br />
<br />
The key you are looking at is also not correct as it reflects what can be found in HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\.... There may also be entries under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\LEGACY_... depending on the type of service created. It is best not make those entries by hand but to use some API function instead.<br />
<br />
Try the command line tool sc.exe that comes with windows. A simpesc.exe create /?will give you the syntax. It supports specifying an account and password for the new service.<br />
