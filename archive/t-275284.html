<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not specifically talking about Vista here, but about W2K &amp; XP<br />
<br />
The &quot;Run program&quot; option on the last page of the Modern UI is nice but if the computer's user has a limited account, he will likely have run the installer using a temporary administrator account<br />
(either by manually using the &quot;runas&quot; menu, or by having the installer being named &quot;install.exe&quot; or &quot;setup.exe&quot;)<br />
<br />
The problem is that the &quot;Run program&quot; option execute the program using the installer credentials, that is the temporary administrator account.<br />
So if the program starts to store data under %APPDATA% or in HKCU, this will be the wrong user space..<br />
<br />
I've been making research on Internet on how to solve this issue about running a non-admin program from an admin credentiels.<br />
The articles &amp; plugins I found so far seems to deal with DLL injection using hooks, but these don't work as SetWindowsHookEx don't work with processes from other users. (maybe those articles were Vista-related with the same user running elevated or not)<br />
The alternate solution could be to run an initial installer as non-admin and execute the admin install from here, but I wish to avoid this solution.<br />

It's implemented with the UAC plug-in but requires Vista specifics to elevate the second installer. I don't know of a better solution yet.</div></div><hr />
