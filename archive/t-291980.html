<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">18th May 2008, 23:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any secret to ensuring that the installed program, when launched from the installer, will open on top?  I frequently have to find the program's icon in the taskbar.  Probably 50% of the time my newly installed program appears as the top window, which I wish I could increase to 100%.</div></div><hr />

I know how I tell (or try to tell) my newly installed app to open on top in windows/C++, but in NSIS, where would I find the message that you mention?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">19th May 2008, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again.  I already call SetForegroundWindow in my app, so maybe I will try doing something with the installer, such as HideWindow.  But then again, maybe SetForegroundWindow called from the installer will be worth trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">19th May 2008, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">You look somehow confused SteveRussell.<br />
I guess it is a straight forward process, if you want to be 100% sure that your application is running in foreground when it is launched from the installer, you should tell the installer to set it as foreground. There is nothing you cannot do with nsis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">19th May 2008, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Red Wine, The thread you referred me to has apparently brought me 100% success.  From .onInstSuccess, FindWindow seems to go into an endless loop while searching for my window class, and I think it is due to the fact that this particular app quickly opens a modal dialog.  Neither class seems to satisfy FindWindow.  However, when I use the window title, all is well.<br />
<br />
I thank you once again for your invaluable help!  And I would be interested in your thoughts on my interpretation of the endless loop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveRussell</div><div class="date">20th May 2008, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the loop, the class fails for an installed app that doesn't open a modal dialog.  So obviously I have something to learn about using the class parameter, even though I borrowed it from Spy++.</div></div><hr />
