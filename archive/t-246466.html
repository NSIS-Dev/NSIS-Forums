<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ewallig</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Developer of a spreadsheet-based application now needs to upgrade his &quot;database&quot; structure. As part of the upgrade, he needs to capture all of the currently stored data in the previous version of his app. To do this, he's built another spreadsheet with a bunch of macros in it. This spreadsheet needs to be launched and then closed once it has completed its task (get the data and then save the data as a text file).<br />
<br />
The installer that I built for him now needs to do the following:<br />
<br />
 - Launch the macro-loaded spreadsheet<br />
 - Close the macro-loaded spreadsheet once it has created its text file.<br />
 - Proceed with the installation of the rest of the upgraded files.<br />
<br />
To tackle this, I wrote a small script that checks for the presence of the text file and loops until it exists. In the installer, I run this script (actually a script inside of an exe wrapper) after launching the macro-loaded spreadsheet. Once it detects the text file, it sends various keystrokes to click a dialog box that pops up and then close the spreadsheet. Once the macro-loaded spreadsheet closes, the installation can proceed.<br />
<br />
The helper script works fine if I manually run the macro-loaded spreadsheet and then run the script; the text file is created and the macro-loaded spreadsheet closes w/o issue. However, I've run into some difficulties when trying to do this via the NSIS installer. If I use an Exec command to try to open the macro-loaded spreadsheet, there is no interaction w/ the desktop which the script needs to do the keystrokes. If I use an ExecShell open, then the installer stalls once the macro-loaded spreadsheet opens up - no further installer-related activity occurs until I manually click the button on the dialog box.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this - the developer really wants it to be automatic and is giving me a bit of grief over it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

It'd also allow you greater control with direct API instead of keystrokes. You can use the System plug-in to do that or create a simple plug-in for the task.</div></div><hr />

Sites like code project (http://www.codeproject.com) might contain more examples. A simple search for &quot;Excel&quot; comes up with many results.</div></div><hr />
