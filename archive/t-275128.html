<br />
I am working on the ModernUI components page and I am trying to add a button, or even a link, called 'Details' to the current display. Basically, what we are trying to do is have a basic installation with as few necessary clicks as possible, but we want the user to be able to click this 'Details' button to bring up another page, such as the license page, which will have details about the program being installed. When the user closes this second page, it will go right back to the components page.<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
a) Is there a way to add an additional button to the bottom of the components page that I can use in this capacity. (If not, I can attempt to create my own custom components page.)<br />
<br />
b) I can make a function (showPage) that will call up this page, but how can I add the code to this new button or link that will call function showPage?<br />
<br />
I have searched the documentation and I haven't seen anything like this. Am I trying to do something that is outside the intent of the installer?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
-Mike</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">30th July 2007, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Add the button to UIs\modern.exe (make a copy of it, modify it with Resource Hacker, then use !define MUI_UI modern_modified.exe).<br />
2. Use the ButtonEvent plug-in (from the Wiki) to make the button call a function.<br />
3. In that function, set a temporary variable (say $9) to 1 and then <br />
!define WM_NOTIFY_OUTER_NEXT 0x408<br />
SendMessage $HWNDPARENT ${WM_NOTIFY_OUTER_NEXT} 1 0<br />
This will make the custom button act as a Next button.<br />
4. Place your custom 'details' page after the components page and in its show function (Page Custom ShowFunc LeaveFunc), call Abort if your temporary variable ($9) does not equal 1 (StrCmp) to skip the page.<br />

I attempted this and it worked perfectly. It was exactly what we were trying to do.</div></div><hr />
