<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">repuust</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to do something which I assume is simple, but can't find any tutorial or help on it.  All I want to do is have some sort of log file that is generated on install.  It implies that if I use DetailPrint messages and then use SetDetailsPrint both, I would get some sort of log file.<br />
<br />
1) Is this correct?<br />
2) Where is this log file?<br />
3) Can I call the file something else and/or change the path?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">From the NSIS manual :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
4.9.12.1 LogSet<br />
<br />
on|off<br />
<br />
Sets whether install logging to $INSTDIR\install.log will happen. $INSTDIR must have a value before you call this function or it will not work. Note that the NSIS_CONFIG_LOG build setting must be set (scons NSIS_CONFIG_LOG=yes) on compile time (it is not by default) to support this. See Building NSIS for more information about recompiling NSIS.<br />
<br />
People seem to hate the manual :cry:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">repuust</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help.  Trust me, I went through the manual a dozen times, but couldn't find anything.  Everything I found implied that SetDetailsPrint was the way to do logging, not downloading a specialized build and using LogText.  Heck, if you type &quot;logging&quot; into the NSIS User Manual, LogSet never even comes up!  I still don't even understand what SetDetailsPrint both is supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the output generated by LogText seems to be too verbose for my needs.  I use the XML library which seems to generate about 300 &quot;Jump: 224&quot;.  Plus, I want to have a log file for install and un-install.  I will probably just roll my own macro that writes to a file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoRd_MuldeR</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">DetailPrint will write a line to the installer screen, that's the listbox the user will see during install. You can make the text appear right over the listbox only (textonly), you can add a new line to the listbox only (listonly), or you can add a line to listbox *plus* make that new line appear right over the listbox (both). Note that the text label right over the listbox will *always* be visible, while the listbox itself is hidden unless the user clicks &quot;Show Details&quot;. Hope it's clear now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I also think there is a plugin that will &quot;suck out&quot; the information that displayed during install.  You could take that data, and write it to a file...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">repuust</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks LoRd_MuldeR.  This back and forth actually got me to a point I'm happy.  I hadn't set AutoCloseWindow false, so my install/un-install messages weren't being displayed to the user long enough to be useful.  I think I'm going to put everything useful into that window for now.  Work on persisting the information another day.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help.</div></div><hr />
