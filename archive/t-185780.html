<br />
Hum, did you check the AdvSplash readme (Contrib\AdvSplash\advsplash.txt)? There is the following code in it, did you try it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
  SetOutPath $TEMP<br />
  File /oname=spltmp.bmp &quot;my_splash.bmp&quot;<br />
<br />
; optional<br />
; File /oname=spltmp.wav &quot;my_splashshit.wav&quot;<br />
<br />
  advsplash::show 1000 600 400 -1 $TEMP\spltmp<br />
<br />
  Pop $0 ; $0 has '1' if the user closed the splash screen early,<br />
         ; '0' if everything closed normal, and '-1' if some error occured.<br />
<br />
  Delete $TEMP\spltmp.bmp<br />
;  Delete $TEMP\spltmp.wav<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, then to play some music during the whole installation, check the plugin 'BgImage', there is a .txt and a nice example in 'Contrib\BgImage' ..<br />
<br />
Hope you'll make it :)<br />

Hmmmm.... I don't trust much the Windows API's for that purpose. I think it's better using a plugin, like BASS which was said on that thread you linked.<br />

You should say your NSIS, Windows versions first. You only need to attach the script if you think it's a script problem, because it should work.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, someone should create a Archive page of this issue of playing music. I don't create one because I don't like the Archive at all.</div></div><hr />

Looking from my corner Video for Windows Win API is good enough for WAVE files, MSDN declares it's support beginning Win95 :)<br />
<br />
  Windows NT: Requires version 3.1 or later.<br />
  Windows: Requires Windows 95 or later.<br />
  Windows CE: Requires version 2.0 or later.<br />
  Header: Declared in mmsystem.h.<br />
  Import Library: Use winmm.lib.<br />
<br />
mp3 files - this depends... :)<br />
<br />
Problems with splash plugin were on Win98 SE. Bitmap OK, sound :( And I guess any case plugin for wav file increases installation size only. I tested my script on Win98/W2K/XP and it worked fine. The only problem was with sound file extraction to plugins dir on Win98 (file /oname, cannot open file for write error), but after I did it in 2 lines with SetOutPath this is OK. Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It works fine with the BgImage!<br />
All i had to do was put this code in the .onInit function:<br />
<br />
InitPluginsDir<br />
BgImage::Sound /NOUNLOAD /LOOP &quot;path of the wav file&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Does anybody knows how to remove the label &quot;Nullsoft Install System v2.0&quot; on the bottom of each installation window ???<br />
Is this allowed to do?<br />
<br />
Thanks all<br />

<br />
<br />
BrandingText /TRIMRIGHT &quot;WHAT YOU WANT HERE&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
you can also replace /TRIMRIGHT to /TRIMLEFT or /TRIMCENTER</div></div><hr />
