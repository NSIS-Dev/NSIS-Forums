<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">okapi</div><div class="date">30th August 2002, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if there was a way to implement the same functionality of a section divider while using the new 2.0 versions that no longer support this. I liked having a line between some sections when selecting sections to install.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

It will require to draw the tree manually unless there is some magic way to do this that I am not familiar with. If anyone knows such a way, please share.</div></div><hr />

e.g. adding a command like SectionsStyle (w/ parameters Separate or Tree)<br />

Is possible, but it's a lot of work. Using SubSections, there is also a good separation.</div></div><hr />

Both are still coded, each parameter could link to the corresponding code...<br />
Tell me if I'm wrong</div></div><hr />

New systems such as the mouseover for descriptions need to be integrated in the old system. And it adds extra overhead. What's the problem with SubSections?</div></div><hr />

Ok thx for the reply, I have nothing against treeview, it's just in order I undertand why it is not possible (and trying to help okapi)... <br />
It's always possible, but it adds extra overhead (or it should be made optional so you need to recompile), and I don't think that it will be used by other people :)<br />
<br />
I don't know what okapi has against treeview (maybe he doesn't even know yet that there are subsections :D).</div></div><hr />
