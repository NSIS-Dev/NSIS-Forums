<br />
I have two icons, one for the uninstaller and one for the installer. But the compiler states that there is a mismatch. They both are XP icons, meaning they range from 16x16 to 48x48 at the usual colors (16, 256..)<br />
<br />
So what does the docs mean when it states that:<br />
Note that if you use different icons for installer and uninstaller the file size and structure of the icons has to match otherwise the build of your installer will fail. <br />
<br />
1. Filesize?? How can the filesize be equal to each other when there are different amounts of colors?<br />
<br />
2. Structur, meaning there has to be the same 'types' of icons?<br />
<br />
I need some understanding and coding help here, hope you guys can. Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The two icon files must contain the same number of icons, in the same sizes and with the same number of colors (and I think the order within the file has to be the same too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatsudoshi</div><div class="date">18th November 2004, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that was I figured too and about the filesize, then it has nothing to do with the contents of the icon file at all. The size is set by the number and type of icons in the icon file.<br />
Well thanks for the answer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">19th November 2004, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the docs say the structure (i.e. the grid size and the colour depth) has to be the same, so I think they're pretty accurate. Doesn't mention actual contents of the icon re what colour goes in what square.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatsudoshi</div><div class="date">25th November 2004, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if the point of view is that the user of the docs already knows what the docs are talking about, then yes. But for the N'th % of the public that does not know how icons are made up, the docs does not give enough help. It would take 3-4 more lines to tell what is meant by 'structure' so again, it is a matter of what point of view we are talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">25th November 2004, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">How about:Sets the icon of the installer. Every icon in the icon file will be included in the installer. Note that if you use an uninstaller, each icon in the icon file must have the same size and color depth as its matching icon in the uninstaller icon file. The order of the icons in the icon file also matters. For example, if the installer icon file has three icons, first icon sized 32x32 pixels with 8bpp, second icon sized 16x16 pixels with 8bpp and third icon sized 8x8 with 8bpp; then the uninstaller icon file must have three icons with the same sizes and color depths, in the same order.?</div></div><hr />
