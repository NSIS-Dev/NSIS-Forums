<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure it's just my frustration talking but I have been getting the impression lately that the NSIS docs have been written by people who somehow knew in advance what I'd need to know and adjusted the docs accordingly so they don't tell me.<br />
<br />
My problem is this: I am using the MUI, and want a branding image stuck on the side of the installer, for every screen. Could someone clearly state (not just for me, but for the record) the steps involved in doing this. <br />
<br />
I have tried putting stuff in .onGUIInit, which results in the branding appearing WAY after the GUI is Inited, and the forum posts on how to get the thing to appear (apparently you need to add in a statement for every page of the installer...) seem less than clear.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much in advance guys, my complaining is only temporary, whereas my love for NSIS and you all is undying.</div></div><hr />

So to make a decent Wizard I suggest you to drop that idea.<br />
LOL2k!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">25th November 2004, 09:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that (handily) only uses custom Pages, which means that the code can simply be included in functions. My case (which I think is a slightly more real-world one) is that I want to know where I can put code which will be called by the standard MUI pages (e.g. MUI_PAGE_WELCOME, MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY).<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE function<br />
MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_SHOW function<br />
MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_LEAVE function<br />
<br />
One of THEM!</div></div><hr />
