<br />
I tried searching for the information on this simple task, but was stunned by scarcity of NSIS documentation about the issue or my inability to find it, for that matter.<br />
<br />
How can one accomplish to set a colour that would fill the background of the window (all installer pages) and possibly set a picture on top of that colour (somewhere in the centre of the window perhaps)?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance!</div></div><hr />
