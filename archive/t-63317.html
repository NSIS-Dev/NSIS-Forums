<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">21st October 2001, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">i need help with my nsis gui, slate blue.  it is becoming way too much work for me to finish by myself, within a reasonable timeframe.  below is a list of things that i can use help on:<br />
<br />
using vc++ to allow the NSIS DLL written by pjw (i believe) to send the status text to my program, or to write it to a .txt file so i can load it into my program.  also allow my program to compile nsis scripts quickly and easily with the dll. (slate blue is written in vb).<br />
then there's just help with the program; a better way to parse scripts, layout ideas, etc.<br />
<br />
let me know,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">21st October 2001, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I could modify the dll so that it simply logs to the handle of a supplied edit window, rather than having the callback function.<br />
<br />
Included in the newest dll downloadable is a function <br />
'int Process_Script_Param(char *filename, char *defines, BOOL SetDir, BOOL do_config, LPARAM lParam);<br />
<br />
if you give lParam the valid handle of an edit window, the output will be logged to there.. (ala makenwin as included in the download).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">22nd October 2001, 06:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I was trying to go to COMDEX this year to learn C-bang (C# - microsoft's new programming language). But it is only $800.00!!!! But I may not go. UNLESS, they had an educational discount :P<br />
<br />
But no matter what, I would be glad to help. duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net is my e-mail address. e-mail me with what I could do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgewize</div><div class="date">22nd October 2001, 06:32</div></div><div class="posttext">That's C-sharp, not C-bang :)  C-bang would be &quot;C!&quot;<br />
<br />
And I would stay away from it if I were you.  It's basically Java, but without the cross-platform compatibility.  Microsoft got its official Java license revoked so they put out their own similar language instead.<br />
<br />
Don't buy into their sinister schemes to corrupt the free programmers of the world!</div></div><hr />

So perhaps I could write a new parser... not sure if it's needed, because I haven't looked at any code, but it's possible.<br />
I don't have a lot of time at the moment though - in 2 weeks I'll know if I have the time to do it.</div></div><hr />
