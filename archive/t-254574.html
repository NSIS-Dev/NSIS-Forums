<br />
Somebody help me please! I've got a non-WHQL FTDI driver. I'd like to write an NSIS silent driver installer. I preinstalled the driver (SetupCopyOEMInf), but when I plugged the USB device to the computer the system started the New hardware wizard program. When I clicked Next...Next...etc. buttons the system found the INF file (in the driver store) and installed the driver. How can I hide the New hardware wizard? I know that under the installation process the system show a warning message because the driver hasn't got WHQL sign.<br />
<br />
Thx!<br />

<br />
I am having the same problem with a USB driver I have installed. I have not found the answer yet, but I did find this -<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are some of my USB devices reinstalled when they are moved to a new USB port?<br />
<br />
In Windows 2000 and later operating systems, a new physical device object (PDO) is created when a device (for example, a USB or PCMCIA device) is moved from one port to another. A new PDO is not created if the hardware reports a unique USB serial number.<br />
<br />
To reuse the same PDO and to ensure that the device experience is unchanged whether the device is reinserted into the same port or a new port, hardware vendors must store a serial number on their device. According to the requirements of the &quot;Designed for Windows&quot; logo program, the serial number must be unique for all devices that share the same device installation identifier.&quot;<br />

<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
P.S. I have not tested this yet!!</div></div><hr />
