<br />
At present our installer has the ability to uninstall a previously installed version. The process is as follows:<br />
<br />
Current state = application already installed.<br />
<br />
(1) User double-clicks our exe.<br />
(2) Dialog appears saying application is already installed, and then says please wait whilst the application is being uninstalled, user presses [OK]<br />
(3) Uninstall wizard appears.<br />
<br />
From here there is 2 different routes &quot;next&quot; and &quot;cancel&quot;<br />
<br />
[next]<br />
Application uninstalls and then installs. Everythings good.<br />
<br />
[Cancel]<br />
The uninstaller cancels but then the installer wizard appears and providing the user clicks [next] we install over whats already there leaving the application in a funny state.<br />
<br />
Is there a way around this problem?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">14th July 2008, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The best way is probably just to add a check just after the uninstall is called to make sure it actually uninstalled the application.  If not, display a message to the user and quit.  (Use ExecWait to make sure it waits for the uninstall to complete before doing the check.)<br />
<br />
Your uninstall check could be something like checking for the presence of an old EXE, verifying a registry key, etc.<br />
<br />
This would have the added benefit of stopping the installation if some other glitch happened that prevented the application from properly uninstalling.</div></div><hr />
