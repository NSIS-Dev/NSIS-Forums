<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jrhutch</div><div class="date">14th April 2008, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a problem getting NSIS to copy files from a network directory. I think the problem may be that the shared folder contains the $ character.<br />
<br />
Here is an example of what I'm doing:<br />
<br />
There are two machines on a local network, one is the master, and one is a secondary machine. The master machine has it's software updated normally, and the secondary machine just needs to pull the same files over the network.  The master machine has it's 'D' drive shared as 'D$'<br />
<br />
I have tried all of the following:<br />
<br />
CopyFiles &quot;\\MasterComputer\d$$\dir\*.*&quot; d:\SecondaryDir<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;xcopy \\MasterComputer\d$$\dir\*.* d:\SecondaryDir&quot;<br />
<br />
nsExec::ExecToStack &quot;$SYSDIR\xcopy.exe&quot; &quot;\\MasterComputer\d$$\dir\*.*&quot; &quot;d:\SecondaryDir&quot;<br />
<br />
And none of them will copy any files. I know the SecondaryDir is created beforehand, it just won't copy the files there. What am I doing wrong? Am I not able to do name resolution in NSIS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, the solution is probably:StrCpy $0 \\mastercomputer\d$$<br />
CopyFiles $0\dir\*.* d:\sec</div></div><hr />
