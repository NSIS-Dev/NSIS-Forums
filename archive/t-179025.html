<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abrogard</div><div class="date">5th May 2004, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I use software to check all registry changes when installing software I've downloaded and want to check out.<br />
Then when I unload them and throw them away as I do with 90% of them I try to clean up after them and remove all traces.<br />
But I can't do that. It's obvious that some of them know they've been here before. So they must have left something behind, somewhere.<br />
How do they do that? What do they leave?</div></div><hr />

I think you should report it to a moderator and I'll repost it somewhere else. The moderator will remove it. I can't see how I can remove it.<br />
<br />
In fact I'll go repost it now - (probably get a complaint I'm posting twice).</div></div><hr />
