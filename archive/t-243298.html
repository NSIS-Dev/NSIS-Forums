<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">12th April 2006, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that the Basque and Welsh NLF files are missing from the NSIS 2.16 setup, even though the files are there in CVS.<br />
However, the MUI NSH files are included in the setup.<br />
Basque was introduced for NSIS 2.16, but Welsh seemed to have been introduced in May 2005 and its NLF file has never been included in the NSIS setup.<br />
I am also filing this in the Sourceforge bug tracker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correction: the Basque and Welsh MUI NSH files are NOT included, either.</div></div><hr />
