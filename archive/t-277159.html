<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisywheel</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I added inetc::get call in .onInit function. After that my installer starts as not active application (it appears in task bar but as not selected). Installer's window appears behind another windows. I have to click in task bar to make it active. <br />
<br />
Does anybody have idea what is the reason?<br />
How can I fix it or workaroud?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Use forum search to get all threads. Problem appears because installer not created it's first window on launch (silent inetc request). If you want keep this behaviour the only &quot;good&quot; way is temporary set installer window active and topmost, but you must do this when installer is already visible (and I don't know where to add this code)...</div></div><hr />
