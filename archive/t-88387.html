To answer your question: yes, the original and target file can be different sizes (you can even have multiple old versions which are patched into one new version, but that's just batch generation).<br />
I would like to warn you about a bug somewhere in the GUI: When loading and saving, the patches aren't properly cached.<br />
Basically I would recommend to select the files you want to generate patches for, save the project, and generate them - do not save anymore once the patches, but restart instead and load your project. At least, that's the bug IIRC (I don't know exactly when it happens so I haven't fixed it). Glad to know someone actually uses it besides me ;)</div></div><hr />
