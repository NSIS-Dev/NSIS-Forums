<br />
I've developped an application which users the MSXML4.DLL. How can I include this file in the installer? As i've read in other posts you have to use re-distributables. But I can't find a redistributable for MSXML (in DLL format, i only find the one with MSM files)<br />
<br />
What options are there to install MSXML via my NSIS script?<br />
And if there's more than one suggestion which one is the most preferable?<br />
<br />
Tnx in advance for the answers !<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biggena</div><div class="date">13th March 2006, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Find following files in your System32 directory:<br />
msxml4.dll, msxml4a.dll, msxml4r.dll<br />
<br />
Copy them into directory of your installator script.<br />
Add following lines to your script (inside corresponding section):<br />
<br />
SetOutPath $SYSDIR<br />
SetOverwrite off<br />
<br />
File msxml4.dll<br />
File msxml4a.dll<br />
File msxml4r.dll<br />
RegDLL $SYSDIR\msxml4.dll<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
SetOverwrite ifnewer<br />
<br />
Above lines will install and register MSXML if it doesn't exist on system yet.</div></div><hr />

My first thought was also doing this but other posts in this forum mentioned not to use the dll's from my system32 folder since these ones are only compatbile with the OS that's on my system.<br />
<br />
I think this is a solution but i'm wondering if it's a good one.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

There are multiple free, portable XML parsers. Yahoo have Javascript ones, dotGNU have one, just Google.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th March 2006, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">tcdmail, you can install the MSM using msiexec.exe. You can create a simple MSI, with WiX for example, that'll only install your MSM and install that. Search the forum for more details.</div></div><hr />

I would also like more information on this.<br />
<br />
What about instead of using the 3 dll files from the system32 folder, would it be possible to use the same 3 dll files that can be extraced from the msxmlcab.exe (downloadable here (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3144b72b-b4f2-46da-b4b6-c5d7485f2b42&amp;DisplayLang=en#filelist))?<br />
<br />
Surely then these dlls can be used on whatever Win OS they're deployed onto using the RegDLL command in the NSIS sctipt?</div></div><hr />

If their installer only installs those files, I don't see a reason why it shouldn't work, assuming the DLLs are not protected.</div></div><hr />
