<br />
Does anyone have a copy of this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know the specific code but instead you can use NSISdl (NSIS extension DLL) to download files from the internet, and use them in your installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CodeSquid</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I've finished writing an NSIS script which can download files from the net. It first downloads a mirror list, then chooses one random mirror, downloads a zip file and extracts it. It is also possible to specify a local package directory where the downloaded files will be stored so that you don't have to redownload the files when you reinstall.<br />
The script uses the following extension DLLs:<br />
NSISdl, InstallOptions and ZipDLL (http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/ZipDll) and can only be compiled by NSIS 2.0a4 or later with enabled NSIS_CONFIG_PLUGIN_SUPPORT<br />
(BTW kichik, if you read this, why is this switch disabled by default again?)<br />
<br />
Currently the script can only be downloaded here:<br />
http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/<br />
It's located in the install folder of of FileZilla_2_0_0_beta_5a_src.zip<br />
To see the script in action, download and run the setup program from the same page and select the &quot;Source Code&quot; component.<br />
<br />
The only thing that is missing in my script is automatic mirror switching on failure.</div></div><hr />

In the CVS it is now enabled by default since people seem to like it and it seems to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I have enabled it back just now... I haven't finished optimizing it though. It should be ready tomorrow to ship happily with alpha 5 :D</div></div><hr />
