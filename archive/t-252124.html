<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">b0wnage</div><div class="date">28th July 2006, 03:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Im just trying to put together an installation file that contains numerous Setup.exe files I.E. &quot;Bitcomet, Nero, McAfee, Winamp Etc..&quot; For my home PC's and when i goto a friends or what not, Basicaly i want to run a single Setup.exe that contains the other setup.exe files in it, And have some sort of selection screen for which Setup.exe files to run or even run each setup.exe in a list, Like once the main setup.exe starts it will install Bitcomet and then after it will Install Winamp and so on.<br />
<br />
Well if anyone here knows of a way i can accomplish this then it would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
-Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">28th July 2006, 04:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way would be to create a separate section for each installation you wanted to run.  Then, display the components page and allow the user to check whichever combination is desired.  Then, in the sections, you just launch each additional setup using ExecWait commands.<br />
<br />
Have a look a the docs and examples included with NSIS for more information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wondering if anyone knew an easy way this could be done.<br />
Thanks for your help though. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Section &quot;Bitcomet&quot;<br />
 ExecWait ...<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Nero&quot;<br />
 ExecWait ...<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
And so on. It really is that simple, almost. You'd just need to add some Section descriptions if you're using Modern UI (see Examples\Modern UI\*)<br />
