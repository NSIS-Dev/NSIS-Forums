<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MidnightJava</div><div class="date">1st July 2007, 06:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I use InstallOptions to set some fields on the Finish page in the &quot;pre&quot; Finish function, and I read the values set by the user in the &quot;leave&quot; Finish function. Up to here, it works fine. But depending on what values I read in the &quot;leave&quot; Finish function, I'd like to write an additional label field to the Finish page, to tell the user that what they selected will take a while, so they don't wonder for several seconds why the Finish page is not disappearing.<br />
<br />
I think I read somewhere that you can't write to the Finish page after it's been displayed. Indeed, what I'm trying to do is not working- the extra label never shows up. Is there a way to do what I'm trying to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">1st July 2007, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">To modify the finish page on leave you have to use SendMessage with the appropriate message (defined in WinMessages.nsh) and then call Abort. There are hundreds of examples of this.<br />
I don't think what you want to do will work because you aren't calling Abort. It'd be better to just display a banner with the Banner plugin.<br />
