But I want a msi file. By just changing the file extension, msiexec doesn't recognize the package, saying it is not a valid package.<br />
<br />
I tried to use msiexec to avoid the UAC prompt on Vista.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madden</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the supported installer output format (.exe/.msi) should be clearly stated in the product documentation. Or at least in the FAQ.<br />
<br />
I just had to read the product help's table of contents, the product features list, the FAQ and the forums just to find I should not expect .msi output from NSIS.<br />
<br />
A search or index lookup in the product's .chm file simply shows nothing on &quot;msi&quot;. A simple note saying at least &quot;only .exe is supported&quot; would be nice.<br />
<br />
The main features of .msi are the automated rollback it provides in case of errors or user canceling or when uninstalling, and the .msm format for merge modules which is rather standard for installing third-party libraries now. In NSIS you have to actually check for errors and script any rollback explicitly, and .msm files can be installed with NSIS with some tricks, but it should have built-in support for them. And for .msi output if possible ...<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
MSI (Microsoft Installer Package) is not an installer. MSI files are packages that contains installation information for the Windows Installer engine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madden</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course.<br />
<br />
But I would still like to see this information in the product's documentation instead of searching forums on the internet for it ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS and MSI (and Inno) are entirely different things. It doesn't make any sense to name all the things that some application is NOT. Would you expect Microsoft to add a disclaimer in the Microsoft Windows Vista manual stating that &quot;this software is not a Macintosh operating system&quot;? Or a bottle of milk stating &quot;Note: this bottle does not contain Coca Cola&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizou</div><div class="date">29th December 2009, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. Personnally I agree that this information could be added to the documentation. MSI packages are becoming quite common in the world of Windows..<br />
So we can expect this type of question from people looking for an installer system and comparing them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madden</div><div class="date">30th December 2009, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">At least a note under OutFile or in the features list saying Currently the NSIS compiler can only create an installer as an executable program.</div></div><hr />
