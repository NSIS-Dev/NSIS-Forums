<br />
Yet another problem with my installer :/<br />
On Win2K everything works fine - but not on XP.<br />
I get an error when it tries to load nsPerl.dll from the temp directory: &quot;Error loading C:\Documents...\myprofile\Local Se...\Temp\nsr2B.tmp\nsPerl.dll&quot;<br />
I checked the temp dir, the file is there.<br />
<br />
The installer requires admin-rights and checks for thos .onInit - therefor I think this shouldn't be the problem.<br />
Any ideas about this?<br />
Or any chances to get a more specific error message from the installer?<br />
<br />
As side info, I use Perl to search and replace in some text files with regular expressions, afaik this isn't possible with pure NSIS, right?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
To replace strings in a file, use the functions available in the included headers.<br />

On my Win2K-sys I have Perl installed - that was why I didn't get errors.<br />
<br />
I can't use the included functions because I need a complete set of regular expressions.<br />
Perl offers me this - and if it's only the 800kb extra space I choose this as the simplest way.<br />
<br />
Thank you for making things clear, now my installer works fine so far :)</div></div><hr />

Oh, OK, that was the issue - perhaps this should be explicitly mentioned on the nsPerl wiki pages. It's a wiki page. Go right ahead :)</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind I'm speaking German generally.</div></div><hr />
