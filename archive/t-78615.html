It's been out of development for some time as far as I can tell, but I really liked where it was going.  A few more touch ups, and it would have been a great idea for controlling build types and such (I'd still use vim for all of my source editing).<br />
<br />
I hope some word comes of it.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps, anybody know another decent GUI?<br />

I havent released more versions yet, because there was absolutely no reaction on my first release in this forum and I dont want to obtrude myself or my software to this community.<br />
The current version has 107.235 Bytes (as .zip) and thats already to big for an attachment in this formum :-/</div></div><hr />

Here is a version w/o installer (which makes the archive small enough for an attachment in this forum), just decompress it in your NSISplus folder.<br />
<br />
Again, any comments are welcome.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it appears they occur when I click pretty much anything.  They say &quot;Cant  find this pattern as page.  Do you like to perform a full text search?&quot; and there are yes and no buttons.<br />

<br />
Maybe you dont have extraced the archive with the included paths, so that the new help.txt is now located in your NSISplus folder but not in the data folder (where it belongs).<br />
<br />
If this is not the reason, it would help if you can tell me on what item you clicked to get that message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Scott <br />
Then just move the nsisplus/help.txt to nsisplus/data/help.txt.<br />
The mentioned box appears every time you click on an item whose description is missing in help.txt; the V0.90 help.txt contains every command that is documentd in makensis.htm, so a description of &quot;!define&quot; is included and the box can only appear if the current help.txt was not loaded.<br />
<br />
I had a look at the source anyhow, and the box is gone now, because the fulltext search is very fast and for that it is now performed w/o asking the user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the ability to, on a configuration basis, set which executable to attempt to build with.  For example, I have several different builds of makensis.exe and I want to use different ones for different configurations.<br />

Can you explain why you would like to use other compilers than the latest ones?<br />
I assume that you have seen the &quot;use bz2&quot; switch, usable for every configuration:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using different builds of NSIS is good because I have custom versions of it.  For example, right now, I have the standard build, the bz2 build, and two other builds that I use for various software distributions that don't have some of the features compiled into them that I never use, so that it makes my software distribution smaller.  Being able to set which one I use (so I don't have to always use the default or bz2, which are both bigger than I need to use.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense?<br />

So, we're talking about making things faster and easier?<br />
OK, I've just implemented a &quot;make all&quot; functionality, compiling all your configurations with one mouseclick:)<br />
But I am curious: what kind of project needs 20 different configurations?<br />

How many bytes you can save with your selfmade compilers?<br />
But its OK, you shall have your custom compiler option for every configuration in the next release (its already implemented).</div></div><hr />

The language distributions for StrokeIt, most likely.  They all use the exact same installer source, but include different files based on a define, which is set on the command line parameter.  :)<br />

BTW: very nice tool :)<br />
Will there be an update soon, fixing the small bugs?<br />
<br />

Well, I am a dialup user :)<br />
The last version I have downloaded was about 97KB - I had downloaded it even if it had 200KB.<br />
OK OK, more obejctive argument: an empty NSIS installer is about 30 KB so I assume that you can save about 15KB in the best case.<br />
That will make a difference of less than a minute in download time (analog modem), while it takes you hours to create a custom compiler<br />
every time NSIS is updated :)<br />
<br />
OK, now that your ideas are fulfilled, are there more wishes/comments?</div></div><hr />

200k would have taken twice as long.  :)  Its worth the time for me to make all of my software as small and fast as possible to provide my users with the best experience they could possibly have.<br />

Nah, not hours.  Maybe a half hour at best, because I always play with all the options again trying to get the filesize down some more.  :)<br />
<br />
But again, it's worth it to me to spend the time to make a better experience for my users.<br />

Sorry, but none of the bugs is really reproducable; is there an option to enable the writing of a logfile?<br />
<br />
<br />
[QUOTE]Its worth the time for me to make all of my software as small and fast as possible to provide my users with the best experience they could possibly have. <br />
Well, then you should think about including the &quot;how to stroke...&quot; docs instead of saving a few bytes in the installer, because your dialup users will take more time with dialing up again and saving the web page than with downloading additional 1-2KB with the installer;)<br />

Well, I havent thought of this yet, since there where no reaction on NSISplus at all in this forum so far.<br />
Most of the displayed text (online help, documentation) comes in ASCII form, so you should have no problems translating this; if you are willing to do this, I'll be happy to include you work in future updates of NSISplus.<br />

As I said, most of the text to translate is the online help (data/help.txt) and the docu (nsisplus.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to include them in resource section for the next release (easier for me hey ;) )?<br />
<br />
In the next version you will get all the text used by menus, dialogues, MessageBoxes etc. in a separate ASCII file, which will enable you to translate all the text once (instead of re translate all the resouces for every update).<br />
Most of the code needed for this new feature is already implemented :)<br />
<br />
<br />

Thats correct, the project tree adjusts the other views but will be (nearly) never adjusted by other views.<br />
Visual Studio does it the same way.</div></div><hr />
