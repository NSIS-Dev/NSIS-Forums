I have searched, but the keywords are fairly generic, so apologies if I missed a previous answer.<br />
Anyhow.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to make a 1-click install for our program - IE, no interraction from our users.<br />
<br />
Problem is, each install needs to be customised for each user:  Specifically, a file [server.ini] that is present in the package, needs to have the client's username + password embedded in it.<br />
<br />
So my question: Are there any ways to achieve this?<br />
If we're looking for a 1click install, we don't want to prompt the user for their UN/PW.<br />
<br />
So, I guess we're left with two situations:<br />
1- Make the configuration changes on the server, compile the exe, and then supply it to the user. Problem is, we're running linux boxes, not windows<br />
<br />
2- Do the configuration changes on the client's end - somehow passing their username and password with the DL, so the installer can make the changes. However, I can't seem to think of any reliable method to do this (short of embedding their username in the installer name, ie &quot;install-[username].exe&quot;. <br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas, I'd be greatly appreciative!<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
