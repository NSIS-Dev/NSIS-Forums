<br />
I have an installation that needs to have some of the files not visible as being extracted.  I do however want the user to see the files that are relevant to their installation.  Here's the scenario:<br />
<br />
File &quot;foo.exe&quot;<br />
File &quot;bar.exe&quot;<br />
WriteUninstaller &quot;theUninstaller.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, I want the user to see that foo.exe was extracted and that theUninstaller.exe was created, but I don't want them to see that bar.exe was extracted.  bar.exe is a helper in the installation, not part of the product, so, I don't want to confuse the issue by having it displayed as being extracted and then not being there after installation.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  SetSilent won't work because it stays in effect for the whole of the installation.  CopyFiles doesn't work either.<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
Dave S.</div></div><hr />
