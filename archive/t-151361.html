<br />
Just one thing to discuss:<br />
<br />
I read this article (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=182) on how to remove a MSI based setup. This is okay, but I worked a bit with MSI before I came to NSIS and I use another way to remove. I call MSI related functions. It's not that hard it sounds. IMHO it's the better choice because you will not see the message &quot;do you really want to remove ... bla bla&quot;. You can show your own message or work silently (just with that MSI progress dialog).<br />
<br />
First of all you have to check that the MSI product is installed. This requires the ProductID (the so called &quot;ProductCode&quot;, s. the article):<br />
System::Call &quot;msi::MsiQueryProductStateA(t '{48E5A72D-whatever-xxxx}') i.r0&quot;<br />
StrCmp $0 &quot;5&quot; 0 NotInstalled<br />
&quot;5&quot; stands for INSTALLSTATE_DEFAULT and means the product is installed. Then you can remove it by calling another MSI function<br />
System::Call &quot;msi::MsiConfigureProductA(t '{48E5A72D-whatever-xxxx}', \<br />
  i 0xFFFF, i 2) i.r0&quot;<br />
StrCmp $0 &quot;0&quot; +3<br />
<br />
  MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION \<br />
  &quot;Oh boy, there was a problem removing that MSI thing&quot;<br />
  Abort<br />
&quot;0xFFFF&quot; means INSTALLLEVEL_MAXIMUM (= all components of the MSI product), and the &quot;2&quot; (s. 3rd parameter) stands for INSTALLSTATE_ABSENT (= removes the product). The result &quot;0&quot; is ERROR_SUCCESS (= everything went fine). (As short as possible. :) If you want to know more about, you should refer Microsoft's PSDK or MSDN.)<br />
<br />
That's all. When my human translator fixed my spelling problems :D, I will make another suggestion on how to block these old MSI setups.<br />
<br />
Hm ... I'm not sure. Is something like this for the archive only or is it okay that I write here?<br />
<br />

It's OK that you write it here, but if you put it in the Archive too it would be much easier to find.</div></div><hr />
