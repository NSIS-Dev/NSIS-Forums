<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigBang</div><div class="date">4th December 2004, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">i've done some researches that what the problem was. but i cant understand it so i will just write my observations for you. if i click on the setup files for many times (fast) the setup will come up properly after a couple of the same errors, and then i wont have anyproblem. <br />
2) this is really interesting. when my cpu is under more than 80% usage , all setups which use NSIS which i tried worked  the first time and didnt give any error. <br />
now, i overclocked my computer so its p4  2.8c running at 3.2. i wonder its maybe because my rams are not good enough to accept the information that fast or whatever....... my ram is Corsair VS(value select) 512mb (2x256) DDR400<br />
Motherboard MSI 865PE PFISR<br />
any suggestions? any comments? any thing to say about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">To test if the temporary directory is valid, NSIS tries to create a temporary file in it using GetTempFileName. Because of this problem (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=130247&amp;highlight=GetTempFileName), it is called a hundred times, with different prefixes, to avoid timing issues with other installers.<br />
<br />
But I don't think that's the cause of the problem. Is it possible your temporary directory got filled up? It doesn't quite fit with your overclocking, but it's the best I can think of right now.</div></div><hr />

Can you please run the attached program in a command prompt window and paste its output here?  <br />
<br />
every single setup file which uses NSIS gives that error. do you want me to do it for all the setup files i have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">14th December 2004, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The program I attached doesn't need any installer to run. Simply open a command prompt, run it, copy its output and paste it here.<br />
<br />
A bit more detailed instruction set: Go to Start-&gt;Run type &quot;cmd&quot; and hit enter In the command prompt, type &quot;cd \&quot; and hit enter Drag the executable icon into the command prompt window Type &quot;&gt;temptestoutput.txt&quot; and hit enter Open C:\temptestoutput.txt and paste its contents here</div></div><hr />

<br />
tried it with more installers, smae thing...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigBang</div><div class="date">15th December 2004, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">byt the way , when i retry it , it gives the same text but nsg becomes something else like nsi or nsp and it randomly changes again and again.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th December 2004, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">That's really weird. It didn't even have to try again. Do you have some kind of anti-virus running in the background? Maybe your anti-virus prevents NSIS from creating a temporary file because it thinks it's a trojan. There was a trojan that was written in NSIS a couple of months ago. That caused a lot of anti-virus programs to detect every NSIS installer. If disabling the anti-virus solves this, try updating to the latest virus definitions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigbang</div><div class="date">17th December 2004, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">found the problem. you were right. i use Dr.web antivirus and when i disable it , i wont have any errors etc. thanks for help.<br />
btw im so proud of my anti virus, keeps me protected from anything....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th December 2004, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Great :)<br />
<br />
Are you using the latest virus definitions of Dr. Web? If you are, we should contact them and inform them of the problem. If you aren't, try updating and test the installers again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigBang</div><div class="date">17th December 2004, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">i've updated it today and its working fine.<br />

Hi, I am having the same problem and the output says.<br />
<br />

after validation - C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp<br />
my_GetTempFileName returned - C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\nsw5B88.tmp<br />

PS: Using Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit and disabling antiviruses didn't work</div></div><hr />
