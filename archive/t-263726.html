I build all my code on Solaris(a major unix based software) and i need to generate a windows installer for the client.<br />
<br />
Here is what I did:<br />
Installed Python 2.5<br />
Installed Scons 0.96.94 <br />
Installed Sun Studio 11 C compiler<br />
<br />
No cross compiler installed.<br />
<br />
When I run the following on Solaris 9:<br />
scons SKIPSTUBS=all SKIPPLUGINS=all SKIPUTILS=all SKIPMISC=all<br />
and got:<br />
<br />
scons: *** No tool named 'midl': not a Zip file<br />
File &quot;/export/home/netop/nullsoft/nsis-2.22-src/SConstruct&quot;, line 9, in &lt;module&gt;<br />
<br />
Can anyone help? What is midi? Thanks!</div></div><hr />

By that i mean compile on POSIX but still generate windows installer.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The NSIS compiler can be compiled for POSIX platforms like Linux and *BSD. Generated installer will still run on Windows only, but this way they can be generated without Windows or WINE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th January 2007, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">First, you must downgrade to SCons 0.96.93, as 94 isn't supported yet.<br />
<br />
Next, make sure SCons supports Sun Studio. I'm not at all sure it does. midl is a Microsoft tool for building type libraries. It's not even used by NSIS. The fact that it even tried using it suggests there's something weird with the environment that it doesn't know. Maybe it found `cl` in the path, or another Microsoft tool.<br />
<br />
I'd try using gcc as it's known to be working.<br />
<br />
Another thing to take into consideration is the processor you're using. makensis doesn't currently work on SPARC. But that shouldn't cause these kind of errors, it should just crash after it's actually built.</div></div><hr />
