This might be done already, but I not found &quot;IPicture&quot; word using forum search or in my &quot;Contrib&quot; folder.<br />

I thought it was weird that the NSIS installer wouldn't allow the use of a .jpg image as the splash image.<br />
<br />
I've tried your file on WinXP Pro SP2, and the .jpg showed up just fine, with no errors. I'm going to try a .gif with transparency tomorrow. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 07:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, John.<br />
Please note, that I used gif with white (0x000000) transparency color in Example.nsi <br />
<br />
&quot;KeyColor - color used for transparency, could be any RGB value <br />
        (for ex. R=255 G=100 B=16 -&gt; KeyColor=0xFF6410), <br />
        use KeyColor=-1 if there is no transparent color at your image.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">John P.</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">It works for .gif with and without transparency, and for .jpg. :)<br />

I've tried .png with transparency too though, but that doesn't seem to work. Any simple way I can make .png work using this plugin?</div></div><hr />

IE also supports all image formats, and code samples are available in Inet, but this is another story..<br />
New &quot;play&quot; plug-in entry (see included sample), now sound works and on my Win98 too. 2 images included to make test more easily.<br />
Transparency extraction from GIF adds 2 kB to dll, so it is not included again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
.gif is OK, but a 24bit .png with transparency looks much better than a transparent .gif with it's 256 colour cap. (.gif gets &quot;pixellated&quot;)<br />
<br />
But either way, thanks for the work you put into it as it is. :)</div></div><hr />

But if anybody wants to add png support - IImgCtx is a keyword. It is a part of IE, but Win95 Gold was last MS OS without IE embedded, so I guess this is safe way.<br />

I am not sure how RGB - BGR color goes from gif to bmp, but on my tests with black and white transparent colors it worked fine. PhotoEditor sets transparent color to white only :( Might be good to test with red transp. color. Tested on Win98 and XP. Some considerations about indexed colors in ipicsplash.txt file - see attachment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a lot of people would appreciate .png support, since a 24bit .png with transparency looks so much better than a .gif with transparency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">31st October 2004, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">my first idea was to use jpeg - it can lose a bit of image quality, but at the same time gives (or must give :) ) image file size, which cannot be reached in image formats without quality loses (gif, bmp, png). If lzma compressor used in package creation, it might be good to compare compressed particular package sizes with 24 bit bmp and png - what compression is better. BTW when I write random data to tape with hardware compression enabled, it takes 11% (average) place more, then without compression. It's about (png compression + nsis lzma compression) - package size may increase.<br />
But any case it would be fine to have all formats (and without taxes :)</div></div><hr />

/BANNER key requires /NOUNLOAD in the command line and 'ShowWindow $HWNDPARENT 2' string in the .onGUIInit function (see incuded Example.nsi).<br />
Finally:<br />
newadvsplash::show [/NOUNLOAD] show in out color [/BANNER] [/NOCANCEL] filename<br />

Two new dll entry points for this mode: wait and stop. First - waits for the end of 'show' and returns control to installer, stop - terminates it (see included Example.nsi).<br />

<br />
I have an &quot;old&quot; installer script that I haven't touched for a long time, but today I needed to compile it again, because I had changed something in the README that comes with the installer. I have NOT changed the script at all.<br />
<br />
Now, when I try to compile this old script, I get an &quot;Invalid command: ipicsplash::show&quot; error.<br />
<br />
I get the same error when trying to use the latest newadvsplash.dll posted above instead of the older ipicsplash.dll.<br />
<br />
ipicsplash.dll worked just fine on NSIS 2.05 or so (maybe it was an even earlier release).<br />
<br />
The &quot;good old&quot; vanilla AdvSplash.dll works, but I'd like to have .gif support. I have managed to create transparency using a .bmp  and AdvSplash as well now, but I'd like to use .gif.<br />
<br />
Any fix for this, so I can use the transparent .gif again?<br />
Or will I have to revert back to an earlier NSIS build to compile?</div></div><hr />

3. Replace file name in the following code and test it in your script:<br />

I came back here now to say that it wasn't the latest NSIS build that was at fault, because I have now tried build 2.00 and had the same problem.<br />

Windows animation control works with AVI (MSDN declares this), but not with GIF. For AVI it is possible to use existing control as splash window, but animated GIFs require some code I guess (for example http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/G-M/bitmap/article.php/c4879/ )<br />
This increases plug-in size and creates problems with transparency.</div></div><hr />

Default 'activate' behavior came with old AdvSplash code. I tested your variant and don't see big differences, but if we'll have more then one reqest I can add this as option. Please note 2 another places in the code: sf() function - attempts to set window foreground on splash creation and removing; TOPMOST splash window style - in some situations this also may be a bit annoying.</div></div><hr />

A splash screen must have PNG for alpha transparency. Otherwise you are constricted to working in a box shape or trying to matte blend a 256 bit gif. Horrible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takhir</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 12:07</div></div><div class="posttext">No. Use BMP, in the compressed archive it's size is the same as for png file.

I was trying this, but it is not right:<br />
rundll32.exe &quot;...path\AdvSplash.dll&quot;, show 3000 1500 1500 -1 splash.bmp</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt the interface of NSIS plugins is compatible with Rundll's syntax. The NSIS plugin function expects a pointer to the top of the NSIS stack and it also expects the arguments to be on that stack. You can't emulate that with a Rundll32.exe, I guess...</div></div><hr />
