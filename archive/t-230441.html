<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radiosoft</div><div class="date">8th November 2005, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We have several installation packages which have base (non changeable) files and several small individual files for each installation.<br />
Each client wants to see his logo and license text in the distribution package, but all exe and other files are the same for all. <br />
When using Compression On (especially lzma) - MakeNSis application works too long (about an hour or so) to create all individual installations.<br />
<br />
THE QUESTION<br />
Is it possible to prepare pre-compressed data files which won't be compressed during install creation process but certainly be decompressed on installation process using installer decompress functionality?<br />
<br />
May be someone has any other suggestion how to manage with such multiple installations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pidgeot</div><div class="date">8th November 2005, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">You can compress them prior to creating the installer, and then include an appropriate extractor in the installer, which you'll compile with no compression. Extract both things to a temporary directory and run the extractor to put the files where they need to be.<br />
<br />
If you distribute your software on a CD or similar, you could optionally choose to just have the compressed file on there directly, and only have the extractor in the installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radiosoft</div><div class="date">9th November 2005, 07:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I'm using external decompressor (lzma) to unpack files.<br />
But NSIS already has built-in decompressor and I wanted to use it. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pidgeot</div><div class="date">9th November 2005, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case, you'd have to take a similar approach and make ONE installer, which you then pacakge into a different one.<br />
<br />
The principle is the same, so you should be able to figure it out. :)</div></div><hr />
