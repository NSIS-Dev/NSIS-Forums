<br />
I was wondering if there is a syntax to write something to a database. Wath I exactly mean is: <br />
<br />
I created a package that does all the installation and regestry entry that I need. The only thing missing is that I have to write a owner code to a database. Wath I want to reach is that I get a popop window where the user has to enter his/her owner code and the pakage has to write this code that the user has entered to the database. These codes are different for each user so I realy need to do it with a popop window or something like that. The database is a .dat file and I have a tool to open this databes and to manualy add codes, but I want it to be done by the package. Please if someone knows how to this let me know. <br />
<br />

Do you know what type of database your DAT file is?</div></div><hr />
