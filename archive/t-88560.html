For example, to have five radio buttons, a set of three that can be chosen between, and a set of two that can be chosen between, thereby providing the option to have two options picked?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdbarker</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 00:41</div></div><div class="posttext">since I had to reformat, and since you wouldn't have wanted my version anyway (i took out support for all the controls except radiobuttons and labels, its not available anymore.<br />
<br />
however, i can MAKE it available, with all the standard controls, if you want.  it just might take some time as i've got some other things going right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snowchyld</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">nah, its ok, the multiple radio's i can do without for now, at the moment i'm working on something and due to the *horrid* way the NSIS scriping language is laid out its taken me about a day to hack it in :weird: <br />
<br />
i have a mirror.ini which is generated server side, pulling out all mirrors available, it then displays the mirror list with radios, then i have to loop thru the list in a nasty nasty fashion checking each state, if the state == 1 i store that to a var and continue..<br />
<br />
the issues with it arn't massive, just annoying :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdbarker</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 03:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I can imagine.  NSIS definitely needs a better way to create owner dialogs than InstallOptions, which is big, and not exactly practical.  I managed to get the dll down to around 7k or so by cutting out everything I didn't need, and re-writing parts of it.  But, that was still too big for my tastes, since with that 7k, I still needed to include several parts of NSIS that I didn't need before to even be able to USE the dll.  So, I just had to find an alternate route.<br />

<br />
if i get time / motivation i'll look into hacking a nicer way of doing things [for me :D ]<br />
<br />
im just finishing off the new fadeSplash as we speak.. hopefully it will work on win9X/ME as well now..<br />
<br />
i just have to find someone with a win9X machine to test it on<br />
<br />
then its back to NSI scripting ;)</div></div><hr />

scripting *cough* -- more like fudging bodging and fumbling... NSIS is great but can be trying at times :p</div></div><hr />
