I'm a newbie to NSIS scripting. I have an installer for a toolbar thats built using NSIS. The same toolbar is re-branded for several different clients. My requirement is if i attempt to install the toolbar of a particular brand, the installer should check to see if the (same)toolbar, of any of the other brands is already present on the system. If present, the installer should launch the un-installer of the already-installed toolbar, and after that only should the installation of the current toolbar initiate.<br />
Can anyone please help me out here? All and any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

According to the detection of a previous installed toolbar, you should checkout the registry for records if any, and/or ${locate} file(s) on specific locations.<br />
Furthermore, if the previously installed toolbar is implemented through a 3rd party installation system, you'd need to know the exact command line arguments you should pass to the uninstaller.</div></div><hr />
