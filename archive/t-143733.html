<br />
Installation Complete. You may run the program from the shortcut on your desktop or via the Start Menu. Uninstallation of the program may be accomplished via the Start Menu or Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming others have had to display this in their installers...if so, could you show me the phrasing that you used?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcagle</div><div class="date">27th July 2003, 04:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but I was wondering if anyone has some good, professional sounding words to present the user with. I thought that maybe someone has already had to do this before, so maybe they have a good description for what I want to present to the user.</div></div><hr />

I find that I can only get 5 lines of text doing it the !define MUI_TEXT_FINISH_INFO_TEXT way (I've posted this in this forum in a different thread).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to make the Finish page InstallOptions label control larger to fit more text on it.<br />
I think this can be done through changing the installoptions write in the system.nsh file.<br />
