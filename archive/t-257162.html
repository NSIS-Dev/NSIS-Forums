I want to check that &quot;Has the Operating System (OS) set up my program yet?&quot; If the OS is not installed, I will run my install. If it is already on my computer, I can abort it. How can I know this?<br />
Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huq.duote.com</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">use register of windows.<br />
<br />
you can set a value when your installer install!<br />
<br />
So you can get this value, you can know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sunlight112</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I also think about register of windows but I still some problems. If your software needs these other software to support,for example: my sql. How can I recognize &quot;my sql&quot; is already on my program and abort it. If &quot;my sql&quot; is not in my program, I must set up this software. I do not know where the registry which these software put.<br />
In my program what can I do to see them?</div></div><hr />

you are use a software like total uninstall scan your sql install,so you can find some info in your register of windows.<br />
for example: a software install in your computer,you can find it here.<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KenA</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm partial for checking the registry and on the file system to see if a core file (like the application .exe) is present. It never hurts to double check. ;)<br />

I still have one question the same subject. How can we make our program to run my sql first our program? It means if the OS does not have my sql,I will set up this program. In NullSoft, I do not know where to put my sql program to run before the main software. Because my sql is necessary for the main software. <br />
If I seperate my sql and my software, It is not useful for user my program. I try to find it out, but I still don't understand it. Can you help me?<br />
I also want to study more about NullSoft but I do not have more except help file.</div></div><hr />
