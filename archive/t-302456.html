<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aerDNA</div><div class="date">26th January 2009, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Could I please get some clarification on the new plugin handling introduced in 2.42?<br />
Which one is true (if any):<br />
1. A plugin stays loaded after calling and is unloaded before installer exits.<br />
2. A plugin is unloaded after calling, unless it specifies that it needs to stay loaded.<br />
If 2. is true: since /NOUNLOAD is deprecated, is there no way to force a plugin to stay loaded?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aerDNA</div><div class="date">27th January 2009, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not a plugin developer, I was asking as a scripter. You say that plugins which don't utilize the changes in plugin api are treated the same as they were before, which means that they're unloaded unless script says otherwise. I did some testing and I've seen for myself that it's true - 'old' plugins which require to stay loaded (e.g. NSISArray, Stack) still work fine, unless you remove /nounload from their headers. So /nounload and SetPluginsUnload still work, and I had thought they were completely obsolete since they were removed from nsis documentation. As for updated plugins, System for instance, they don't respond to /nounload and can't be forced to stay loaded. Or maybe I'm wrong, but I couldn't get a locked system.dll after installer exit (:up: ). I guess I should've done this script-fiddling before posting my confusion. But perhaps someone else was wondering about this and that's why I'm so elaborately answering my own questions. :)<br />
I have another question, though: I used to use /nounload with System even when it wasn't necessary - specifically, when I had it called many times in a script, to avoid repetitive loading and unloading. But I haven't seen anyone else do that and now it's not even possible, so, did it make any sense or can nothing be gained by such approach?</div></div><hr />
