If you want nsis to have a option to be skined than post this poll.</div></div><hr />

Then you need a plug-in that will draw buttons and progress bars itself (BS_OWNERDRAW for buttons).  I think that kickik's idea of having a plugin to customise the look of NSIS is better that making the installer bigger if you are not going to use the functionality anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">3rd November 2003, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS uses a standard Windows interface. If the user has changed the Windows interface using a Windows XP skin or a third-party application, NSIS will of course use this skin (like other Windows applications).<br />
<br />
I think skins are useful for frequently used applications, not for an installer. The whole point of skins is that a user can change the interface to his/her personal preference. Customizing the interface of an installer that you will use for a few minutes doesn't really make sense. Besides, users are very familiar with the wizard interface of most installers (like NSIS).<br />
<br />
A fixed skin for your installer would only make it more difficult to use.<br />
<br />
There are some situations in which I can imagine someone would want to have a fixed custom skin. For example, when creating an installer for a game with great graphics, you might want to use the same graphics for your installer.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone wants to create a plug-in for skin support.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">3rd November 2003, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You can indeed change the whole interface (like the Modern UI does), but you can't use non-standard Windows controls without writing a plug-in.</div></div><hr />

feature then he should do it with plugin. There's no need to add<br />
another overhead into NSIS :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOCa Cola</div><div class="date">4th November 2003, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, i agree, a plugin would be the best thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vlado</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 07:06</div></div><div class="posttext">ok. can someone make a plugin for skin?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Creating a plug-in for something like this is not easy. It will require weeks of work.<br />
<br />
If you need this feature, why not write a plug-in yourself or hire someone to do it for you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree with Joost, doing this involves a lot of work to ensure that everything is correctly (handling of messages, etc) that would need a lot of man hours to ensure it works correctly whatever it is asked to do.<br />
<br />
i'm not saying it's not possible, just a lot of work. i may be able to offer some help on things in a few weeks since i'm working on the skinning of controls to match in with the winamp style. if i can i'm happy to give people any code once i've got some if it will help with things<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Due the nature of this plug-in, there is not much where NSIS knowledge could help. But if you do decide to go for it and have any questions regarding how NSIS is built, I would love to help. You might get faster response on the IRC channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't use the skinning ability of NSIS (using a plugin) in order to maintain the general appearance of installers, but for some programs, this might me a neat idea.<br />
<br />
If the plugin ever gets finished (or even begun with, for a start :)), then I might even use it as some introduction to my program.</div></div><hr />
