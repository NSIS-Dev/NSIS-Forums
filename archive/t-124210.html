<br />
I suggested using NSIS at work instead of a commercial installer then built an installer for an application which works great, everybody is happy :D<br />
<br />
Now management wants to know who installs the software. We would like to send an email at the end of the installation process with some information like login name, windows version, software version etc... Don't worry it is internal use only software, this is not about gathering marketing data or something, the sole purpose is to know who installed what for debugging and maintenance reasons.<br />
<br />
Right now I use a vbs script and MAPI but I would like to use something more universal, SMTP for example, so that we can be sure that the email is sent.<br />
<br />
What would be the best way to do that ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, NSIS rocks :up:<br />
<br />

<br />
There isn't a plugin that does that for you as far as I know, but ask KiCHiK (he'll reply to this post soon).</div></div><hr />

You can use it with nsExec.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry it really is internal use only. Only employees will use it, nobody else.</div></div><hr />
