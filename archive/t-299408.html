<br />
I hope you can help me with my problem! My buddy has wrote a program with NSIS, and now I adopt this project. My problem is the following (you can find an aperture of the codev in the attached file):<br />
<br />
After the installation of the files in my program, the user has to had admins by name some information. This is not the problem, but the installer jumps over this 'admin add' page and I don't know why. Maybe i've forgot something or so, please help me!<br />
<br />
Sure you can write me if you need some addidional information, or the hole code.<br />
<br />
Best regards!</div></div><hr />

This script by itself would do nothing, because the functions are never called.<br />
<br />
Assuming there is another script somewhere that uses these, it looks like line 3 has a macro to check a certain section if it is checked, and only show it if so.</div></div><hr />
