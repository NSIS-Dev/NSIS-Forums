<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">12th January 2002, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Question:<br />
<br />
I want to know all available harddisks and capacities at the machine on which the installer runs. Can I find this in the registry? Or using ReadEnvStr?<br />
<br />
Actually, I think this might be a way to identify a computer uniquely... (at least to a certain amount) because that's what I'm actually trying to do...<br />
<br />
So if anyone has another idea on uniquely identifying computers, please feel free to respond to this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thx all, greetz, Hendri.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">13th January 2002, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">For unique identification, I would go for MAC address as most computers have a network card or modem.<br />
Or hard drive serial number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">13th January 2002, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">the mac adress is not so good because u can change the card.<br />
its bette to check the motherboard<br />
and some more devices<br />
like ms does in xp<br />
<br />
such numbers are stored in the registry<br />
<br />
look at hklm - system - currentcontrolset<br />
<br />
i think this is a little bit difficult bec. the keys a very different on different hardware ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">13th January 2002, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">thx,<br />
<br />
I indeed allready took a look at currentcontrolset. But my problem is: the only items I can recognize for what they do are Reg_Binary and we can't read them using NSIS (see http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=71690)<br />
<br />
So please please please send me an exact registry adress with some Reg_Sz that we can read.<br />
<br />
The best would indeed be something like motherboard...<br />
<br />
Thx all in advance, greetz, Hn3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">13th January 2002, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's put it differently:<br />
<br />
I'm not such an experienced Matlab and Delphi programmer and I want to protect my application from being copied to another computer.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me a hint how to do this? My idea was saving computer identification info to a coded file and check this at runtime. But maybe you experienced guys have a better idea.<br />
<br />
BTW, my application has a plugin for Matlab that does not use dll's or exe's. Just coded text-files. So for this plugin, I think the only way is using some registry setting like I described above.<br />
<br />
But please let me know what you think,<br />
thx, greetz, Hendri.</div></div><hr />
