<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lassar</div><div class="date">29th August 2008, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I just downloaded alexa toobar installer.<br />
<br />
Avir anti-virsue says it is a a DR/alexbar.N.142 dropper<br />
<br />
Then checked out alexa site and says it is using nsis for a installer.<br />
<br />
I googled nsis trojan for the last month and found that most of the anti-virsus compainies seem to say nsis is a trojan.<br />
<br />
So what gives.<br />
<br />
Is it or is it not a trojan ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">claesabrandt</div><div class="date">29th August 2008, 07:55</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS is not a trojan. The source code is available, so you can just look it through yourself and get certain that it is not. If antivirus software detects NSIS to be a trojan, then it may be the vendors of the shipped software, that has a trojan and has used NSIS as an installer. That has nothing to do with NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">29th August 2008, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, you are actually PURPOSELY installing the Alexa Toolbar???<br />
<br />
You do know that its considered Spyware, right?<br />
<br />
Instead of installing it, you should be RUNNING from it!<br />
<br />
But I have no doubt, that you will get warnings from your AntiVirus/Spyware Monitors, as basically anything from Alexa will trigger them, as they (Alexa) are generally considered bad news.<br />
<br />
Heck, if anything, The NSIS project should be mad that these guys are USING NSIS to wrap up their Spyware...</div></div><hr />

Doesn't that say it all, it's not saying the installer is a virus at all.<br />
It's telling you that alexa is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lassar</div><div class="date">29th August 2008, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyway, I have not installed the ie alexabar.<br />
<br />
I deleted it.<br />
<br />
It is Spyware.<br />
<br />
The reason I am going to use it is to improve my google ratings.<br />
<br />
What do you think of making a special profile in FireFox just for it.<br />
<br />
In this case I would run the FireFox Alexa Toolbar profile and pop in to my website once a month.<br />
<br />
Quit, then go to my regular profile.<br />
<br />
Do you think I would be safe if I did this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheik</div><div class="date">30th August 2008, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know much about Alexa, except that it is a Virus/Spyware, but you are kind of playing cards with the devil here...<br />
<br />
How do you know that Alexa will play &quot;nicely&quot; like you want it to?<br />
<br />
By its very nature, it is not MEANT to play nice, but instead, hijack your computer for its own purposes...<br />
<br />
If I were you, I would try to find a different program, that isn't a Virus/Spyware, to use for your stuff...</div></div><hr />
