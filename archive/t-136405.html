<br />
I seems to have problems withmy old nsi script when I update NSIS versions.  There does not been to be any compatibility.<br />
<br />
StartMenu variables usage changes and names changed.<br />
BrandingText usage seems to have changed too.<br />
My SpecialBitmap disappeared.<br />
And maybe more problems that I am not aware of.....<br />
<br />
Is there anyway I can upgrade and still use my old script and not experience such problems?<br />
Its kinda pain-staking to do an upgrade this way.....<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
:cry:</div></div><hr />

You do need to have both sets of docs available to refer back and forth, and it sometimes helps to search the changelog as well.<br />
<br />
The events for tracking page changes actually made my life a bit easier once the Page &quot;leave&quot; callback was added.</div></div><hr />
