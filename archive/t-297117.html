My script fails to delete or rename file with no extension. <br />
I tried the following:<br />
<br />
Delete  &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\MT\mt_install&quot;<br />
Rename  &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\MT\mt_install&quot;<br />
ExecWait '&quot;rename&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\MT\mt_install&quot; &quot;mt_install.txt&quot;'<br />
ExecWait '&quot;rename&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\MT\mt_install mt_install.txt&quot;'<br />
ExecWait '&quot;del&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\bin\MT\mt_install&quot;'<br />
RMDir /r $INSTDIR\bin\MT<br />
<br />
I used SetOutPath $TEMP befor these commands<br />
<br />
What could be the problem?</div></div><hr />

Make sure the file is really where you think it is with IfFileExists and make sure it isn't used by another application using Process Explorer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kudos!<br />
It was locked by another uninstall proccess called by my script:-) I added Sleep and now it works.<br />
Thanks a lot!:-)</div></div><hr />
