<br />
This really wasn't too high on the todo list but I've finally made it to the task. After reviewing some example scripts and actual scripts, I am at a pause, regarding how exactly or what exactly is the best approach to getting ready a script for translation.<br />
<br />
I cannot provide translations other than english and that already seems to be done. I would like my script translated so to present it in different languages.<br />
<br />
Is there a really good guide on a best approach to doing this? Basically, I would like the small popup at the beginning which prompts the user to pick a language. There after the magic.<br />
<br />
What is the best approach as I have scripts both example and real which differ very much in their approach.<br />
<br />
I would like to hear what a guru who is already doing this has got to say. I would like and really appreciate some tips and pointers. Thanks a million!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For you own strings, you can use langauge strings (see Users Manual). If you want other people to help translating, you might want to put these strings in include files.<br />
<br />
See http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=132&amp;instances=0,44</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did dibble and dabble with the file you've mentioned and compared it to the HM NIS EDIT setup script. I've seen them differ in a few ways and just wanted some confirmation.<br />
<br />
Also very much thanks for that link to the archive. I will work with it later on today. Am really tired and seriously need a break from work.<br />
<br />
Thanks a million for your time Joost, hopefully all will go well :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a million! I've got 95% of the language work out of the way thanks to you and the help manual. I got one question in which I do not think there is a positive answer but a question I need to ask.<br />
<br />
Creating a language file effects the .nsi and .nsh installation scripts only? I mean as far as INI files go for the custom screens, their language has to be *hardcoded* into the INI's?<br />
<br />
Thanks again Joost</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am so glad to know this did not need to be hardcoded! I successfully completed this task thanks to you and Joost.<br />
<br />
This installer keeps amazing me... Excellent work!</div></div><hr />
