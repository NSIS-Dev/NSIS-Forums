<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oivind</div><div class="date">18th July 2004, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the Cycling Manager 4 Demo yesterday, but When I clicked the installer I got a NSIS error. It said I could bypass it by using a /NCRC command. I created a shortcut and added a /NCRC at the end of the directory and it installed and the game worked fine. But When I click the uninstall I get the same message, and the /NCRC command doesen`t work now. <br />
<br />
So what can I do to uninstall the demo???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">18th July 2004, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">If you get an error message and you had to bypass it with the /NCRC switch, then that would mean you had downloaded a corrupted installer. You should have downloaded it again.<br />
<br />
Now, I guess because the installer was corrupt, the uninstaller is corrupt too. Therefore, try downloading the demo again and reinstall it. This will write a new uninstaller which should uninstall the demo properly.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />
