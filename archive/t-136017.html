<br />
VERY impressive, solid installer. My hat goes to you.<br />
<br />
Is it at all possible to change the color of the header font in MODERN_UI? I would like to be able to make it white. Also, can the header text be moved/aligned in any way, whether through a ResHacker or, perhaps, in a simpler fasion through the installer script?<br />
<br />
And last, is there any forum discussion/link regarding the use of the different MODERN_UIs, for e.g sdbarker_tiny. I'd like to make a patch installer combined with VPatch, and minimal user interaction.<br />
<br />
Hope I didn't overwhelm you with questions.<br />
Thank you in advance!<br />
<br />

<br />
The best and probably only way to move the text over, would be to put in some spaces :p<br />
I may be wrong though! (I've never attempted to ask the question before)<br />
<br />
For the sdbarker_tiny, I like to use mostly custom pages on it. Apart from that, I'm not sure what you need!<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is one thing I did last year which shows off the flexibility of NSIS!<br />

<br />
I suppose knowing the text width, I could play around with the label positions and right align the header text. <br />
<br />
I certainly wish the foreground color was changeable, since the header background is dark gray, black fonts don't look very well. Now, you'll ask why can't I use a different color? Company branding restrictions. :rolleyes: Could this be done through Windows API/custom DLL, since the labels are just standard windows controls, and we can already change the background color? I just don't want to reinvent the bicycle if this is in the works.<br />
<br />
As far as the use of different modern interfaces, I was just looking for more information on their usage. Most examples use modern.exe as a standard.<br />

<br />
Changing the text color would require changing the source code. If you wish to do that I can tell you how.<br />
<br />
To use another interface just use ChangeUI or define MUI_UI if using the MUI.</div></div><hr />

I tried to look through the source code on my own. but with no avail. What is it that I need to do to change ONLY the header text to white? Thank you in advance.<br />

<br />
This thread was last answered 3 years ago lol, i was wondering if the newer NSIS versions have integrated something of the sort in, as i notice the basic.nsi has its text left aligned just because it has no !define MUI_HEADERIMAGE. thanks</div></div><hr />
