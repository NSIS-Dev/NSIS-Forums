<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jungmin park</div><div class="date">15th July 2003, 03:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have crash problem when I'm using korean at Modern UI. <br />
I don't know the reason exactly, but I found that some korean characters in korean.nsh file make problem. Those characters are in MUI_TEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE, MUI_UNTEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE. I changed those characters and It works well now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th July 2003, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">What version are you using? What's the text showing up? What version of Windows are you using? Does it happen with all scripts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jungmin park</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry It was not crash, It was access violation error.<br />
(MUI version is 1.65, and I use a Windows 2000 pro.)<br />
The charater I removed is 'Àû' &lt;= this is korean letter.<br />
(I don't know whether another korean character exist that makes proplem.)<br />
Whenever Installer meet this letter, It create Msgbox &quot;Application Error / The instruction at &quot;0xxxxxxxx&quot; referenced memory at &quot;0xxxxxx&quot;. The memory could not be 'read'&quot;<br />
<br />
I love NSIS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">When did you download the CVS version?<br />
You've missed the scripts question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jungmin park</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You're very diligent :)<br />
<br />
I downloaded CVS version yesterday using NSISUpdate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the exact text the message contains? And does it happen with all scripts or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jungmin park</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't remember original message.<br />
I changed two messages like below :<br />
<br />
MUI_TEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE &quot;¼³Ä¡¿¡ ¼º°ø ÇÏ¿´½À´Ï´Ù.&quot;<br />
MUI_UNTEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE &quot;ÇÁ·Î±×·¥À» Á¦°Å¿¡ ¼º°ø ÇÏ¿´½À´Ï´Ù.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I said, &quot;Àû&quot; character makes trouble. I put that charater to anyother messege for test. Same error occured when Installer meet a section including that message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, but that doesn't help. I need to know what the message says exactly and if it happens in other scripts. I can sort of understand from your message that it does, but I need a direct answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm experiencing same symptom as Park's.<br />
Korean Windows 2000 Pro, downloaded on July 16th, using Modern UI 1.65(1.65 - June 16, 2003 : changelog says so)<br />
<br />
I checked Dr Watson event from event viewer:<br />
 at 00406CFE (&lt;nosymbols&gt;), c0000005 exception occurred.<br />
<br />
One of the messages making access v : <br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGEFILE_STRING MUI_TEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE &quot;¼³Ä¡°¡ ¼º°øÀûÀ¸·Î ÀÌ·ç¾îÁ³½À´Ï´Ù.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hex code of above suspected Korean character &quot;Àû&quot; : c0 fb<br />
<br />
As English is not my mother tongue, I don't quite understand what you need.<br />
If you rephrase your request &quot;what the message says exactly and if it happens in other scripts&quot; , maybe I can understand fully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">If you rephrase your request &quot;what the message says exactly and if it happens in other scripts&quot; , maybe I can understand fully.I think kichik wants to know:<br />
<br />
(1) Is the message the standard MUI one or has it been modified by the script. If the MUI messages have not been modified by the script then MUI_TEXT_FINISH_SUBTITLE should be &quot;Setup was completed successfully.&quot; But it sounds like you are getting the problem before the installation gets that far?<br />
<br />
(2) Does the problem happen with any of the standard MUI sample scripts (in &quot;C:\Program Files\NSIS\Examples\Modern UI&quot;) or does it only happen with scripts someone has written (even if all they've done is modify a sample script).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I'm talking about the crash message. I'm trying to solve the problem, not learning another language ;)<br />
<br />
flyingfish's report helped, and I think I know what the problem is. But I need to make sure. So please run the installer in the ZIP file, choose Korean and tell me the exact text in the crash message. It would also be helpful if you can check it on b3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">kichik, I ran the zipped installer (forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=1020645)  and no crash occured, no matter what I selected, clicked, typed.<br />
Is it good news? Or, ironicaly, bad one?<br />
<br />
* I forgot to say I tried uninstalling too. No crash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jungmin park</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you solve the problem, kichik?<br />
I downloaded and ran the zipped installer. <br />
It worked well without error message. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't changed a thing. I have just included a .map file that matches the exehead used. The differences between that day's version and today's version have nothing to do with languages.<br />
<br />
One thing I can't understand is when exactly it crashes. Right after LandDLL? In a certain page?<br />
<br />
How about the attached version (compiled with b3)?<br />
<br />
And what happens if you download CVS version from today and try compiling yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Attached file(forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=1020772) works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">And when you compile with b3 or latest CVS version?<br />
<br />
And at what point of the installer does it crash when it actually does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm afraid it will take some time to answer your question.<br />
I'm totally new to NSIS development and I started to reading basic docs :) I hope that maybe Park can find out.<br />
By the way, what's LandDll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">That's ok, we have time.<br />
<br />
LangDLL is the plug-in reponsible of showing the language selection dialog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded snapshot from nightly build(nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip) at 16:48 July 18th GMT.<br />
I built it with VS .net and ran makensis. Still crashes.<br />
<br />
It crashes on certain page(near the &quot;finish&quot; page), not right after LangDll screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you get it to create a .map file, attach it and quote the text on the crash message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">19th July 2003, 04:49</div></div><div class="posttext">If you describe step-by-step procedure, I can follow it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">19th July 2003, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Further report : <br />
I built it with Debug code and when the access violation occurred, fired up the debugger.<br />
<br />
The culprit is pointer &quot;in&quot; of<br />
<br />
  while (*in &amp;&amp; out - ps_tmpbuf &lt; NSIS_MAX_STRLEN)<br />
<br />
However, both &quot;out&quot; and &quot;ps_tmpbuf&quot; seems to have corrupted value.<br />
Especially ps_tmpbuf.<br />
<br />
If you have any question, let me know. I'll look into some more meanwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">19th July 2003, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">We think we've fixed it. Try latest CVS version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flyingfish</div><div class="date">19th July 2003, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Good job! No more crash. I'll continue my previous open-source project, and if something happens, I'll post it here.<br />
<br />
Well done, all.</div></div><hr />
