<br />
Sorry to bother you folks but there are some bright cookies amongst you and I need someone who can tell me this:<br />
<br />
In my installer I need to detect the Apache Tomcat version. There is no regular way to do this as the method changes between versions (clever huh) but apparently the ServletContext#getServerInfo() command (thing) works.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where to put this or what to do with it. I know this is slightly off-topic but it is regarding my NSIS installer and I'm at the end of my tether regarding it!<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading guys<br />
<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">21st January 2005, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly uh mate I've tried. The key locations change across versions. And even change within the same version number. And even if this weren't enough, there might be older keys hanging around from previous installs.<br />
<br />
Ta for reply tho :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm not sure how to proceed with it, i.e. how to write a Java app which will hook into it (and even if I do this, will tomcat have to be running already for it to be detected?).</div></div><hr />
