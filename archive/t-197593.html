<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venu</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have one driver installation setup, where I used to pass one .inf file into the Setupapi.dll.  And then setupapi.dll creates its own oem*.inf and oem*.pnf inside Windows\inf directory.  As sometime my installer doesn't succeed, even then these files remains in the system.  I want to delete these files if the installer has failed.  The only way to find the respective oem*.* file created by my installer is by seeing its date and time of creation.  <br />
<br />
So how can I read the date and time of a file and even the system date and time using NSIS.<br />
<br />
Plz anyone help me out in this regard.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />
Venu</div></div><hr />
