<br />
I must say that I am completely confused as to how I could uninstall my previous versions of an application that were made with MSI (InstallShield Express) via a known Upgrade Code.  As the product code has changed for each build, I cannot just reference an msiexec /x{product code} for each one, and I don't believe I even have historical data on each product code.<br />
<br />
The one common part of the MSI's I had created via InstallShield was the Upgrade Code.  InstallShield has an easy setup to remove previous versions based upon the Upgrade Code, but I see no reference anywhere on how this may be done using NSIS.  I have literally spent hours Googling, reading the manuals, etc, and only have come to bother everyone in hopes that there is in fact a way to make this happen.  Thanks for any help. <br />
<br />

<br />
but just checking the registry, you can look up upgrade codes in<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Installer\UpgradeCodes<br />
and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Installer\UpgradeCodes<br />
<br />
in there you will find a number (not sure if thats the product code), but in the same parent key as UpgradeCodes, there is a subkey named Products with a subkey for that number, in there you will find a value named PackageCode (I'm assuming one of these GUIDs is a product id that you can use) If not, you will have to check msdn to find out how to find the product code<br />
<br />
Edit: looking in the registry is probably not the best way to go about this, you could call MSI api with the system plugin, starting with MsiEnumProducts() or something like that<br />
<br />
Edit2: It turns out, those GUID's in the registry are &quot;encoded&quot;, see http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Blocking_older_MSI_setups Just do a search for MSI on the wiki, several pages with lots of info<br />
<br />
Edit3: MsiEnumRelatedProducts is probably what you want, or if you know the component id; MsiGetProductCode</div></div><hr />
