Professor?<br />

<br />
It is also pretty hard to understand you sometimes. If you want to perform some math operation, use IntOp and IntCmp. For 64 bit numbers, use the system plugin...</div></div><hr />

It is not clear what you want...   Define the problem clearly and competently.<br />
Based on data from the registry - count the 30 days from the initial date?<br />
<br />

<br />
if needed, post your question in english and also your native language and is possible someone can translate it (or can google translate it to try to work out what it is you're actually asking for).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot expect everyone will solve your problems immediately after you post it.<br />
<br />
And asking for full example is bloody rude - no one has an idea what are you trying to achieve!<br />
<br />
If you need help because you cannot do that by yourself then rather use professional services and let someone to make that installer for you.</div></div><hr />
