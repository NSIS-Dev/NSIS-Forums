<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 23:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a modern installer where a .ax file has to registred. I'm doing that with the command:<br />
<br />
RegDLL &quot;$SYSDIR\something.ax&quot;<br />
<br />
During installation a little dialog appears when the .ax file is registred. I have a choice of choosing YES or NO. But I want the installer to choose for me, so the user wont be interupted with this choice. Is that possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">22nd March 2003, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">So the DLL displays a messagebox? Is it no error message?<br />
<br />
A possibility would be to use the System plugin to send a keypress. You would have to check which API call to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">22nd March 2003, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not an error message, but a choice that can be made to config the final AX file or registry (Where ever the changes might be stored)<br />
<br />
The thing you mentioned sounds a bit difficult. Do not even know what keypress or API call is, but did not know that is was complicated.<br />
<br />
Just thought that there was a commando like the message boxes have when you have a choice of choosing YES or NO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a file that has to be registered within my modern NSIS installer. I use the command RegDLL, and everything goes fine.<br />
<br />
RegDLL &quot;$SYSDIR\DivXdec4.ax&quot;<br />
<br />
But this .ax file gives a messagebox when registrering, where the user has a choice of YES or NO. (Its not an error box) I want to make a installer where the choice is being made by the installer and not the user, since this will cause confution when different language is included.<br />
<br />
The .ax file can be downloaded here: http://home.no/matricened2/DivXdec4.ax - so you can see what happens. Hope that somebody can help me out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To your question:<br />
<br />
The automatic selection of No solution is far more complicated than I believe you are looking for. I think the best solution for you would be just to consult the creators of this file on a way to registry it silently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">- not a bad idea, but lets just say...the last! I have seen it in another NSIS installer, so I know that it is possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you actually see the message box come up and disappear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it came shortly and then dissapired after 1 sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 21:33</div></div><div class="posttext">What version of NSIS were they using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">It was not the modern one, think it is v1.96.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK, on a version that's not 2.* they'd have to use an external program. I suggest you just ask them for this program. I don't currently have the time to explain to you how to write this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">30th March 2003, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks alot anyway cause it helps me on the way. Also noticed that another file was being extracted so that might be it. Will return with this subject here if I find a solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DVDK</div><div class="date">28th April 2003, 00:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I still trying to solve this problem, but havent found a solution for it yet. So I was wondering if there is a NSIS command that can close the dialog window that appears upon installation (RegDLL).<br />
<br />
The dialog contains a question between YES or NO as written before. I does not matter if I cant choose, just as long as the dialog window closes by itself or does not appear at all.<br />
<br />
Hope that a solution can be found :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">28th April 2003, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a little plug-in that doesn't let any dialogs to be created (a message box is a dialog). The message box still beeps, but I'm a bit short on time so I went on the easy solution instead of removing the beep too.<br />
<br />
Attached with an example. Put the DLL in your plugins directory, do whatever you want with the source.<br />
<br />
Make sure you:<br />
 Do not remove the /NOUNLOAD switch<br />
 Always call stop<br />
 Do not start the plug-in before you really need it and stop it as fast as you can</div></div><hr />
