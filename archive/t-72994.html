<br />
Anyway, if I use the EnumRegKey instruction in an installer, and run the installer on Windows NT (and I suppose Windows 2000/XP as well), the instruction will fail.<br />
<br />
Looking into the source code in exehead/exec.c, I saw that the registry was opened with all access. By changing the access from KEY_ALL_ACCESS to KEY_READ, everything worked OK.<br />
<br />
Here is a diff of the change:<br />
<br />
1094c1094<br />
&lt;       	if (RegOpenKeyEx((HKEY)parms[1],buf2,0,KEY_ALL_ACCESS,&amp;key) == ERROR_SUCCESS) <br />
---<br />
&gt;       	if (RegOpenKeyEx((HKEY)parms[1],buf2,0,KEY_READ,&amp;key) == ERROR_SUCCESS) <br />
<br />
It would be great if this correction could make into the official NSIS distribution, as NSIS apart from this little problem is exactly what I needed. I would prefer to not keep my own branch of NSIS.<br />

We all have administrator level access,  though.  I can try seeing what happens if you try without that,  but as I said it's EnumRegVal and not Key.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
