<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">23rd October 2006, 03:50</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, i am looking into the suitability of different installers, any help is much appreciated.<br />
These are the features i'd like to be able to use, if they're available:<br />
<br />
Install to Windows CE Devices<br />
<br />
Different components that can check online for new versions (and download if necessary).<br />
<br />
Ideally want to be able to install java and smart phone applications<br />
<br />
Can we access new data from website to update? <br />
<br />
Can we gather registration info from online to write to the mobile device registry? <br />
<br />
Can we have a web plug in so that the user can register an account on our website?<br />
<br />
Can we install upgrades? <br />
<br />
Can we tell the installer if there are new versions of the application?<br />
<br />
I would just like to get an idea if NSIS is capable of most of these actions and if so, where would be a good place to start learning, i would like to add i'm very unexperienced in coding/scripting, would like to start at the very beginning and prepare for a steep learning curve.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, Zbd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th October 2006, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">The wiki contains some examples (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Copying_files_to_pda) for copying files to PDA devices.<br />
<br />
You can download files and thereby check for newer versions using NSISdl or InetLoad (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InetLoad_plug-in).<br />
<br />
You can check versions using whatever method most suitable for you, be it saving versions in INI files or comparing DLL versions.<br />
<br />
A good place to start learning is the examples and the documentation.</div></div><hr />
