<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam_Engenuity</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to disassemble the compiled exe, and extract files from it? If it is, i would need to know which program can do it and if there is a way around it. I also need to know if the exe is encripted.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Also NSIS installers are not encripted. Someone asked the exact same questions last week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam_Engenuity</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried several disassembler, however with no success. I've spent three days none stop. I don't think that there is a program that dissambles NSIS's compressed executable.<br />
<br />
However i was able to extract cab files from the installsheild proving that the installshield is not as secure as i thought.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your replies</div></div><hr />
