I'm a newbie. I made an installer, and now I'd like to improve the way it reinstalls (uninstalls previous installation and installs). I have three solutions:<br />
<br />
- a pop-up question &quot;Would you like to reinstall&quot; in onInit that if yes deletes the files etc but does not show progress (seems to user that program disappeared/stopped working)<br />
<br />
- like the above but it pops up the old uninstaller with execwait. I don't like this because a dumb user could be confused with the two windows and mess up the reinstallation process.<br />
<br />
- I tried to solve these problems by having a solution where the uninstall stuff was done in the  install section if a previous install was detected, but it was still asking for the new installation's directory before uninstalling which was kind of messy.<br />
<br />
What I actually want to do is pop up the question if a previous installation is detected, then an uninstallation page (with progress etc), then ask for instdir, then install. Is there an &quot;easy&quot; way to do this?<br />
<br />
Sorry if this question was answered before, I did search.<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

If an old version is found to be installed, all you need to is select the section (use !insertmacro SelectSection ${SecUninstall} from Sections.nsh) and give it a name (SectionSetText) so that the section is displayed on the components page.<br />
