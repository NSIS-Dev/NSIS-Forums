<br />
I have a problem, I need to install large amount of files, that are divided in more directories, and the mass of files is too big to write and define them all with &quot;file&quot;<br />
<br />
I need to define 4 folders, that should be just copied to a installpath.<br />
<br />
with &quot;file test.txt&quot; I got something like &quot;take this file, include it into my install.exe and then extract it to a directory chosen by user using that install.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
and I need &quot;take this and this directory include it into my my install.exe and then extract it to a directory chosen by user using that install.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope you will get, what I mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dave</div><div class="date">15th January 2008, 02:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, you probably want   File /r &lt;directory&gt;<br />
That will similarly include the directory and all it's subdirectories. File also allows for [partial] pattern matching, just for your information. Otherwise, refer to the user manual for the File directive, though I think what you want is File /r<br />
Enjoy,<br />
Dave :)<br />
<br />
By the way, the /r is for Recursive (recursively include files/directories).</div></div><hr />
