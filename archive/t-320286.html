We will pay well, and we have worked with one guy previously from these forums for some simple work, but just seeing if anyone is more experienced with customizing User Interfaces and wants some cash and wants to work on a project with us.<br />
<br />
A knowledge of web-based languages would also be beneficial so we can do some web-integration into the installer. (More details upon Request)<br />
<br />
If you're interested, you can leave a reply, or shoot us a PM and just list any work you have completed. <br />
<br />
We will pay well.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
<br />
R3n.</div></div><hr />
