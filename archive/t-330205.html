<br />
Question: is it possible to show the names of the files that are being deleted in a Nxs popup window?<br />
<br />
Basically what happens, in my script when the user clicks on a button the main window gets minimized, a Nxs popup appears and some operations take place. Usually I updated the progress through Nxs status messagges but when I'm deleting a lot of files the user won't see any changes going on and is not satisified just to see the marquee progress bar.<br />
Is there a way to have the RMdir/del results be shown in the Nxs popup? I know the Detailed View of the instfiles does it, is there a way to capture that output and push it to Nxs?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any replies!</div></div><hr />

One workaround I can think of is using findfirst/findnext and deleting all matches one at a time. Then you'll have the filename you're deleting.<br />
<br />
Important note: it is a VERY bad idea to do something like &quot;RmDir /r $instdir&quot;, especially in the uninstaller. The reason: You should only delete what you KNOW you want to delete. Deleting blindly is very bad practice. In the uninstaller it gets worse, because $instdir equals $exedir in uninstallers. If the user moves uninstall.exe, you'll end up deleting the entire program files, or windows, or even root directory.</div></div><hr />
