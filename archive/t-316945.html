<br />
I can run the installer while it's already running. I wanna check whether the installer is running before starting the installation, if that so I can prompt a message to user and abort the current installation process.<br />
But when I check the process list, it shows same process name for each and every installer process. Is there any plugin or method to count the number of processes for a specific program or any other way to find a solution to this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">watzr</div><div class="date">12th February 2010, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh.. Thank U so much... This made my task easy instead of the long script I've written. It handled multiple instances of the installer well.<br />
<br />
But I faced to a problem with uninstaller as it came with the script I've written too. Problem is when I checked the list of running processes, it doesn't show the uninstaller's name as I given in the script (say &quot;uninstall.exe&quot;). I can find the uninstallation process name from that list and use it. But I don't know whether that method is good. I appreciate if someone can you give me a clue to find a solution or to find an explanation of changing uninstallation process name in the process list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">13th February 2010, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">you should probably use the same method (creating a mutex and checking for that) for the uninstaller - the filename of the uninstaller changes randomly as the uninstaller (say A.exe) creates a temporary copy of itself (B.exe), and launches that so that it can delete the original uninstaller (A.exe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">watzr</div><div class="date">14th February 2010, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Animaether, do you mean that I should use the temporary name of the uninstaller to uninstall the appalication? i have checked the uninstaller in in two different computers and it gave the same temporary name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">watzr</div><div class="date">16th February 2010, 03:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have written the script as a message box prompts when user runs the uninstaller. This came just after the code written to check whether multiple instances are running. When I removed that part, the name I've given for the uninstaller has been taken instead of taking the randomly given name. But I don't have an exact idea about how this problem was solved by removing the message box prompting.<br />
Thanks for the replies. They really helped me on this work.</div></div><hr />
