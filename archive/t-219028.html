<br />
I have the following directories in the source path:<br />
<br />
bin<br />
mysql\bin<br />
Copy of mysql\bin<br />
<br />
When I use <br />
<br />
File /r &quot;bin&quot;<br />
<br />
it will install all of the three directories.<br />
<br />
I tried <br />
<br />
File /r &quot;.\bin&quot;<br />
<br />
but without success... Any idea (using 2.06)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
JOERN</div></div><hr />

File /r bin\* <br />
<br />
Yes, that would do...<br />
But it's very complicated...<br />
I used <br />
<br />
CreateDirectory &quot;$INSTDIR\bin&quot;<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\bin&quot;<br />
File &quot;bin\w32&quot;<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
but there should be a better solution I think. Just think of an huge install directory, where many (sub-)directories of that kind exist. For that developer has to use the four lines for each directory if he's not definetly sure, there isn't another directory of that name somewhere below.<br />
<br />
I would be nice if there's a way like <br />
<br />
File /r &quot;.\bin&quot; <br />
or<br />
File /r &quot;^bin&quot; (Perl-Pattern)<br />
<br />
I think it's a necessary enhancement...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answers though.<br />

<br />
Sure, but for me this is not the way it should be (or there has to be a notice in the documentation about it)  :(.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway.</div></div><hr />
