<br />
I (rather a NSIS newbie) want to do some things in an existing MySQL database installation using NSIS.  In detail, I ask the user for the root password of the database installation, the connection and the name of some database the system should create on that installation afterwards.<br />
<br />
Now I want to check some things on leaving a function.  First, are connection string and password correct?  Second, does the database which should be created afterwards already exist (which would be bad)?<br />
<br />
My idea so far is doing this using some simple shell scrips.  E.g. I want to run a shell script in the leave function, trying to connect using the data the user entered.  If it succeeds, ok, if not I want to present an error.<br />
<br />
My question is: Is using shell scripts for this a good idea, or is there a better one maybe?  And, if I use shell scripts, how do I manage and call them?  The documentation of Exec tells me that &quot;Note that the file specified must exist on the target system, not the compiling system.&quot;.  This would mean that I would have to transfer my shell script first to the installation system somehow.  I think it would be better, if I would be able to tell NSIS &quot;there is the script, pack it into the executable and call it in this situation&quot;.  Is something like this possible?  How would you solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any hints!</div></div><hr />
