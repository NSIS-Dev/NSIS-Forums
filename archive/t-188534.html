<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breepee</div><div class="date">1st August 2004, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I've created a standard NSI template for use in my installers. It works perfectly and I have used in in dozens of other installers and they all work fine.<br />
<br />
The other day I made a new installer. When running from harddisk it works fine. When I burned it to CD-R, it suddenly checks CRC at the start (which is disabled in the script and when running from harddisk it doesn't run the check) and at 95% or so it says it's corrupt.<br />
<br />
The package was compiled with NSIS 2.0 flat and the package size was 783MB. I burned it to a 800MB CD using Nero with overburn activated and disk-at-once. All went fine. Nero says 'Disc succesfully burded' or something linke that.<br />
<br />
What's going on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">1st August 2004, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably didn't disable CRC checking correctly. It also checks when running from hard disk but you won't see it because a hard drive is much faster than a CD drive.<br />
<br />
I think something went wrong with overburning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breepee</div><div class="date">2nd August 2004, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I disabled it properly, because the file is almost 800MB (I sure would notice that, even from HDD) and with other files I've burned normally on 700MB CD-R with sizes op to 650MB I've never had the check (because it disabled with &quot;CRCCheck off&quot;).<br />
<br />
And it's essentially the same script. The only diffence is the name of the software.<br />
<br />
I agree that overburning may have something to do with it, but it wouldn't explain why CRCcheck suddenly shows up.</div></div><hr />
