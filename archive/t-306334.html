<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTDP</div><div class="date">13th May 2009, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I need users to install 2 software packages. Both are .exe files. To make it easy, I am looking for an &quot;Installer&quot; package that I can use that will:<br />
* include both software packages<br />
* install both packages<br />
* prompt the user for their name, company &amp; e-mail address and forward this info to an e-mail address. I want to know who has installed the software.<br />
* allow me to update the installer package for new releases of the software I need installed.<br />
<br />
Can NSIS do all this?<br />
I don't know how to write the scripts for a trouble free installation! Can anyone help?<br />
I am happy to pay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lewellyn</div><div class="date">13th May 2009, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm assuming that the 2 packages are .exe files with silent install options. If so, the first two points are simple.<br />
<br />
The third point, you'd have to write a custom dialog page and post the data to a script on a web server (the script could store the data in a database, email you the info, whatever; it's not relevant to the installer :)). Not terribly difficult, but there is a slight learning curve there.<br />
<br />
The final point is kind of vague... Are you saying that the software ought to be able to check for updates online and then install them? If so, NSIS won't help with the application side (of course), but it has a VPatch plugin that should help with the installer side. :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />
If I use a custom dialogue page, can this run when the installer runs? I am not interested in who downloads the software. I want to know who installs it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">13th May 2009, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">You could put the usersnooping code right the .onInit callback; that's what gets run first thing in an NSIS installer (after unpacking, if applicable).<br />
<br />
Note: users don't like snooping :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lewellyn</div><div class="date">13th May 2009, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, .onInit won't be the right place to put up a dialog page. Usually, you'd insert it right after your license agreement. If it's mandatory, you can even disable the Next button before allowing installation to continue. However, note that you have no way to guarantee people won't fill it out with bogus data. :)<br />
<br />
Animaether, requesting information before allowing an installation isn't exactly snooping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">13th May 2009, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">well not if you're requesting it, no :)</div></div><hr />
