This should be built into the program rather than having to recompile the code to get it to work. I'm talking about any icon. Not just the nsis onen. The icon in the window, the icons in the selection of options etc... Right now as the program sits you have to have all 16 bit icons. I'm not a programmer and don't have the tools to recompile the source code unless there is a free one out there.</div></div><hr />

NSIS has such a small overhead that even a 256 colour icon could make a significant differance.  If you'd like, email me the icon you want to use and I'll compile it for you.  I haven't tried 20x20 ones yet - but I will be giving it a shot soon.  Send me them too and I'll see whether I can get them in there too.  <br />

I'm talking about any icon. Not just the nsis onen. The icon in the window, the icons in the selection of options etc.By changing the one main icon to high colour, the one in the window will change as well. You just need to find 766 in the source and replace it with however big a high or true colour icon is.<br />
<br />
The section selection :igor: box uses bitmaps, so that should be a case of going through the source, finding 358 and replacing it with 1254.</div></div><hr />

A lot of folks here seem to have been successful compiling it with borland's free compiler.  If you do a search you'll find a lot of folk have posted help on using it in the past.<br />
