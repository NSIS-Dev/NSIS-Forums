<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rothgar</div><div class="date">13th July 2001, 04:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having some serious problems with Sections... I want to make one exe that is an Install and a restore in one... is it possible. I got all the coding down then went to making the sections. It labelled the InstType's 1 and 2 and all seemed fine. I then went to my Sections and made 1 SectionIn 1 and the other SectionIn 2. 1 turned to 0 and 2 turned to 1 so that was fine I just increased the values by one and got them correct. but then the first Section is always defaultly selected. How can I make both of them unselectable so you can choose one or the other? or can you even do this?<br />
Help appreciated thnx<br />

Try the following as your first section:<br />
<br />
; Required Section <br />
Section &quot;&quot;<br />
SectionEnd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th July 2001, 05:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Another Idea is that the first item be the reason why the person downloaded the whole thing. Like Winamp, The Winamp agent is first. There is no way to disable it, it just that way. If you have a collection of programs in an individual installer, make the first section HTML files or my Trademarked nothing.exe. The code is:<br />
Name &quot;Nothing.exe&quot;<br />
OutFile nothing.exe<br />
Icon youricon.ico<br />
SilentInstall silent<br />
<br />
Section &quot;&quot;<br />
;See I told you it did nothing<br />
SectionEnd<br />
It's perfect for displaying Icons in an EXE file. Then place that in the first section then just create a Message Box saying &quot;Cleaning Up...&quot; then delete it.</div></div><hr />

Now For my Restore Section can I bypass the Uninstall String? because I don't need the uninstall part for the restore just for the install to get rid of the registry stuff.<br />
Thnx<br />
