<br />
Finally got some times to look for more stuff on NSIS... I use NSIS to make installation package for my apps... but I've two questions:<br />
<br />
1. Is it somewhere a project/extension/future plan/whatever that will take care of localization (basically translation) of NSIS UI? If no, is someone interrested in? (I made localization for french, but cuz NSIS source code contains lot of hardcoded string, I've to do it again if I wanna follow new NSIS releases, I think a more &quot;windows resources&quot; approach would make it more stable, easier to translate, ...).<br />
2. Any plan to support more than poor 16 colors icons for installer package (again, I made it for a particular version of NSIS... but again I was surprised that so many things were hard coded... why not a beatiful #define for icon offset?).<br />
<br />
That's all, if someone have the time to tell me:<br />
1. If someone already take care of it?<br />
2. If it's possible to post change to NSIS that will be used in future release?<br />
3. What's the answer to the question of live, universe and everything? (one thing's sure, it's not 47).</div></div><hr />

The idea was born at this (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=68522) thread and the version history on firehose.net (http://www.firehose.net/free/nsis/index.html) speaks of Soon (for 2.0 hopefully) we will have full multilanguage (multiple languages per installer) support<br />
<br />
BTW - the question of live, universe and everything is 42 :D <br />
