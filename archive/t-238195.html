<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmaerten</div><div class="date">16th February 2006, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I have several registry keys within one registry key, and I would like these keys to be put into a listbox that is used in the installation.  For example I would have:<br />
HKLM SOFTWARE\MySoftware\cat<br />
HKLM SOFTWARE\MySoftware\dog<br />
HKLM SOFTWARE\MySoftware\rooster<br />
HKLM SOFTWARE\MySoftware\elephant<br />
<br />
So, in my listbox I would want the items: cat, dog, rooster, and elephant.  This is because these keys have unique directory values that choose where the install directory should be.<br />
<br />
Please note: I would like this without using the registry plugin if possible.  I don't know if ReadRegStr can read keys instead of just values.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.9.2 (4.9.2.5). Seems like you can use this to enumerate your subkeys and then parse off everything before the final &quot;\&quot; to get the subkey name itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, I still need help figuring out which item was selected.  I am looking at the ListBox example, but I can't figure it out yet.  In my ini file, the &quot;Field 2&quot; is the listbox.  I want to disable the next button until an item is selected.  Once it is selected, I want to be able to use it (ie. stored in a global variable)  If anyone can tell me the code to do this I'd greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

I'm also releasing an EmbeddedListBox plugin which is like an IO page except you can have a multicolumn list view with headings (report view) and optionally with checkboxes as well.<br />

<br />
To find out what they've selected, just use:<br />
<br />
Push $0<br />
!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_READ $0 &quot;ininame.ini&quot; &quot;Field 1&quot; &quot;State&quot;<br />
<br />
Where your ini is called ininame.ini, and your list is in Field 1.</div></div><hr />

Everything is working great now.</div></div><hr />
