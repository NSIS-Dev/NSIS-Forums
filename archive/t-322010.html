<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">burroughs123</div><div class="date">27th August 2010, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">During an upgrade, I uninstall the previous version of the software silently (using: ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\uninstaller.exe&quot; /S _?=$INSTDIR') then install the latest software. There is around a 30-40 second time period between the time when the uninstall is removing files and when the Welcome dialog appears for the new installer. During this time, there is no GUI interface showing the end user that anything is happening. Is there any way to display a dialog from the new installer detailing that the uninstall is taking place? Some end users may just rerun the new installer. Please note that before the upgrade (uninstall old software then install new software) occurs a Message Box prompts the user to confirm upgrading the software.<br />

thanks for your time,<br />

Personally, I think the uninstall shouldn't happen until they press &quot;Install&quot; on some later screen. I think they should be able to see all the screens and cancel if they don't want to run the new installer.<br />

<br />
Edit: and demiller9 has a good point. You should never touch the system until after they click Install.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">27th August 2010, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I've solved this is by making the silent uninstall be optionally not-so-silent.<br />
<br />
I.e.<br />
A. if a user really, really wanted to.. they could execute the uninstaller silently and they truly wouldn't see a thing.<br />
B. if the user simply launches the uninstaller (via control panel, start menu, or launching directly), they get the full-blown GUI.<br />
C. if my installer launches the uninstaller as part of its proceedings, it adds a little flag on the command line.  That tells the uninstaller that it should skip all the pages and such asking if the user really wants to uninstall and that they're welcome to re-install at a later time, defaults the uninstaller to keeping the registry settings on installation location (no-brainer there)... -but- still presents the UninstFiles page so that the user can see what's going on and can see progress of uninstallation.</div></div><hr />
