<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DragonSoull</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">how do I do this?<br />
Is it possible? I looked the config.h and found nothing (but i'm no coder) also after removing will makensis work normaly?<br />
<br />
And by the way can anybody give me some insight on how nsis works on the exehead side? maybe i can save some bits by optimizing my script :)<br />
<br />
that's all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no config.h line, you have to do it manually. It would be great if you can submit a patch for it here (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=373087&amp;group_id=22049&amp;func=browse).<br />
<br />
As for any insights on the exehead side, anything specific you would like to know? It starts in Main.c, calling ui_doinstall() in Ui.c, moving on to exec.c whenever some NSIS is code should be executed. Depending on what you don't need you shuold focus on either one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DragonSoull</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">:eek: I couldn't a barely have time to finish a translation :(<br />
Any way commenting out some difines is prety easy for me too do but what you ask, I don't know if can do it, i get scared just thinking about it, any i'll look into it but i don't think ill be able to do anything  :( <br />
<br />
The shame<br />
<br />
[EDITT]<br />
In config.h line 258 there are two defines<br />
NSIS_COMPRESS_USE_ZLIB<br />
NSIS_COMPRESS_USE_BZIP2<br />
<br />
is this the part i would have to change?<br />
or theres more to it then that?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DragonSoull</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">after looking at the sources for about an hour this morning i know it is :( <br />
(I'm realy sorry i can't help)<br />
<br />
Also I totaly forgoth what i meant by the iner working is how does nsis processes the script, does it stores it inside the installer or converts it to something else? etc.. basiclly i whanted to know if i could optimize an nsis script so it would work better and be smaller.<br />
<br />
Any way, i'll probably keep banging my head into the code for a bit longer, got some free time and who knows I could learn something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS converts every instruction in the script to one or more entries. An entry is:<br />
<br />
typedef struct<br />
{<br />
  int which;<br />
  // count and meaning of offsets depend on 'which'<br />
  int offsets[MAX_ENTRY_OFFSETS];<br />
} entry;<br />
<br />
Currently MAX_ENTRY_OFFSETS is defined as 6.<br />
<br />
Commands are converted to entries in Script.cpp. Every entry is processed by ExecuteEntry (in exec.c). To optimize your script just use less instructions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DragonSoull</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Then i guess there isn't any thing i can do :) at least in my current script</div></div><hr />
