<br />
I also just clicked on the link to download the nightly build ZIP file and it also comes up with the trojan.<br />
<br />
Is this correct or does the download code in nsisdl look like the trojan?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
download.trojan is a generic TYPE not a specific.Alot of code may fit the &quot;profile&quot; of download.trojan for example...nsisdl.dll may be loosly associated merely because attemps connections.This is called a &quot;false positive&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So - sounds like the consensus is that this is a false-positive.</div></div><hr />

well i have been using nsisdl.dll for some time..while it has some issues,being a trojan isnt one of them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">screff</div><div class="date">10th August 2004, 01:31</div></div><div class="posttext">The same thing happens to me.  If I try to compile any NSI scripts Symantec AV quarantines the dll saying that it is Download.Trojan.<br />
<br />
I'm using Symantec Anti-Virus Corporate Edition 9.0.0.338 Scan engine 1.2.0.13 with defs at 8/9/2004 rev. 37.<br />
<br />
I think the definitions that came out today started detecting it.<br />
<br />
I posted to Symantec's support forum in the hopes that they will fix this in their next virus definition upgrades.  The post is available here: http://*******.com/6csvr</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ferec</div><div class="date">10th August 2004, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that was the only one quarantined.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ekiller200</div><div class="date">10th August 2004, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why Norton is flagging this dll now? I could be wrong but I do belive norton comes out with new virus defs on tuesdays. A dll that can fetch a file from the internet along with a dll to execute a the downloaded file could beconsidered dangerous.. But it is also a great tool.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless.. I fixed this Norton problem by rebuilding nsisdl.dll from source.  I don't know the detail on why this works, but I am going to look into this more.(to make sure it doesn't happen again) <br />
<br />
unfortunately I think all clients who are using our old install will have this problem if they are running norton antivirus..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have quite a few installers, that worked fine yesterday, now the same binary a day later is popping up the Norton Virus Quarantine as posted above. Has anyone found a resolution to this?</div></div><hr />

N/m I got it. Why can't they just get live update to do it as well! Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It states right on the McAfee Customer Support Knowledge Base page that the virus definition files 4388, are incorrectly identifying nsisdl.dll as being a virus. They also state that this has been addressed in the 4389 definitions. However, they haven't released the 4389 definitions as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brummelchen</div><div class="date">27th August 2004, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">@mcafee users - define &quot;nsisdl.dll&quot; as exception rule (file/folder) for read&amp;write. (access and manually scan)<br />
no target folder needed, just the name cause this dll is mostly used in a nsis-tmp-folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MarkEWaite</div><div class="date">20th May 2006, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Symantec's virus definition file dated 18 May 2006 version 17 again shows NSISdl.dll from NSIS 2.16 as infected with Trojan.Download.  http://nsis.sourceforge.net has a new version, 2.17, that Symantec does not report as virus infected, but we've manufactured 1500 CD's that include NSISdl.dll and don't want to destroy those CD's because Symantec has a false positive in their definition file.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on the best way to persuade Symantec that their flagging is a false positive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th May 2006, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Use their own tools to report it or the submission form (https://submit.symantec.com/false_positive/index.html). There is no need to destroy any CDs, they'll fix it.<br />
