<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dakkor</div><div class="date">15th August 2003, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Two completely different topics, but oh well :)<br />
<br />
1) Is there any (easyish) way to have a NSIS install wait for another NSIS uninstall to finish. If the user wants to install and an old version is detected, it'd be neat (I think) to be able to uninstall the old one then continue with the new one. But execwait doesn't work as the installer spawns off another temporary process that does all the work.<br />
<br />
2) Anyone tried porting nsismake (console mode obviously) to Linux? Thinking about having the ability to package up a set of plugins with the default install, and have the user just download it prepackaged from my site. Only trouble (not in the general sense) is that my webhost is running Linux ... From a quick glance through the source code it doesn't look tooooooo win32 specific (though I may be looking in the wrong spots).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th August 2003, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">1) The FAQ contains the answer:<br />
<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/site/index.php?id=19&amp;backPID=15&amp;tx_faq_faq=14<br />
<br />
2) NSIS 1.98 shouldn't be too hard to port, and I have already seen someone do it (Miranda IM used to do this). NSIS 2 is a different story. It uses some Win32 specific functions that I am unsure how to port to Linux (mainly Unicode).<br />
<br />
The easy solution is simply using Wine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dakkor</div><div class="date">15th August 2003, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops on number 1, not sure how I missed that :hang:<br />
<br />
Regarding #2, unfortunately wine is not going to be installed (I had a &quot;discussion&quot; with the admin about this), so the only option is a port of NSIS 2 (since I use NSIS 2 specific stuff). Since it doesn't look to bad (judging from the imports it uses), I'll give it a bit of a go over the next week or so and see how close I can get to making it compile.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the fast reply!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th August 2003, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck. If you get it to work submit a patch at SourceForge and we might include it in the next release.</div></div><hr />

I'm very interested in anything you come up with :)</div></div><hr />
