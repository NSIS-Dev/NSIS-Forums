<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jonbhanson</div><div class="date">15th December 2009, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">In my install script, I have the following line that registers a custom DLL:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro InstallLib REGDLL NOTSHARED NOREBOOT_PROTECTED &quot;TVRes2.dll&quot; &quot;TVRes2.dll&quot; &quot;$SYSDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
The DLL lands in the correct spot, but it doesn't seem to be registered.  If I try to run my app, I get an error.  If I register the DLL manually<br />
<br />
regsvr32 TVRes2.dll<br />
<br />
The application works correctly.  Can anyone give me some insight of what I might be overlooking?  I also tried using REGDLLTLB, but no luck.  Thanks.<br />

  Thanks for the fast response!  That was a good call, but unfortunately it wasn't the source of the problem.  As you suggested, I put a message box after the line.  It didn't look like there were any missing dependencies (First time using Dependency Walker).  I tried registering the DLL manually while the message box was up, and after I hit ok and the install finished, the app worked fine.<br />
<br />
Just to be save, I moved that line to the end of the script and tried it again... still no luck.  Any other suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jonbhanson</div><div class="date">15th December 2009, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Found it.  I needed to reference the output location explicitly, even though I had SetOutPath above.<br />
<br />
insertmacro InstallLib REGDLL NOTSHARED NOREBOOT_PROTECTED &quot;TVRes2.dll&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\TVRes2.dll&quot; &quot;$SYSDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the help.  Dependency Walker is killer.  How'd I get along without that before?<br />
