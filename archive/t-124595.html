<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">10th February 2003, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The second beta version of NSIS 2, the new version of the popular win32 installer/uninstaller system is ready. <br />
<br />
NSIS 2 supports highly customized user interfaces, multiple languages, easy usage of plugins and more. And it's still the smallest win32 installer available, with an overhead of only 34 KB. <br />
<br />
The most important changes in Beta 1 are user interface improvements in both the Classic and the Modern UI, language strings that can be used everywhere, support for include directories, validation of file and folder names and a new version of InstallOptions, which makes creating custom pages even easier. <br />
<br />
Also a lot of bugs have been fixed. Not only the new features introduced in Beta 0 are more stable now, but also older NSIS 1.x bugs are gone! <br />
<br />
