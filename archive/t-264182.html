<br />
Now that I found the advanced builds download area, got a new binary installed, ad found the instructions for logging, LogSet(on) gives &quot;Invalid command: LogSet(on)&quot;.  I also have no idea where to put &quot;scons NSIS_CONFIG_LOG=yes&quot;, or if I even need to since I have the new binary.<br />
<br />
Nevermind -- I found &quot;LogSet on&quot; works a bit better.  :-)<br />
<br />
I really hope someone is working to enhance this, because this is a fundamental requirement for a tool such as this.<br />
<br />
Here is the reference page I used to get as far as I got, which apparently isn't very far.<br />

<br />
The logging instructions could be written a little more clearly, IMHO (no offense).  I know -- what do I want for free?  Is it easy to contribute to this project?<br />
<br />
BTW, why is it there exists a binary that doesn't support logging?  Why wouldn't the &quot;advanced build&quot; binary be the standard distribution, and the other be a &quot;minimum&quot; build or something like that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Logging is not enabled by default because it enlarges the result installers.</div></div><hr />
