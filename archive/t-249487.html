What whould be the exact use of controlling this behaviour ?</div></div><hr />

well, it's not dual core because the task manager shows it's only using one. And using dual cores would speed up compressing.<br />

ok, it's not simple, but it may help that 7-zip already does multi-threaded lzma compression.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it shouldn't be too hard to add support to NSIS to compress using two threads (if hyperthreading or dual processors is available).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">28th June 2006, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">If testing your script is the speed problem of makensis use something along the lines off: <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
!define IWANTTODEBUG<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
!ifdef IWANTTODEBUG<br />
  SetCompressor off<br />
!else<br />
  SetCompress lzma<br />
!endif<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
this will speed up your script development a lot...</div></div><hr />

last post here was from last year and there were a lot of changes since then. i recognize with amd fx cpu and vista 32-bit that the compiler still not use both cores. according to taskmanager it stops at 50% which is one of two cores.<br />
<br />
is there a planning for bring support for multiple cores, maybe in next release of nsis?<br />
<br />
think about how fast the compiler could be on a quad core machine.. :D</div></div><hr />

The TODO list on the CVS repository is over 11 months old so I'm not sure what's next for NSIS.<br />

Making the entire compiler multithreaded would require much more work. It's planned, but there are a lot of plans.</div></div><hr />

Did anything happen with this?<br />

That's unfortunate. With all of the multi-core boxes out there, I think this would be a great feature. I regularly compile installers with 100+ MB of source files, and it's sad to have three of my four cores idle when doing so.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dandaman32</div><div class="date">4th August 2009, 04:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Try using CopyFiles, SetCompress off, or building &quot;skeleton&quot; installers that include all the logic but don't actually install any data. I tend to go with the skeleton installers, to reduce disk I/O and make the actual installation process go faster as well as the compilation.<br />
