<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MichaelFlya</div><div class="date">6th June 2005, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Well &quot;The more I know the more I find out I don't know&quot;.<br />
<br />
Never saw an Example on this. I'll try my best to<br />
explain my problem. If you can help me please do<br />
so.<br />
<br />
Take in mind these sections.<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Section one&quot; Section1<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Section two&quot; Section2<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section /o &quot;Section three&quot; Section3<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Section four&quot; Section4<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Section five&quot; Section5<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Ok Function .onSelChange should work for this.<br />
I would want it to check every time something<br />
is selected or unselected.<br />
<br />
I simply need to say when Section three is selected<br />
unselect Section two and when the user selects<br />
section two it will unselect section three.<br />
<br />
This code does that.<br />
<br />
Function .onSelChange<br />
  !insertmacro StartRadioButtons $1<br />
    !insertmacro RadioButton ${Section2}<br />
    !insertmacro RadioButton ${section3}<br />
  !insertmacro EndRadioButtons<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
It made things happen I never intended. After clicking any<br />
check box it would unselect section one. Also it wouldn't<br />
let me unselect section two and section three to not install<br />
either one. It made section two and three lock in to either<br />
one or the other. It also on first click on Section three it<br />
doesn't unselect Section two.<br />
<br />
Reasons I have two installations and I can only allow one<br />
or the other. I still want the user to be able to decide not<br />
to install both Sections two and three.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of better code?<br />
<br />
Can this be done with SectionSetFlags and SectionGetFlags<br />
with some sort of &quot;if&quot; Statement some how?<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need me to explain more.<br />
I have attached a script that replicates my problem.<br />

I knew that was part of it. I just didn't include it for<br />
some reason. That helps a every issue actually, but<br />
one. The only thing I need now is to have it to where<br />
I can unselect them both, so the user will be able to<br />
choose to not install either one.<br />
