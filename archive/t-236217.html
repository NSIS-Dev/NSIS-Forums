<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RasJani</div><div class="date">23rd January 2006, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I have slight problems doing installation of a network protocol as the InstDrv plugin doesnt seem to support installing drivers without hardware..<br />
<br />
Workaround i was thinking is that i use snetcfg (supplied with winddk) to execute my inf's so that the driver gets installed (and it does)<br />
<br />
Now, the problem is snetcfg.exe doesnt come with windows machines so i have to supply it myself but i wouldnt want it to be on the filesystem but attached to the uninstaller similary as its attached to the installer executable. Is this possible ?<br />
<br />
Workaround for this is ofcourse saving the snetcfg to the INSTDIR but for the time being i dont think thats what i want (also, i dont know yet about the possible licensing issues)<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone have pointers on installing network protocols via other methods (the protocol drivers &amp; inf files are done allready), i could use them since im basicly a linux coder and was introduced to this project And windows programming only 2 weeks ago =)</div></div><hr />
