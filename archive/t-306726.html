<br />
I have a rather old installer using MUI1/IO. Actually I just want to use Multiuser.nsh to keep in touch with latest requirements of our customer, but apparently it is a must to upgrade the code. I have used nsDialog and MUI2 in new installers but this concerns my oldest and largest installer using NSIS.<br />
<br />
I read the upgrade instructions in help of MUI, but especially the customizations in Welcome/Finish-Page would take a long time, since I hardly remember the IO stuff - it just works. <br />
<br />
Doing new installer with MUI2/MultiUser is the right way, but it seems to me, that developers need a choice, when they just need to include the MultiUser stuff in older installers using a lot of IO customizations.<br />
<br />
Is there a thread for my request or did some already provided this to the community?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

If you open up Contrib\Modern UI 2\Pages and open the Welcome.nsh and Finish.nsh then look for the Function &quot;${PRE}&quot;, you will find all the code to create the controls in there. You will also find all the control window handle variables MUI has defined which you can use yourself if need be in custom show function.<br />
