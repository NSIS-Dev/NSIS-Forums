<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grahama</div><div class="date">26th November 2004, 01:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a helluva time getting thru a client's corporate proxy network.. I have tried both inetLoad and nsisdl plugins to no avail<br />
<br />
the strange thing is...<br />
When I use:<br />
my mac powerbook OS X <br />
running Virtual PC for Win2k<br />
and my nsis installer app<br />
running on their ethernet connection<br />
<br />
I get thru....with no errors or problems<br />
<br />
When I run the same nsis installer on  their PC's, I do not get thru..and receive an error with inetload and/or nsisdl<br />
<br />
normally, my app runs flawlessly on normal non proxy PC's for 98,2000, and XP<br />
<br />
is there some kind of work-around I am missing?</div></div><hr />

<br />

Anyone else dealing with corporate networks?  Guess I could check out InstallShield.  Maybe the express version will be enough to get past this particular problem for corporations.  Everyone else gets the nsis version</div></div><hr />

For those that had any problems I simply told them to change their proxy settings until it worked!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grahama</div><div class="date">9th December 2004, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">ouch :(  These are definitely not smarters....just corporate drone types<br />
my project seems to work for everyone else...just not on the main client's system<br />
<br />
have there been proxy setting that have worked? Or, pitfalls to avoid?<br />
<br />
also, here is one strange issue that might point to a solution:<br />
my powerbook DHCP'd into their network works fine with the nsis app...<br />
I am running Virtual PC [XP,2000,and 98] on my apple powerbook<br />
<br />
their own PC computers hooked into their networks are not able to download the files the nsis app is requesting<br />
<br />
strange stuff...but a definite road block as far as they are concerned</div></div><hr />
