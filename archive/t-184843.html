<br />
I already have used the search-function and it seems that the only solution for my problem is an INI-file or manual entering.<br />
<br />
I want to create an installer for an application, which includes 238 small files :-)<br />
<br />
I'm installing it via:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\AppName&quot;<br />
File /R subdirectory\*.*<br />
<br />
<br />
Alright, I only want to uninstall the files, which have got installed.<br />
AFAIK I can only do it that way:<br />
<br />
DELETE &quot;file1&quot;<br />
DELETE &quot;file2&quot;<br />
...<br />
DELETE &quot;file237&quot;<br />
DELETE &quot;file238&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
Damn ... that would be much code.<br />
Does anyone here still have an overview over the posting and could post a solution or link?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tobias</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK, nobody developped an automated process to remove only the installed files.. (I started to work on such a log system a while ago but there is still stuff to fix and I can't find some time to work on it.. ).<br />
<br />
So you'll have to code it yourself :D<br />

In your case you could write a function that performs a search in your input directory to log all the files and folders in an 'ini' file (relative paths). Then during the uninstallation, you just have to remove all the logged files, prepending the installation path defined at runtime. <br />
<br />
I hope that helps :)<br />
