<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xbarns</div><div class="date">8th August 2007, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone, <br />
<br />
very nice forum here. I have achieved a lot in NSIS through reading here. <br />
<br />
My current problem proves to be a little to much for me (or i am just a little stupid) <br />
<br />
I am going at the task of making a user member of the local Administrators group using &quot;net localgroup &gt;Administrators group&gt; &lt;Username&gt; /ADD&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem now is that depending on the language of the OS that group is named different (English: Administrators, German: Administratoren, French: Administrateurs and so on) <br />
So i though i use the SID (S-1-5-32-544) for the Administrators group since that SID is the same no matter what language the OS has. <br />
<br />
So i created a little VBS Script that queries WMI to find out the name of the Administrators group, which works fine.....<br />
<br />
The VBS Script writes its result to stdout, and this is where i do not get farther, i use: <br />
<br />
<br />
nsExec::ExecToStack 'wscript.exe $PLUGINSDIR\\GetAdminGroupName.vbs'<br />
Pop $0<br />
MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION|MB_DEFBUTTON1  $0<br />
 <br />
<br />
to test if i get the groupname wich i don't i get a nice little '0' telling me my script executed nicely (which is not bad either but not quite what i want). <br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to get to stdout of my VBS ? I guess i could take the detour and create a file that contains what i want, but i would like to do it with stdout. <br />
<br />
I have checked various plugins (Exec_CMD, Exec_Dos) and most of the documentation as well as the forum, to no avail. If i have overlooked something please just point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
