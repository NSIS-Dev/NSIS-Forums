<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mhoydis</div><div class="date">22nd January 2007, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to make an NSIS script that will compile in 2 different file structures.  I think the /nonfatal switch for File is what I want, however it does not seem to work recursively?  Unless I'm making a stupid mistake?<br />
<br />
Explanation...<br />
I want to be able to use the File command, recursively, and nonfatally.<br />
I want to be able to do something like...<br />
File /r &quot;../STUFF/*.*&quot;<br />
and have it just be ignored if the STUFF directory does not exists, OR if the STUFF directory is empty.  If STUFF is present and does contain files I want them to be compressed and added to my archive.<br />
<br />
File /r /nonfatal &quot;../STUFF/*.*&quot; does not seem to work!!  It presents the &quot;no files found&quot; error at compilation.<br />
<br />
What kind of logic can I write that would be able to test if a file/directory, relative to the compiler, is present?  IfFileExists will not work for me because it is doing a compare of the end-user situation at runtime, and I require this kind of logic at the compiler.  I'm familiar with {If} and all that logic, but how to I ask it about files relative to the compiler?<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If /nonfatal switch was designed to operate with /r (recursively) then this code would produce an empty (without files to install) installer.<br />
Why not just open windows explorer and see if ../STUFF/ exists?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I agree.  This does not seem to be the case.<br />

yeeeaaahhh see I know ../STUFF/ is empty.  The act of determining if it exists or empty isn't for my own edification.  I need the script to be flexible enough to determine this by itself.<br />
(unless you mean there's a way to use &quot;windows explorer&quot; though scripting means to do this?  If so, please elaborate.)</div></div><hr />

I see... apologies my mistake</div></div><hr />

<br />
File /r /nonfatal &quot;../STUFF/*.*&quot; does NOT work.  &quot;no files found&quot; error during compile.<br />
<br />
File /nonfatal /r &quot;../STUFF/*.*&quot; DOES work!!  This allows for recursive inclusion of files or directories which may not exist.<br />
<br />
Evidently the order of the switches is very important.<br />
<br />
le sigh.<br />
