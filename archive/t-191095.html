<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haigha</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to add an image that doesn't scale well using MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP.<br />
<br />
The problem I encountered is when I run my installer using 1280x1024 and 1024x768 the bitmap is not the same size.  Is there a setting to make the bitmap size fixed and set any scaled background to a particular color?<br />
<br />
If so, is there a preferred size for the bitmap?<br />
<br />
I also looked at the sample which uses the branding image but I prefer to use the MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP if it can work.<br />
<br />
If it can't, what functions do I create so that my branding image will display on my Welcome, License, and Finish pages at all resoutions?<br />
<br />
The branding sample doesn't follow what the MUI wizard in HM NIS Edit outputs and I read that I can't set up the branding image in .onInit.<br />
<br />
Here's what I've come up with on the branding so far but I think the Page license licenseImage part is wrong.<br />
<br />
!macro BIMAGE IMAGE PARMS<br />
Push $0<br />
GetTempFileName $0<br />
File /oname=$0 &quot;${IMAGE}&quot;<br />
SetBrandingImage ${PARMS} $0<br />
Delete $0<br />
Pop $0<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
AddBrandingImage left 191<br />
<br />
Page license licenseImage<br />
Function licenseImage<br />
!insertmacro BIMAGE &quot;.\setup.bmp&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the MUI ReadMe:<br />
<br />
MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP bmp_file<br />
Bitmap for the Welcome page and the Finish page (recommended size: 164x314 pixels).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haigha</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt; Does your Welcome/Finish page bitmap use the recommended size?<br />
<br />
I started with that (I copied one of the bitmaps from the C:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Graphics\Wizard<br />
 folder).  However, even those get distorted.  My next step was to get the dimensions on the system I was testing on (1280x1024) and I came up with 191x291 using PSP and saw no strectching or distortion in the text in the bitamp.  However, when I went to test this on a 1024x768 monitor it looked horrible.<br />
<br />
I also didn't find MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP in the MUI read me and searching came up with nothing.  What section is it in?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haigha</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I found it in the MUI readme.  I poked around before posting but didn't find it (and search doesn't work on the collapsed sections apparently).<br />
<br />
I found MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP_NOSTRETCH which will probably do what I need although it looks like the background of my bitmap will need to be white.  It looks odd with the current color when it is clipped.<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying pengyou.</div></div><hr />
