<br />
I'm new to NSIS.  I started investigating the system based on a post I found for creating an NSIS installer that would check for Adobe Air and install it if it wasn't installed or install a newer version if an older version was installed.  This script then launched the an air application installer.  I tried this and it worked.<br />
<br />
But my client wants to run the AIR application directly from the CD once AIR is installed.  I tried ammending the script to launch the exe but it appears that the command to run the exe launches before AIR installation is complete.  <br />
<br />
I'd be grateful for any help you may be able to give me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">6th December 2011, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume you're using ExecWait to run the AIR installer. And I assume that after that you're using Exec, or something similar, to launch the installed software.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, then you probably need to execwait the AIR installer including its child processes. You could try using this: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ExecWait_and_waiting_for_child_processes_with_Job_Objects</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply-- I really appreciate your help.  As far as I can tell it's working like a charm.</div></div><hr />
