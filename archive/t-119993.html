<br />
How can Register and EXE as a Service?  (I think the way I would do this manually is in the command line I would go to the directory where myEXE is and type myEXE -install)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ExecWait '&quot;$INSTDIR\file.exe&quot; install'<br />
<br />
This assumes you put it in $INSTDIR. If you want to capture the output use nsExec (Contrib\nsExec).</div></div><hr />
