<br />
New user, first time poster. <br />
<br />
I have an NSIS installer that installs access files. The files are in MS Access 2013, and are signed (so they are in .accdc format). I am just wondering if anyone has had success opening signed access files with NSIS. I ask because when you open an access .accdc file, you are systematically prompted for a location to store the resulting .accdb file, after which the file opens. I am being told that this is not possible in NSIS but I am dubious. I could just distribute the accdb files, but would rather have the signed file distributed. Does anyone know how to handle this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Don</div></div><hr />

<br />
For b) you can use use ShellExecute and &quot;open&quot; verb to execute application associated with .accdb extension.</div></div><hr />
