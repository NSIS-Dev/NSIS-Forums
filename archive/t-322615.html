<br />
I'm quite a newbie to NSIS and I am trying to check whether the PostgreSQL service is running, in which case I would go ahead and execute a certain piece of code, otherwise I would wait for 1 minute for the process to start, checking every second. Basically it would be a while loop, exit condition being either end of time either the desired process status.<br />
<br />
<br />
$5 = 0<br />
$6 = 0<br />
 <br />
PGServiceCheck:<br />
<br />
${If} $5 == 60<br />
  Goto PGServiceEnd<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
 SimpleSC::GetServiceStatus &quot;postgresql-8.4&quot;<br />
 Pop $0 ; returns an errorcode (&lt;&gt;0) otherwise success (0)<br />
 Pop $1 ; return the status of the service (See &quot;service_status&quot; in the parameters)<br />
<br />
${If} $0 == 0  <br />
  $6 = 1<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
${If} $6 == 1<br />
  Goto PGServiceEnd<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
IntOp $5 $5 + 1<br />
Sleep 1000<br />
<br />
PGServiceEnd: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would really like to know if this is the/a correct approach.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

${For} $R0 1 60<br />
  SimpleSC::GetServiceStatus &quot;postgresql-8.4&quot;<br />
  Pop $R1<br />
  Pop $R2<br />
  ${If} $R1 == 0<br />
  ${AndIf} $R2 == 4 ; SERVICE_RUNNING<br />
    ${Break}<br />
  ${EndIf}<br />
  Sleep 1000<br />
${Next}You haven't thought about an action to take if the service is never started. You could have this after the loop:${If} $R0 == 61<br />
  # handle error<br />
  #<br />
  Abort<br />
${EndIf}Stu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preotul</div><div class="date">22nd September 2010, 06:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey! big thanks! :) ... Unfortunately I'm not new to programming, just very tired to look up all the statements, instructions and functions I needed when I wrote the installer.<br />
<br />
This was everything I knew of the GetServiceStatus<br />
<br />
; Get the current status of a service<br />
  SimpleSC::GetServiceStatus &quot;MyService&quot;<br />
  Pop $0 ; returns an errorcode (&lt;&gt;0) otherwise success (0)<br />
  Pop $1 ; return the status of the service (See &quot;service_status&quot; in the parameters)<br />
<br />
 so for some reason I assumed that it returns 1 in $0 when status is running and anything else if it fails, popping the info in $1. Basically I get a 0 in $0 when I get a status from the service and it pops a 4 in $1 if the status is running.<br />
Also, now I know how the for statement looks like :D, and of course a for or a while is the best choice for this. <br />
<br />
In case I get out after 60 seconds I wont execute the code that follows, but that I didn't include that in the present code. As a matter of fact I forgot some things in the code I wrote (the jump backwards) so I can see why you assumed I was new to programming ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, big thanks :)</div></div><hr />
