Write a string to the registry. See WriteRegExpandStr for more details.NSIS documentation for WriteRegExpandStr says &quot;Write a string to the registry&quot; and it has the same exact syntax.<br />
<br />
Are WriteRegStr and WriteRegExpandStr synonyms?<br />
<br />
If not, what is the difference between the two?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Chris</div></div><hr />

Sorry for my ignorance but what does &quot;expanded&quot; mean?<br />
<br />
Also, if WriteRegExpandStr is different from WriteRegStr, why doesn't the documentation say so?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">29th July 2008, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">check the code sample I wrote.  Essentially it means that if an application reads the REG_EXPAND_SZ registry key using the proper APIs, instead of getting &quot;%WINDIR%\notepad.exe&quot;, it will get the 'expanded' result of, for example, &quot;c:\winxp\notepad.exe&quot;.<br />
<br />
The %WINDIR% being a variable, if you will, that may differ depending on the exact windows installation, the current user logged in, etc.<br />
<br />
The documentation probably doesn't mention they're different because it will only matter to those users who install an application that requires a REG_EXPAND_SZ string to be written out by the installer; presumably, you'd already know this requirement, look up how to write an expanded registry key, and then use the appropriate function from there :)</div></div><hr />

The main thing I was missing was the reference to REG_EXPAND_SZ. You explained it so well. Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />
