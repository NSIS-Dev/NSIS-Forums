<br />
I have a question:<br />
<br />
I am trying to insert a custom page in an installer which will do the following at some point during the installation (doesn't matter when it happens as long as it happens)<br />
<br />
-5 radio buttons which are mutually exclusive (I have seen this: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/RadioButtons  <br />
but that is not what I want. Each choice should not lead to a new section. Instead they should perform the following function:<br />
-depending on which radio button is selected, an autoexec.cfg enclosed in the installation needs to have one of 5 different lines altered <br />
OR<br />
one of 5 different versions of the autoexec included in the installer should be installed, the others discarded. Not sure how that would work because they would all need to have the same name in the same place.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter which of the above takes place, it just needs to happen somehow. I am using HM NIS Edit 2.0 and have a full installer working, I just need this last step.<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

Thanks but are there any examples that show either process I've outlined above?</div></div><hr />
