<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbrook</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 01:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I started using NSIS for patches to my software and now I absolutely love it.  Very solid - just plain works!<br />
<br />
However, I have a problem.  A LARGE percentage of my users are AOL users.  I consistently have reports of problems with the download of my files created with NSIS ... this is the text of the error.<br />
<br />
NSIS Error Installer verification failed.  This could be the result of an incomplete download, a failing disc, or (possibly) corruption from a virus.  you can try to force an install using the NCRC command line switch but it is NOT recommended..<br />
<br />
I know, it sounds like they just need to try the download again, however I have some very persistant users who have sat and watched the download ... and still have not been able to get the file to work, I end up sending the software on CD.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else experienced this?  Might it help to try one of the other compression routines?  I let it build using the default.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be VERY welcome.</div></div><hr />

If it is the AOL browser, then tell them to download using Download Accelerator Plus (http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-3282264-100-6289136.html?tag=st.dl.3282264.unav.0) or tell them to use Internet Explorer or Netscape Navagator/Mozilla and not to use the AOL browser. It also depends on the service provider ... AOL is not a good provider<br />

<br />
Who just said that??? ;) :D <br />

However, that is not a good answer to give someone who want's to buy my software ... 'sorry you have a sucky ISP'.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to turn of the CRC check programmatically?  Is that a bad idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
will disable the crc.<br />
<br />
This IS a bad idea, because if the installer is corrupt, it'll try and install anyway.<br />
