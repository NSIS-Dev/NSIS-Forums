<br />
are there another ways to save the control state without having to write ${NSD_GetState} like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Function InstallTypePageLeave<br />
	${NSD_GetState} $rdoDev $rdoDev_State<br />
	${NSD_GetState} $rdoProd $rdoProd_State<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
can nsis autosave it when switching to another page like innosetup does?<br />
im just curious if it will be possible in the next version of nsis.<br />
<br />
thank you so much!</div></div><hr />

Not everyone will want the state to be saved automatically, after all. This can be done very easily manually, so there's no point in automating it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am creating an installer which requires a lot of custom forms (for now 2 and will increase to 5), each of them will have 2-4 text controls and 2 or 3 checkboxes which have their own event handlers.<br />
imagine how long the codes will. i'm not lazy, i'm just thinking the codes will be harder to read and maintenance.</div></div><hr />

If you automate it, some people will not be very happy, because suddenly the installer is doing something without their asking for it!<br />

Have you considered using macros or functions? They were invented for code simplification, you know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think it would better if the installer have an option whether you want to autosave the control's states or not. so everybody would be very happy :D<br />

<br />
i haven't learnt how to use macro.<br />
is it possible to save all control's states using a macro so i can reuse it in another installation project?</div></div><hr />

But if you have never used InstallOptions before then you'll have to learn how to use it, so it may not be the best solution for you.</div></div><hr />

It supports some event handlers - but pretty limited.  IntallOptions2 and InstallOptionsEx support more events; but still nowhere near as flexible as NSDialogs.. so it'd depend on your exact needs.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd say setting up page leave/enter function to store/restore the settings isn't all that painful and makes you more aware of your custom pages' functionality.</div></div><hr />
