<br />
The only Setup and Deploy package I have ever used is VB6 P&amp;D 'Package' to install Windows Forms applications. <br />
<br />
I would like to move to VB 2008 Express but the OneClick tool is hopelessly inadequate for my needs.<br />
<br />
I've been reading the NSIS material but I am missing the general concepts of how to use it.<br />
<br />
I've read something about Modern UI 2... which if I understand the documentation correctly is something similar to what I am used to.  Yet I don't see it after installing NSIS.<br />
<br />
Any help here would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hungryOrb</div><div class="date">14th April 2008, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I can recommend that you download and install HM NIS Edit (http://http://hmne.sourceforge.net/)!<br />
<br />
This will first help you to set up the basic structure for your average installer with a useful wizard. After which, much can be made sense of. After that, post individual problems ;]<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm about 10 minutes away from the original St. Helens :]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Original?  I actually live in Scappoose these days.  Work in St Helens.  (It's a long story. :))<br />
<br />
Downloaded HM NIS.  Fired it up.  Still stumped.  Isn't there a walk through for people who have no frame of reference? <br />
<br />
Say I have a hello world project I put together in VB 2008 Express.  In general what is the process to create a setup package with NSIS?<br />
<br />

Like Anders said, there are many examples that can help break you in, I've only used a couple myself, using the examples, and the HM NIS edit wizard, you can figure most of the stuff out! There is a manual inside the NSIS install which is reasonably helpful too, although sometimes, you'll have to wade through a lot of stuff to find what you want.<br />
<br />
P.S. The examples are all in the Program Files/NSIS/Examples folder. While the help file 'NSIS.chm' is the the main NSIS folder.</div></div><hr />
