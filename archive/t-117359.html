I hope that you will find it as useful as I do. It has automated backups, sheduled updates and a builtin updatecheck to make sure that the updated says update.<br />

Don't really care enough to fight with it...I think it worked the first time and hasnt' worked since :cry: <br />

<br />
As far as this program, works ok except I'd ask that it allow me to choose the NSIS path I wish (I keep 2 copies of NSIS installed, one B0 and one a7).  This defaults and overwrites my a7 one because that's the one that is &quot;installed&quot; and not just &quot;unzipped&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's much better to download a CVS client like TortoiseCVS. This will make sure that you download only the updated parts of the files and you always get the latest stuff. <br />
<br />
The new version will use CVS to get the newest files. I am working on it now and it should be released within the next day. You will be able to run UpdateCheck and update if NSISUpdate is installed.</div></div><hr />

You can go to http://nsisupdate.phpinr.com and update or if you have NSIS Update install just go to Update Check on the start menu under NSIS Update.<br />

I pretty sure that at.exe is install with ie5 with win98 because that is when the schedule tasks appeared on my computer. I use windows xp and it works fine but it was build on NT. I am going to check on my dads computer this morning to see if it exists. if you have better ideals let me know.<br />
<br />
Where am i using the zlib/libpng license at? and the src is availible to the public per request until i get my cvs server up. <br />
<br />
The last not no it doesnt say that is downloading the last dev version. That was kinda implied 'Keep NSIS Updated! Bleeding Edge Installer Development' but i will make it known that you are about to download a dev version.<br />
<br />
Please if you have more question comments let me know or if you want to help let me that too.</div></div><hr />

Hello AndiG,<br />
<br />
I havent had any problems with it crashing but if it did i need to know what OS, programs running, was it downloading TVCS or was it waiting for you to install TCVS, have you reboot and then reinstalled what the message was when it crashed. <br />
<br />
if you got the message &quot;You have the current version' you where runing UpdateCheck this checks to see if there are any new updates to the program hints NSIS Update v1.3 so the software was installed.<br />
<br />
If you are trying to update NSIS then you need to run NSIS Update.</div></div><hr />

Both of my Windows 98 machines with Internet Explorer 6 have no at command.<br />
<br />
Where am i using the zlib/libpng license at? and the src is availible to the public per request until i get my cvs server up. <br />
<br />
You copied the license from NSIS and changed the copyright name. The license NSIS uses is zlib/libpng. All of the 3 points at the bottom of the license is about open source... Just made me wonder :)</div></div><hr />

If you have any ideals or suggestions I would like to know.<br />

CVS updating works strange - it doesn't skip older files, but it redownloads them adding ? to their icon...<br />
Strange. <br />
<br />
Yes that was a technical flaw in version 1.1 - 1.2 to make TortoiseCVS update files i have to create the Root, Repository, Entries File.<br />
<br />
With me so far, the Entries has a list of Files &amp; Directories and there status. those files where need to be in the NSIS folder under CVS. the old version 1.1 and 1.2 copied a blank Entries file over everytime. this is before I knew was i was doing as if i know now!<br />
<br />
In the new version that will be release real soon maybe as soon as tomorrow features a lot of new checks as with the CVS Entries file. This check detect if the file exists and if not it creates it.<br />
<br />
Now back to the ? mark problem, the Entries was overwritten everytime so the CVS thought that there was a error and moved and download a new version everytime. this means that everytime NSIS Update was ran it update the file in the root NSIS directory.<br />
<br />
With the new version the check detect the file and doesnt override the Entries and it just does a cvs update. This mean if you ran NSIS Update 2 times in a row on the second time it wouldnt update any files because the Entries file was correct and the version matched.<br />
<br />
I hope I didnt Confuse you!<br />
<br />
I am really sorry about doing that I am trying to intergrate my program into a program I new nothing about until yesterday. I have spend the last 14hours working on fixing all the little bugs that bugged me including that one. I guess I thought no one would see that. I just that doesnt make me less of a person. Just foolish<br />

Quite impressed by what you've created, it looks quite professional. I can't really comment on how well it works as I use Tortoise-CVS to sync to the latest NSIS, I downloaded your program out of curiosity rather than need. Comments thus far on this thread seem favourable however, well done.<br />

Thanks. On that topic the archive will be closing at that location soon, a new one will be up to replace it but not on that server. The new one is being finalised at the moment and I and/or KiCHiK will post here when it's ready.</div></div><hr />

I have spent lost of time cleaning the code and as I improve this program I am contantly learning better way to execute code. I have also worked on a couple features as well. The New Features include:<br />
<br />
New Control Panel<br />
http://nsisupdate.phpinr.com/images/newcp.png <br />
Okay, there want a control panel before but there was start menu links this link often resulted in wrong direction. eg: Run 'NSIS Update' and people would run 'Update Check' it was misleading. I dont know how many time I accidently uninstall 'NSIS Update' either. And what if you want to Reinstall 'NSIS Update'.<br />
<br />
New Name:<br />
The offical Package Name is NSISUpdate-vVersion.exe (Request: SunJammer)<br />

You mentioned the source was online. I'm interested in how you are accomplishing this. Are you coding in NSIS, C or combination of the two?  Last I used NSIS it was 1.62.  Has NSIS matured enough to do all this.<br />

Anyway, cool tool.  Liking it a lot.  Love to look at source.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Techkid</div><div class="date">5th January 2003, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Everyone,<br />
<br />
I have several things to talk about so lets get started.<br />
<br />
First and most IMPORTANT I had a harddrive failure. This drive was my Backup Drive and Projects Drive. In the event something would happen to my C: drive the D: drive store all my data. So NSIS Update code was lost after hours of trying to retrive data from my 80gb hard that register as 9.4gb and had 2gb free, I gave up. It wasnt a Total failure though the code was in the cvs, well some of it, The UI ans stuff wherent but I was going to create a new UI anyway.<br />
<br />
Second I just visit the NEW NSIS Archive and NSIS Update is there, this is awesome. I really like the new archive. <br />
<br />
Third It will be a few days before I will start coding on NSIS Update. I have some really code ideas for NSIS Update Also I am working on a solution for the Sheduler on none NT machines. The new code was kinda getting bloaty at 254kb need to cut that down. I guess the Hard Drive failure wasnt such a bad thing ( Okay it was, I lost everything music, videos, websites, projects, backups, dvds) arrrrg!<br />
<br />
A Very Upset,<br />

Just one small request.. include an option not to create NSIS program shortcuts when NSIS is automatically installed.  Also, is there a good reason why the NSIS shortcuts folder is opened after installation?  <br />
<br />
I will consider making a option to delete the NSIS Shortcuts folder. <br />
<br />
The reason that the NSIS Shortcuts folder is open is because that is specified in the makeNSIS.nsi file, i cant do any thing about this how NSIS Update should be automaticly closing it. If NSIS Update is failing to close the NSIS Shortcuts folder then let me know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an idea: Some files are not included in the NSIS setup when it's created, like TODO.txt. TODO.txt, for example, is being downloaded, but cannot be viewed when NSIS Updater completes, because NSIS Updater destroys all the downloaded files.<br />
<br />
Another idea: I have ISDN internet at home :rolleyes:, and it's not a permanent connection. Couldn't NSIS Sceduler be modified to download the updates automatically when connected (for example, once a day if connected).<br />
<br />
And: I'd like a Cancel button on the NSIS Updater window. When I don't hav the time to download a large amount of files, I can click Cancel to interrupt.<br />
<br />
Also: The progressbar should also fill up when downloading.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion: Make it possible to set that NSIS Updater asks before connecting and downloading files. Since I have a shared connection, and propably it is configured wrong, it automatically connects to the internet when a program requests it, without asking (that's a Windows problem, not NSIS Updater's).<br />
<br />
Another suggestion: A reference to the configuration of NSIS Updater in the Controlpanel.<br />
<br />
The next suggestion: A program which covers all the NSIS Updater programs + NSIS programs/files/source code/exaples. For example:<br />
A window with ability to open:<br />
- NSIS Updater<br />
- NSIS Sceduler<br />
- NSIS Updater History<br />
- NSIS folder<br />
- Examples folder<br />
- etc...<br />
which can be called from an icon from the taskbar.<br />
<br />
These are just idea's/suggestion's/comments. Don't be mad at me if such a function is already available/not possible etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
NSIS Update doesnt destroy the files unless you have Clear Cache on. The files are hidden in the Install Directory\NSIS\.<br />
<br />
Another idea: I have ISDN internet at home :rolleyes:, and it's not a permanent connection. Couldn't NSIS Sceduler be modified to download the updates automatically when connected (for example, once a day if connected).<br />
<br />
I can make this check to see if you connected if no Quit.<br />
<br />
And: I'd like a Cancel button on the NSIS Updater window. When I don't hav the time to download a large amount of files, I can click Cancel to interrupt.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can do here is just kill NSIS Update it will resume where it left off if 'Clear Cache' isnt enabled. This is a limitation of NSIS once INSTFIles beings you can cancel until done.<br />
<br />
Also: The progressbar should also fill up when downloading.<br />
<br />
This is controled by NSIS Update. <br />
<br />
Just a suggestion: Make it possible to set that NSIS Updater asks before connecting and downloading files. Since I have a shared connection, and propably it is configured wrong, it automatically connects to the internet when a program requests it, without asking (that's a Windows problem, not NSIS Updater's).<br />
<br />
I not sure about this the ideal is that if your connected it download the files and build NSIS for you if not then it just abort and lets you know. Now if you have IE or Windows to connect on no connection then that is something maybe you should change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another suggestion: A reference to the configuration of NSIS Updater in the Controlpanel.<br />
<br />
This is a idea, I havent done any Control Panel work but I sure it cant be that hard. I will look into this because there really need to be a way to change configuration will out edit the config file ( on the other hand there is really good documentation on editing the config file )<br />
<br />
<br />
The next suggestion: A program which covers all the NSIS Updater programs + NSIS programs/files/source code/exaples. For example:<br />
A window with ability to open:<br />

- NSIS Updater History<br />
- NSIS folder<br />
- Examples folder<br />
- etc...<br />
which can be called from an icon from the taskbar.<br />
<br />
The cvs has all the code for NSIS Update. I am not really sure what your wanting here.<br />
<br />
These are just idea's/suggestion's/comments. Don't be mad at me if such a function is already available/not possible etc...  <br />
<br />
Bad virtlink, doing exactly what I asked. heh, I ask for you guy what you would like to see and you doing it so how can I be mad.<br />

I meant with this the following: Imagine an icon on the taskbar (or just in the startmenu), that starts a program or opens a folder with the ability to start NSIS Updater, NSIS Sceduler, NSIS Updater History, the NSIS folder etc...<br />
<br />
Might be a stupid idea, that's where the last couple of lines were for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using VB or C# its possible to create DLLs.  The problem is the user would have to have the runtime installed for them to work (aka VB runtime, or .net runtime).  You need to write plugins in a language that can be compiled as a standalone dll with no dependancies that aren't already included on all windows machines.  So, you can use C,c++, or pascal.  There are other languages, but those 3 are the main 3 that can be compiled as standalone dlls.</div></div><hr />

Well I am working on NSIS Update right now and I just rewrote the core of NSIS Update, man that was a mess. It now has a better debuger you can see what is happing with NSIS Update if you having problems. I added AutoClose (on|off), if NSIS Update errors while Updating it will turn the debuger on. If NSIS Update is updating CVS and cant find CVS95.exe it will tell you to Reinstall NSIS Update. Changed the way NSIS Update Output the Log was 'U NSIS\!Install.bat' now it is 'U !Install.bat'. I have added No Startmenu Shortcuts (also if this is turned off NSIS Update will try closing NSIS shortcuts window).<br />
<br />
Scheduler:<br />
I am going to start working on it soon, I want to do some stuff with dialer, like Connect if not connected if we dialed then disconnect on finish. I am not sure how sucessful this will be. well see!<br />

The empty password error shouldnt effect the cvs update as there is no password for the cvs account. If you clear the cvs cache that error should go away. you can do this 2 ways, goto to the NSIS Update Control Panel then Configuration check Clear CVS Cache and run nsis update after a complete cvs update it will delete the cache then all you need to do is turn that option off. Run NSIS Update again and the error should be gone.<br />
<br />
If NSIS Update isnt updating then let me know.<br />

With this error it could never finish.<br />
After deleting the contents of the NSIS folder NSIS Update appears to be working.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

The browser always gave me &quot;TCP_ERROR&quot;. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have TortoiseCVS 1.4 (release) installed and i get this error message when NSIS Try to update: &quot;empty file list disallowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
I I run TortoiseCVS by hand it works. This problem is the same for all versions of TortoiseCVS 1.5 (even RC1-RC5).<br />
<br />
Can you update the NSIS to work with this because I need a newer TortoiseCVS because I use it in other projects.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
Are you using the included NSIS Update version?</div></div><hr />
