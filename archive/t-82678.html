<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bballer182</div><div class="date">28th March 2002, 07:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The other day i thought that it would nice that when i login to my Win2k machine that i would be kind of cool to have IE and one of my winamp3 playlists startup automatically. So i first tried to do this with a batch file but the problem with that was that it would execute the first app which ever one it was but wouldn't execute the second until the first was closed. But then i had a bright idea right when i was getting ready to scrap the whole idea. I use NSIS for some other apps that i distribute and the Exec command so i made a quick script<br />
<br />
CRCCheck off<br />
SilentInstall silent<br />
OutFile &quot;IE and Winamp.exe&quot;<br />
icon &quot;biz.ico&quot;<br />
Section running<br />
execShell open &quot;Z:\playlists\coolwa3.bpl&quot;<br />
exec &quot;F:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
and this solved the little prob. so thank nsis for the alternative to a batch file. <br />
<br />
If i did want to do the batch file again how could i do that with the given info that i have provided in the nsis script above? any sugggestions would be appriciated!:)</div></div><hr />

It is awesome.<br />

But couldn't you have just put those items in the startup folder? (perhaps that is not the correct term, but it will auto-start any app.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bballer182</div><div class="date">31st March 2002, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">i guess that i missworded my first post./<br />
 I meant to say that when i am on my puter and already logged on and have already been doing of there stuff, then when i decide to run IE and open a playlist in winamp3. How would i do that with a batch file. just to see if it runs fast than NSIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SQwerl</div><div class="date">1st April 2002, 07:17</div></div><div class="posttext">easy. sort of anyway :)<br />
For winamp 2* play lists<br />
<br />
start &quot;c:/program files/winamp/winamp.exe&quot; MySongs.m3u<br />
start iexplore.exe<br />
<br />
Worked just fine. Then I switched over to Winamp3. Windows didn't recognize the song list extension &quot;bpl&quot;. So I got an error. But it should work, if windows recognizes which prog to open that file type with.<br />
I am using XP Pro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bballer182</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 01:18</div></div><div class="posttext">thanx SQwerl that worked great, but NSIS stills starts things faster than the batch what should i use?<br />
<br />
The NSIS is a little bigger in file size but way faster<br />
The Batch File is way smaller but a little slower than NSIS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SQwerl</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I noticed it was slow when I tried it.<br />
<br />
If you have space to spare, stay with NSIS definitely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bballer182</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 00:55</div></div><div class="posttext">yeh plenty of room sticking with NSIS:) ;) :winamp: :D :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">6th April 2002, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Smile2Me -- I just visited your homepage and noticed you were doing an econometrics and Operational Research course .. <br />
I am starting a masters in Mathematics, Operational Research and Economics this September at Warwick (in the UK) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">7th April 2002, 08:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi pjw62,<br />
<br />
it's nice to meet a fellow Econometrics &amp; OR student. But this is not really the place to chat about Econometrics, so if you want, you can contact me about it by e-mail.<br />
<br />
BTW, what's your field of interest?<br />
<br />
Good luck with Econometrics, have fun,<br />
greetz, Hendri.</div></div><hr />
