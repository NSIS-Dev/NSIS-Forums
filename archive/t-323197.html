<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netsurfer24</div><div class="date">17th October 2010, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am looking for an easy solution or best method to let my banner text blink.<br />
<br />
As a certain part of my installer the user has the option to do a full HDD scan (which may take several minutes). So after clicking the button which starts the scan I hide the main installer window and show a banner instead (visible in the taskbar, stays always on top).<br />
<br />
The banner text actually is only changed/ updated when a certain entry is found. Now I would like to have the first text line to blink so that the user knows that the application is still working and has not hung up.<br />
<br />
I already tried the nsDialog timer (does not work - I guess due to the hide of the window) and I also do not want to use another banner (plugin).<br />
<br />
Can anybody give me a tip or a hint how to achieve this?<br />
Or what I possibly made wrong with timer?<br />
<br />
<br />
Addendum 1:<br />
I changed my UI and added a progressbar to the banner. Now the question is &quot;How to Create a Smooth Progress Bar control&quot; (like in http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsDialogs_FAQ#How_to_Create_a_Marquee_.28endless_loop.29_Progress_Bar_control)?<br />
<br />
Addendum 2:<br />
OK, I solved it. I found the solution in this thread: t-291517.html<br />

<br />
thanks but I solved it by using the &quot;normal&quot; banner (see addendum 2 above).<br />
Ah, still one additional question:<br />
In the post (linked in my first post) is written In Windows XP or later you can set the progress bar in maraquee mode.<br />
So what happens on NT/2000 systems?(Win &lt;= 98 does not matter as it is not supported by my installer anyway)<br />
Do I have to take care for those systems? May the code crash the installer or has it just no effect?<br />

<br />
So go ahead. No need to take care of these cases.</div></div><hr />
