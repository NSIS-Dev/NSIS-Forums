<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoopy55</div><div class="date">31st March 2008, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I belong to the Hooked on Forums' Sid Meier's Railroads! forum and am trying to simplify the loading of maps made by members.  We had one member writing a like installer, but work has gotten him very busy.<br />
<br />
What we have are maps with thumbnail DDS files (which can be converted to any other type for this) which we want the program to be able to use like a slide show, and when the user finds the map they want, they click a button and the program first removes one or two files from a previous map, opens a ZIP file and copies the one or two files from there into a folder in the games UserMaps folder, then drops to the desktop.<br />
<br />
I've been told it can be done, and with a example Installer I've written an Installer for one of my maps, but I'm really lost as to the hows of the programming.<br />
<br />
Would anyone be able and willing to tackle this?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this, and would understand if it was pulled.</div></div><hr />

I think the real task will be the slideshow, I have the code in my head, but not in the correct environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The files for the slide show can be placed anywhere.  There would be one folder andmaybe one FPK file.  If you need it, i can give you an Email to work it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
