<br />
I'm a begining NSIS user, and I really enjoy it. Great piece of free software. I'm in the process of porting some InstallShield stuff for the company I work in to it.<br />
<br />
However, I have a little problem: I try to use a custom page with the Modern UI, but the first time I get into a custom page, it's &quot;Back&quot; button behaves like the &quot;Next&quot; button.:( The second and subsequent times, it behaves correctly.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that my code was causing the problem, but I compiled the InstallOptions.nsi (in the NSIS distribution) and the custom pages exhibit the same behavior.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else has that problem ? I use NSIS 2.0.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

I found out the culprit: I was using a makensis.exe from the 05/08/2004 from a development snapshot, instead of the one from 01/26/2004 which was in the NSIS 2.0 distribution.<br />
<br />
That's why even the {$NSISDIR}\Examples\ModernUI\InstallOptions.nsi was failing to work properly.<br />
<br />
Rolling back to the correct makensis.exe cured all my problems.:D<br />
