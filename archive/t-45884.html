<br />
1/ How to pass DOS SET commands (SET CPH_POSTE=MONO for example) to the system during a setup process with NSIS and what is the script syntax (with Execshell i guess but...) ?<br />
<br />
2/ How to execute a program during the setup and in the same time open a text document side by side ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exec full_path_of_command_to_execute<br />
<br />
This command will execute the specfied program and continue. Note that the file specified must exist on the target system, not the compiling system. It is recommended that you do something like this '&quot;$INSTDIR\whatever.exe&quot; /PARAMETER /2 ETC whatever.dat' (so that the double quotes ensure correct running, even if $INSTDIR has a space in it. <br />
<br />
You have to put this (Exec as the command) and then the full_path_of_command_to_execute in &quot; &quot; in where ever you want it to run, but i don't know how to get two programs side by side hope it helps.</div></div><hr />
