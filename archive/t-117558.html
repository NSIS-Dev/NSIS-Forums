<br />
calling &quot;Abort&quot; from the .onGUIInit function appears to have no effect.<br />
<br />
is this a bug, or does Abort have some &quot;special&quot; meaning from .onGUIInit ?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
You quit the installer, use Quit. But it's better to use .onInit for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdenny</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The behavior i would expect is the same as in .onInit: abort the installer.<br />
<br />
Our installer needs to check if a previous version is installed, <br />
and if so, give the user a message box and then uninstall the previous version before installing the current version.<br />
<br />
In nsis 1.98, I was doing this in .onInit.  The observed behavior was: first the background screen would come up, then the message box, the user hits OK and we do the uninstall silently, it takes 10-15 seconds which is fine for us, we don't need a progress bar or anything, the hourglass icon is fine.<br />
<br />
In NSIS 2.0, with the same code, all the .onInit stuff happens *before* the background screen comes up, and there is not even an hourglass icon while the previous version is being removed.  The effect is that, for those 10-15 seconds it appears as if the installer is not running at all.<br />
<br />
Putting this logic in .onGUIInit instead of .onInit seemed to solve the problem, in fact the behavior is identical to what it was using .onInit in 1.98 -- except that i can't abort the installation if the user clicks &quot;no&quot; in my messagebox.<br />
<br />
Alternative approaches are possible, but i don't understand why you would want to have this one callback function from which it is impossible to programmatically abort the installation.<br />

I will make it so Abort will work too and I will also make it quit instantly and not even show the window as it does now (soon in CVS).</div></div><hr />
