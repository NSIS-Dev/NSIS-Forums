<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niteflyer</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem with nsExec and the logging of german umlaute into the logwindow. I guess this applies to all non-english versions of windows. Have a look at the screenshot of my XP-System. <br />
<br />
Can I do anything in the script to get a correct output in the logwindow or will this have to be fixed in nsExec.dll by a characterset conversion before the string will be logged ?<br />
<br />
There was a similar issue on<br />

<br />
Can anyone test this with Win9x ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niteflyer</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the script</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Works fine for me with Hebrew. Make sure your language for non-Unicode applications is set right in the Regional and Language Options control panel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niteflyer</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I am very sure that these are the default settings for Germany and I have never touched them. And CMD.exe is able to produce a correct output - as you can see in my last screenshot...<br />
<br />
See the attached screenshot with my 'extended' (?) language settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niteflyer</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is another example, which makes the whole thing even more confusing...<br />
<br />
I have made a small application ExecCMD, which passes the commandline to nsExec. The four tests are echoing a string with an umlaut.<br />
<br />
The echo-command is given at the command prompt and in a batchfile with and without nsExec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niteflyer</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">After changing the Codepage in my batch-editor from ANSI to OEM (DOS), I get another result: it seems that nsExec cannot handle OEM-Chars but logs ANSI-chars instead ?<br />
<br />
The Codepage for CMD.exe is 850 (OEM Multilingual-Latin 1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 21:22</div></div><div class="posttext">nsExec treats the output as ANSI as it does no conversion and doesn't use Unicode enabled functions.<br />
<br />
I tried creating a console application to output text with the OEM codepage, but my console refused to show any type of Hebrew. I also tried creating an application to print out some Hebrew with Unicode but unlike the OEM codepage where the characters came out wrong, it wouldn't even print them this time.<br />
<br />
I don't want to invest anymore time in this right now. You should submit a bug report so it sticks and doesn't fade away in the forum. Maybe someday I or someone else will get to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's rather a cosmetical problem - at least for the german language, because one can guess the meaning of the crippled characters. For other languages it could be worse...<br />
<br />
How about that:<br />

Anyway, I have posted the problem at the bugtracker:<br />
