<br />
i have a rather strange problem i have stumbled across. <br />
<br />
I use VMWares to test my setups and every once in a while i resize them (from Fullscreen to Windows using that button with the two little windows everyone has on their windows) &quot;Exit full screen mode&quot; its called in VMWare. <br />
<br />
If i do that the logo i have defined for MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP shows on the welcome page. <br />
<br />

<br />
Steps to Reproduce<br />
<br />
1. Set VMWare to Full Screen<br />
2. Start Installer, stay on Welcome Page<br />
3. Resize VMWare Windows (Exit full screen mode)<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have that problem? Is there probably an easy fix for this? (Besides not using a Header Image that is ;) )</div></div><hr />

I have seen this under XP and under Windows 7. It is some sort of redraw issue that has been in there for a while. It doesn't happen all the time, but it is annoying.</div></div><hr />
