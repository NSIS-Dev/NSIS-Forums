<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">herdell</div><div class="date">16th January 2011, 02:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, i'm very noob in nsis but i've created some installers with it. See my web page:<br />
http://www.tribodosrenegados.com.br/<br />
<br />
I'm a game translator and all my tranlations installer were made with nsis.<br />
<br />
I need help with page components or whatever (I don't know the name of the thing I want to do).<br />
<br />
I have here a translation with many differents fonts (images in DDS format), and during the installer, I want to put an option to the user choice which font he need to install in the game. I've read a lot of tutorials, but I can't understand the examples.<br />
<br />
This is what I wanna do:<br />
<br />
&quot;Small font&quot; &quot;It will install the small font in the game&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Medium font&quot; &quot;It will install the medium font in the game&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Large font&quot; &quot;It will install the large font in the game&quot;<br />
<br />
The page is like this image:<br />

<br />
One checkbox per font. If the user select the 'small' font, install only it, and skip the others, and etc...<br />
<br />
If anyone can write a working example, I'm sure I can edit it and put in my installer. Like I sayd, I can't understand the tutorials with dummy examples, so, I need a working example with files (can be simple small files, and I change it to my DDS files).<br />
<br />
Sorry for the bad english guys...<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
