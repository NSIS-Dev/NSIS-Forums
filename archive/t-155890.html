<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ellocogato</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created an installer that makes a call to the Palm condmgr.dll's CmGetHotSyncExecPath function.  The installer works properly when run from the hard drive, but if the installer is run from a network drive, the path that I get is an empty string.<br />
<br />
I assume that this is because the system can't find the dll for some reason (I don't know enough about what I'm doing to determine where exactly the problem lies).  I am copying the dll to $INSTDIR before making the call.  Is there something that I can do to make the installer work correctly when run from a network drive?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ellocogato</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I updated to 2.0b4 from CVS, and this problem fixed itself. (The NSIS Update Tool is very handy, by the way.)<br />
<br />
Just to clarify your response, do you mean something like System::Call '$INSTDIR\CondMgr::CmGetHotSyncExecPath(....'?   Does giving a full path like that work?  Also, since it works without $INSTDIR does that mean that System is smart enough to look in $INSTDIR automatically?</div></div><hr />

If it works with $INSTDIR, its always safer to use it unless bransucker can tell us whether is always looks there or only if it's the current directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">It's probably because b4 fixes a SetOutPath bug that caused the current directory not to be set unless the directory was already there.<br />
<br />
As for System.dll searching method, it uses GetModuleHandle and LoadLibrary. GetModuleHandle searches for loaded modules and LoadLibrary searches in the following order:<br />
<br />
 The directory from which the application loaded. <br />
 The current directory. <br />
 The system directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory function to get the path of this directory. <br />
 The 16-bit system directory. There is no function that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched.<br />
Windows Me/98/95:  This directory does not exist.<br />
 The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory function to get the path of this directory. <br />
 The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">That means that it only searches $INSTDIR if it's the current directory. If you have used SetOutPath $INSTDIR before the call then it will work fine.</div></div><hr />

I'm slowly beginning to feel competent with NSIS ;).</div></div><hr />
