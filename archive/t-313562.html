<br />
I need to know whether there is a way to check the originally created date and time of an installer even after I've sent it to someone else. I've compressed the installer setup and mailed it another person and extracted the compressed file on that machine. When I checked the tool tip by moving mouse cursor to that extracted file it doesn't show the originally created date. Instead it shows the extracted date and time. Is there any command to check this originally created date and time or do I have to embed it somehow with installer script?</div></div><hr />
