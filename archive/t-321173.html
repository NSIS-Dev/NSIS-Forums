<br />
I want to includ another nsi file using !include.<br />
<br />
My other nsi file is simply:<br />
<br />
Function &lt;functionname&gt;<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
Which the compiler doesn't like as I get an error on line 1 of the file to be included.  Do I need to use some basic includes or something even if this nsi file will just be included in another nsi file?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">26th July 2010, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, you cannot include a file from inside a function or a section. Put the !include all the way at the top of your script.<br />
Second, maybe the compiler doesn't like empty functions? Try adding a bogus command there, like StrCmp &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; 0 1   or whatever.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Edit: also, next time you're asking about an error, it *might* help if you posted the actual error. You know, so that people on the other end can actually have a clue what you're talking about.)</div></div><hr />

Sure you can. Wherever you put the !include is where the contents of that file will go.<br />
<br />
What is the error that the compiler shows?<br />

Err oops. What I meant to say is &quot;you can't include a header file that defines new functions, from inside a function or section.&quot;</div></div><hr />
