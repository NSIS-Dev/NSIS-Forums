<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mosestycoon</div><div class="date">28th September 2003, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Folks -<br />
<br />
is there a way to integrate some directives in the compiler-script to exclude folders and/or files which are in the potential path the compiler integrates files?<br />
<br />
The reason is that the application I do is  in a CVS. So I don't want to go through the whole structure and delete CVS-directories and included files everytime I actualized the working dir...<br />
<br />
Thx Mo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">29th September 2003, 07:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you can create a batch file that removes the CVS data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mosestycoon</div><div class="date">29th September 2003, 07:58</div></div><div class="posttext">So there isn't one (a solution)?<br />
<br />
It's not the problem to delete the directories and included files, but copying the whole CVS everytime again. <br />
<br />
I have the (application) structure underneath the NSIS-Directory to be able to work with FILE /r &quot;${NSISDIR}\\path\\to\\my\\raw\\applikation...&quot;. So it would be very nice to make CVS/...-dirs &quot;invisible&quot; for the installer. It is anoying to copy the CVS workingdir every time again to ths NSISDIR even for the smallest changes.<br />
<br />
The simple deletion is no problem &quot;Search in Explorer; [CTRL]+[A]; [DEL]&quot;<br />
<br />
Any further ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mosestycoon</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 08:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't there another possibility to exclude directories within the compilerrun? It would't be very comfortable to list everysingle dir but not the ones to be excluded.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't this be an feature worth to be integrated, as possible many others could use it to compile there prog out of CVS?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You can have another program create a list of File commands that will exclude CVS directories. You can call this program using !system and then !include its output. This program can even be a simple installer using FindFirst, FindNext and FindClose.<br />
<br />
This feature request is already in the feature request list and will hopefully be implemented for version 2.1.</div></div><hr />

Thx for your answer! But I think I do it the oldfashioned way and am going to synchronize manually my CVS-repository. The one downloaded and the one without CVS-dirs (to be compiled) until this version 2.1 is released....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">13th October 2003, 01:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Really the biggest question I can think of anyone has any preference for the command line paramters for the program.  I'm thinking of something like,<br />
<br />
DIRECTORY /r &quot;c:\Program Files\*.*&quot; &quot;Folder1\*.exe,Folder2\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
The first parameter would take the folder to look through, the second would be the list of files/folders to ignore delimited by commas.  Wildcards would be allowed for the both the directory to look through of files to install as well as the files/folders to ignore.<br />
<br />
In the example above &quot;Folder1&quot; and &quot;Folder2&quot; would be subdirectories under the main inclusion folder of &quot;c:\program files&quot;.<br />
<br />
There would be an optional command line paramter of &quot;/r&quot; to do a recursive inclusion of files like in the NSIS &quot;File&quot; command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I've run into a nice problem setting up this program.  I can call the program I've made within a script to generate a list of files as follows,<br />
<br />
!system &quot;FolderList.exe $\&quot;c:\Temp\*.*$\&quot;<br />
                        $\&quot;*.exe,*.ico$\&quot;&quot;  <br />
<br />
In this case all the files within the c:\temp folder would be included except for files with the extension exe and ico.<br />
<br />
A text file will be created called &quot;FolderList.txt&quot; containg the file list which I want to include like so<br />
<br />
!include &quot;FolderList.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately by the time this text file is created makensis is already done!  So none of the files actually get included in the final executable.  Is there any way to get the compiler to wait until this text file is created?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It should wait. Is it a normal application? Does ExecWait work if you are calling it from an installer (just to test)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 23:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it's a normal console application and yes ExecWait does seem to work when calling it from an installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, my mistake Joost.  It is working.  I was getting confused because it was taking longer for the file to actually appear within Windows explorer.  So with that in mind here is the first version,<br />
<br />
The program is called FolderList and used within a script as follows,<br />
<br />
!system &quot;FolderList.exe $\&quot;c:\Temp\*.*$\&quot; $\&quot;*.exe,*.ico$\&quot;&quot;<br />
!include &quot;FolderList.exe.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
Note the quotation marks on the call to &quot;!system&quot; I think this is what messed me up the first few time.<br />
<br />
You currently cannot recurse a file structure like you can with the NSIS &quot;File /r&quot; command.  I will be adding this soon.  Breakdown of the paramters are as follows,<br />
<br />
1st paramter - The file/folder of files to include.  Wildcards are <br />
               allowed.<br />
2nd paramter - List of files to exclude from the inclusion list.  <br />
               Wildcards are allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an updated version of FolderList.  You can now use /r to recurse a folder structure.  I have also created two macros which can be used insted of the !system and !include commands.<br />
<br />
!macro FOLDER_LIST INCLUDE_DIR EXCLUDE_FILES<br />
  !system &quot;FolderList.exe $\&quot;${INCLUDE_DIR}$\&quot; $\&quot;${EXCLUDE_FILES}$\&quot;&quot;<br />
  !include &quot;FolderList.exe.txt&quot;<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
!macro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE INCLUDE_DIR EXCLUDE_FILES<br />
  !system &quot;FolderList.exe /r $\&quot;${INCLUDE_DIR} $\&quot; $\&quot;${EXCLUDE_FILES}$\&quot;&quot;<br />
  !include &quot;FolderList.exe.txt&quot;<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
Some example usages are,<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST           &quot;c:\Temp\*.*&quot; &quot;*.exe,*.com&quot;<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;c:\Temp\*.*&quot; &quot;folder1\*.txt,folder2\*.com&quot;<br />
<br />
The first example I have explained in previous posts.  The second example will include all files in c:\Temp and it's subfolders.  It will cut out txt files in c:\Temp\folder1 and com files from c:\Temp\folder2<br />
<br />
FolderList can be used in replace of any &quot;File&quot; script command.<br />
<br />
A note on how files/folders are ignored.  If you choose to recurse a file structure the ignore file list must mirror this structure.<br />
<br />
If for example Temp has sub directories of folder1, folder2, etc. and I want to ignore all exe files in both folder1 and folder2 I have to do the following,<br />
<br />
FolderList.exe /r &quot;c:\Temp\*.*&quot; &quot;folder1\*.exe,folder2\*.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
You cannot ignore all exe files in folder1 and folder2 using one command.  You currently have to specify them as separate ignore filters.<br />
<br />
I am working on a way to get around this now.  Vytautas (or anyone else), if you've got any suggestions I could definitely use them now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly does this program? Does it remove the folders, or does it make them &quot;invisible&quot; for the compiler. If so, where do we have to include the lines you've provided with your examples?<br />
<br />
As in my case there are about 15-20 sections, so I get a little confused. Is it possible to include it within a section, and again if yes, how is it placed? All these sections include this *funky* CVS-dirs with the normal device-files. They should not exist in the compiled application...<br />

<br />
This program makes the the files/folders that you specify invisible to the compiler.  Just take a look at the text file it creates.  It's just a bunch of &quot;File&quot; commands.  You can include the lines I specified anywhere the &quot;File&quot; command is valid because it's doing the same thing.  <br />
<br />
I know the CVS dir's your talking about as I've run into the same problem.  If you have alot of files/folders to include it will be tedious to ignore each &quot;CVS&quot; named folder within all the folders you are including.  This is why I'm working on a way to ignore a file or folder that exists in multiple folders.  I mentioned this in a previous post.<br />
<br />
To ignore a CVS folder just use<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;c:\\YourFolder\\*.*&quot; &quot;CVS\\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
This will ignore the folder c:\YourFolder\CVS and all files/folders within it.</div></div><hr />

That's very bizarre.  What is the error you get?  Subdirectories should not be a problem at all.<br />

<br />
This is true.  The $OUTDIR variable is not modified although this would be the case as well if you were to use the &quot;File&quot; command.  It doesn't modify the $OUTDIR variable.  My program works the same way.  You need to set $OUTDIR before you call my program.  I probably should've mentioned that initally, sorry about that.<br />

I was thinking of doing what you just said however you could do the same thing in a different way.<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;c:\\Temp\\folder1\\*.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously this doesn't include any of the other folders under Temp but it does work.  Provided you don't have a large number of folders in the Temp folder that may work for you.  Just add the other folders separately.  Obviously if it worked the way you're suggesting then all of the other subfolders under &quot;Temp&quot; would work.  So there is a benfit to it.  I'll put it on my list of features to add.<br />
<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;c:\\Temp\\*.*&quot; &quot;folder1\\*.txt&quot;<br />

<br />
The second problem is that if you use a single file command to recurse a directory tree it also recreates the whole tree so that the files in the subfolders on the local machine are placed in the same subdirectories on the target machine.  However you program produces a list of file commands that copy files from their subdirectories into the $OUTDIR set by the installer before the call but it does not recreate the directory tree.  For example:  If you have two directories one containing exe files and another containing help files using your program both the exe and help files would end up in the root directory rather that the 'bin' and 'help' directories.<br />
<br />
As for the last suggestion I was thinking of a case where the whole program directory could be recursed but one of several directories only needed to copy one type of file.  It would make this sort of senario a lot easier to manage.<br />

I gave your latest FolderList a try, but still without success. Ok perhaps I am doing it wrong, so here is what I did:<br />
!macro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE INCLUDE_DIR EXCLUDE_FILES<br />
  !system &quot;FolderList.exe /r $\&quot;${INCLUDE_DIR} $\&quot; $\&quot;${EXCLUDE_FILES}$\&quot;&quot;<br />

!macroend<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;${NSISDIR}\TSW\*.*&quot; &quot;CVS\*.*&quot;<br />
(Still the part I've mentioned above)<br />
<br />
This time, I get another compilererror:<br />
!insertmacro: FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE<br />
!system: &quot;FolderList.exe /r &quot;C:\Programme\NSIS\TSW\*.* &quot; &quot;CVS\*.*&quot;&quot;<br />

It is a little difficult to describe so I will attach directory tree snapshots the dir.txt file contains the source directory and dir1.txt contains the target directory produced by the installer. {NOTE: No files were actually excluded in this script.}<br />
<br />
Because the files in your program are sorted in alphabetical order files in the root directories get placed in subdirectories is they come after a folder in the sorting order.<br />

Sure you could probably do the same thing with those script calls. I'm doing it with the same Win32 calls in C++.  NSIS is definitely nice but I've been using C/C++ alot longer than I've been working with NSIS.  It's what I'm most proficient and comfortable with. That's why I chose it.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you are calling my program outside of a section or function.  As it mentioned from your error you cannot call &quot;Push $OUTDIR&quot; outside a section.  You also cannot make a call to &quot;File&quot; outside of a section or function.  <br />
<br />
Okay, so I have to call it in every section like:<br />
Section &quot;1&quot; sec1<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;${NSISDIR}\Path\to\Section1\Dir\*.*&quot; &quot;CVS\*.*&quot;<br />
...<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;2&quot; Sec2<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;${NSISDIR}\Path\to\Section2\Dir\*.*&quot; &quot;CVS\*.*&quot;<br />
...<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Is that correct rsegal?<br />

Yep, that's right.  You can make both calls in the same section or in separate sections like you've got.<br />

Hmmmm... I was examining it and forgot something: &quot;Compile Time is different than Run Time&quot; if was a code for it, has to be in Run Time (File command is in Run Time). Yeah, now I realize, have to use it with plugins...<br />
<br />
This DLL have an installation? I tried it and I could't use it. Maybe putting only the DLL and the readme in the Zip.<br />
<br />
(Out of subject, I tried to download instdrv.zip from Archive, and give an error saying:<br />
<br />
Error: The file you requested could not be found!)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure you could do it with plugins.  Pugin calls are run at run-time not at compile time.  My program is a standalone executble called using the &quot;!system&quot; command.  See messages posted further back in the discussion for examples of it's use and where to download it.</div></div><hr />

I said about the command &quot;File&quot; here. Inclusion inside program package compiling is not possible. (since will give a error that a variable (example) don't exist, when doing the code)<br />

I tried the program inside the .zip file. Give error about Kernel32.dll, laking a function. I'm using Win95, without latest updates (fear of giving problems, NOW). And it's only a comment, don't worry much about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I've got a new version to try out.  A few notes on its use.  Empty directories are not included when recursing.  If this is an issue for anyone let me know and I will look for solution.  Any files, folders you want to ignore will be ignored in all folders.  So for example<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;C:\\MyFolder\\*.*&quot; &quot;\\CVS\\,&quot;<br />
<br />
will ignore all CVS folders under &quot;c:\MyFolder&quot; and it's subfolders.  Notice in the example you must prefix the folder to ignore with a &quot;\&quot; character.  If you are ignoring a folder a the last item in your ignore list it will require a comma after the prefixed backslash as in the example.  If you do not have a folder as your last ignore item this is not a problem.  <br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;C:\\MyFolder\\*.*&quot; &quot;\\CVS\\,*.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry about the being specific about the backslashes and commas, I will be fixing this eventually.</div></div><hr />

This command did not exclude all of the zip files from the updates directory.!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;C:\Program Files\Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy\*.*&quot; &quot;SDHelper.dll,Updates\*.zip&quot; I'm not sure if its just the wildcards in subdirectories or wildcard full stop that don't work.<br />

<br />
Yeh it's not setup to properly deal with the format &quot;Updates\*.zip&quot; as a parameter right now.  I took that feature out temporarily.  To exclude zip files from the updates subfolder right now you will need to use,<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy\\*.*&quot; &quot;\\Updates\\,SDHelper.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
!insertmacro FOLDER_LIST_RECURSIVE &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy\\Updates\\*.*&quot; &quot;*.zip&quot;<br />
<br />
This will ignore the &quot;Updates&quot; folder on the first call and then it can be included with zip files filtered out in the next call.  The next big thing I'll be looking at is how to distinguish between ignoring a single folder over ignoring all folders in a recursive structure.  Suggestions for a syntax are always welcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried FolderList and it is efficient. Thank you for your job.<br />
<br />
Is it still to be integrated in NSIS for 2.1 version ?<br />
When is 2.1 version planned ?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
