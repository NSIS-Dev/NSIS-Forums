Can anyone explain why this happened and how to solve it?<br />

The user can change the active codepage in the Regional and Language Options control panel in the Advanced tab under Language for non-Unicode programs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dreas</div><div class="date">27th October 2006, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the user:<br />
<br />
My setting for &quot;language for non-unicode programs&quot; is &quot;Russian&quot; and there is no &quot;koi-8&quot; or &quot;windows-1251&quot; in this list. Windows use only 1251 codepage for GUI, KOI-8 usually is used in unix-based OS. I believe, that when installer detect regional setting, it inserts on screen corresponding part of text, and this part in sources placed in wrong<br />
codepage.<br />
<br />
So basically your suggestion does not seem to be the case here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">27th October 2006, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The installer doesn't detect the regional settings. It simply spills its bytes to the ANSI API and assumes the codepage is correct. NSIS is not Unicode enabled.<br />
<br />
That specific page in the image is a custom page and so the strings for it were wrote by you. Did you use the 1251 codepage when you saved the file with those strings? Did the user have anything to to say about the buttons or other pages with translation originating from NSIS translation files?</div></div><hr />
