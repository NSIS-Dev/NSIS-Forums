<br />
just thought i'd let you know how it's going, and how much easier it's gonna be to write simple scripts with slate blue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">29th October 2001, 04:40</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you going to do whenever Justin updates NSIS??? The new coding and stuff like that. What you should try to do is create a NSIS dll that is easily upgradeable. What SB could do is read from it and display it's contents. OR the ini file could work as well. But one question I have is ... how can I help???<br />
<br />
:p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">29th October 2001, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">i am hoping that pjw62 will keep the nsis dll updated, and always keep me with the newest version.  the dll should be easily upgradeable since pjw62 just has to insert the code (i think, correct me if i'm wrong pjw).<br />
<br />
as for help, advertise advertise advertise!  the more people that know about it, the better.<br />
<br />
i plan on having some sort of plugin structure where users can add their own functions to SB, but that will come later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">the dll is upgraded by the ultra difficult task of me downloading the latest source code, extracting the archive (really complicated), bin2h'ing the exe header with hex workshop (to save time) and then running nmake.<br />
The really time consuming part (seriously) is uploading and downloading the files on my 56k connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I uploaded code from the latest nsis to http://www.windridge.junglelink.co.uk/makensis.exe <br />
<br />
I cant be bothered to keep updating it though.. sorry if this puts you in an awkard position. I will probably update it only occasionally. (i.e. when it seems Justin has got a bit happy with it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">How big are these files??? I can upload some of these files in less than 2 seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonzotek</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys!  I saw that slate blue made it into the directory at download.com (CNet downloads).  I submitted a nice review for it, so it gets some popularity rating (hopefully).  I tried to use good grammer/spelling so hopefully CNET won't ignore my submission.  Based on some other comments I've seen, I doubt that would be a problem.<br />
<br />
Just thought you'd like to know :)<br />
<br />
And congrats as well!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I just voted for it. Now, if we get everyone in the forums to vote for it, then you would be set.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liquidmotion</div><div class="date">31st October 2001, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks guys, i appreciate it.  if you could also vote on planetsourcecode.com for it, i would appreciate it even more :)  below it the link:<br />
http://www.planet-source-code.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.28486/lngWId.1/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm<br />
if i get lots of 5/5 votes, then i can win some good development software, which would probly help with slate blue.<br />
<br />
pjw: i understand.  possibly i will only update the  program (dll wise) when justin is done, cause then you will update it (hopefully).<br />
<br />
as for the rest: you guys are the best, support has been terrific!<br />
<br />
thanks again,</div></div><hr />
