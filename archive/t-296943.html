<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaos61</div><div class="date">5th September 2008, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been searching the forums and the help files for 2 days trying to find the answer to what I thought would be a very simple task.<br />
<br />
What I need to do is create a script that will copy a file from an external source(eg on a CD or zip drive) to a pre-determined directory on the hard-drive.<br />
<br />
My problem is that, due to bandwidth limitations, I am not permitted to embed the file into the installer.<br />
<br />
The script is to be distributed as part of a zip file which will contain an empty file structure.  Each office will then do their own downloads and &quot;fill&quot; the empty folders as per instructions issued to them.<br />
<br />
Thinking about it, it would actually be exactly the same process as copying &amp; pasting a &quot;crack&quot; to an illegal software or game download.  (If you're into that sort of thing).<br />
<br />
I have found numerous alleged examples of code that will supposedly do this, but nothing that makes the slightest bit of sense to me.<br />
<br />
Before ppl jump all over me for not searching hard enough, I am mildly autistic and I readily admit that things very often get &quot;lost in the translation&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaos61</div><div class="date">5th September 2008, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx Kichik.<br />
<br />
I was looking in the wrong place.  Could that also be done with vPatch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th September 2008, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">How is vPatch related?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaos61</div><div class="date">7th September 2008, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">In my mind (such as it is! lol) I was trying to apply a update patch.<br />
<br />
As I said in my first post things get lost in translation.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes words have an entirely different meaning for me than they do for everyone else which means it is frighteningly easy to confuse me.<br />
<br />
This makes it extremely difficult for me to learn from books &amp; help files.  Whereas I can learn all there is to know from looking at a working example in just a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Your help is genuinely appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">7th September 2008, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">That's OK, I don't mind. But I still don't quite see what you're asking about. VPatch takes a patch file, the original file and combines the two into a new file. Non of those files are treated any differently than other files and can be extracted with File or CopyFiles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaos61</div><div class="date">8th September 2008, 00:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Aaaaah!  vPatch COMBINES the 2 files.  I thought it REPLACED the file.<br />
No problem .... it just means I really was looking in the wrong place!  I was trying to do it with vPatch.<br />
Just goes to prove &quot;natural stupidity will beat artificial intelligence every time&quot; - lol</div></div><hr />
