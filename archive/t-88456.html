<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justin</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 05:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Just put this together. The main improvement is use of a treeview<br />
instead of a listbox for the sections. This allows subsections in<br />
the tree. Anyway, it's a bit hacked together from code Jeff Doozan gave me, so test it out and let me know what you think.<br />

<br />
BTW, if your first section is visible, you need to set it to RO if you want it to behave like previous installers.<br />

The text and the symbols of the sections is too small.<br />

You should better make it possible to have multilingual setups. :up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1)  Request:  Have a flag for SubSection that will set the SubSection to default to being expanded.<br />
<br />
2)  Bug-ish Behavior:  (Because I don't think it's a bug really, but behavior by design that should be modified, I think)  When you set a Section to have a !define'd var for [section index output], that !define'd var is warned to not exist if it is used before the Section appears in the code, and has a value of 0 and will remain that way until the Section that it's !define'd for is reached.  It would seem logical to me that those !define's be filled immediately and are available in all sections.<br />
<br />
Wow, that was wordy.  I hope it was consise and clear though.<br />

As soon as I find the time and wrap up my current installer project, I'll start playing around with this. In the meantime, excuse me for asking: are there any issues with the 2.0 alpha anyone has found that I might want to watch out for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">2nd June 2002, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the main window for NSIS is getting smaller. At least when it comes to install the same NSIS. I suggest to enable the resize corner.<br />
<br />
Another think ;), the bitmaps for the sections should have the background colorless not white, because some people (like me) chose another color for the background. It's quite unestethic to see the boundaries of the icons.<br />
<br />

I just have discovered that &quot;exemple2.nsi&quot; doesn't compile in NSIS20a0.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">honold</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">it would still increase the space of an installer binary if the function(s) were never called?  beyond that, i still don't see how it could possibly add any notable amount of space, and having 100 lines of functions in every nsi script is a bit of a kludge - especially if non-nsis specialists are going to be looking at the script or doing light modifications.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if you include these functions as basic directives of NSIS it will increase the header size even though you don't use them.

But seeing this new version coming, my little requests would be:<br />
<br />
* resizable windows (n0On3 you are right!)<br />
* ability to generate sections (or section-like selectable packages) runtime<br />
* multi language support, or at least the ablility to change the texts like &quot;extracting&quot;, &quot;skipping&quot;, etc.<br />

Just keep up the good work, Justin!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, luv the treeview !!<br />
<br />
A little mod I've made to my copy of the v2 code is to change the three lines of code that log an error during script compilation (only changed if a define exists) so that they use this format:<br />
<br />
filename(linenumber): error<br />
<br />
This way when I build inside the Developer Studio environment (I make Utility projects for my NSIS installs and use the output window to see errors, I can then double-click them to be taken straight to the file and line where the problem exists).<br />
<br />
This is a really minor change to the code, maybe with a run-time switch to enable it many other people could enjoy this feature. <br />
<br />
Anyway it was just a thought since it's so small ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">0mar</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I'd like to say (as usual) that NSIS is an excellent tool and that I'm grateful to Justin and the contributors that keep improving on this wonderful utility. :)<br />
<br />
I have a concern with the latest release though... I know one of the major objectives with NSIS is small installer size: an excellent ideal. It is my understanding that it is to this end that higher colour icons and checkbox images are not supported - the maximum colour depth was and is, sixteen colours.<br />
<br />
And this is fine for the most part: one can't have everything one wants after all. ;)<br />
<br />
But, in versions of NSIS prior to 2.0a, checkbox images for the various states (selected, deselected) were stored separately in separate .bmp files. This was a *great* advantage because although the palette was limited to 16 colours, at least one could have *different* palettes and hence a different range of colours for the checkbox images.<br />
<br />
With all checkbox images combined into one image (and colour depth still limited to 16 colours) it becomes very difficult to make vibrant and distinct (in terms of colours anyway) checkbox images.<br />
<br />
Here's a screenshot showing checkboxes I've used in the past:<br />
http://www.beyondconvention.net/ohussain/installer1.gif<br />
<br />
And here's a file containing the checkboxes themselves... (always meant to submit these as contributions, guess there's not much point now. ;)</div></div><hr />

It doesn't compile for you? It compiles but doesn't upgrade DLLs? It doesn't upgrade DLLs that are in use? It corrupts the DLLs? It works on W9X but not NT/2K/XP? What specifically is wrong? If you expect any kind of help, you're gonna have to be specific.<br />

P.S. - I've been using the macro for almost 6 monthes without any problems.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that this macro is a good way to do this.<br />
There are better ways, but that requires changes in the code.</div></div><hr />
