<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jamesblast</div><div class="date">8th February 2007, 08:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I want to create a setup that can be started by a normal user and an administrator.<br />
<br />
I figured this out already. So I have to set the RequestExecutionLevel user.<br />
<br />
The problem with that is: if I want to install into the &quot;program files&quot;-dir. The installer says it can't create the files there, even if I run the installer as an admin. I think this is because, windows runs the app in usermode because of the setting above.<br />
<br />
I need to be able to run the setup as user, because there is one option users can select. But the other option could be run as admin.<br />
<br />
How could I get the installer to popup the windows-vista message to ask for permissions in program files dir and NOT directly on execution of the setup file?<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me with that!<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could do it that way. The problem is, that this almost doubles the file-size, because I would have to put all the installfiles into the maininstallert (for users and tmp-dir installation) AND also into the admininstaller (program files-dir installation).<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is another solution?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
