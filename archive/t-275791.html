<br />
I've read some documentation about NSIS.<br />
Tried it to make a simple installer.<br />
<br />
But I'm very new to NSIS and would like you, guys, help to define if (how well) I can use NSIS to achieve following:<br />
<br />
 Install IIS 5, 6, 7 Web Sites and configure directory.<br />
 Modify XML file(s) according to user preferences during installation.<br />
 Detect version of .NET Framework (and prompt to install).<br />
 Install .NET Assemblies to Global Assembly Cache.<br />
 Create MSSQL (2000, 2005) Database.<br />
 Connect to MSSQL Databse and execute scripts.<br />
 Configure MSSQL Database security/Logins for the DB.<br />
<br />
<br />
What plugins are available for .NET (ASP.NET), IIS installation?<br />
<br />
Also what is NSIS &quot;IDE&quot; is most prefered? Workbench seems to be dieing.<br />
<br />
I believe there should be examples of installing web sites, ASP.NET applications and MSSQL Databases. Point me please at some good ones.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks,<br />
Dmitriy.</div></div><hr />

All of the other tasks are things that I've done though.  There's a great plugin for SQL Server that can handle all of the SQL Server stuff, except for installing the engine itself.  Fortunately Microsoft's installer is pretty easy to bundle with NSIS, as is the .NET runtime that it needs.  In my install I found it was more practical to keep the SQL Server install outside of my NSIS install, but on the same media.  That made the installer small and allowed the customer to do a manual install of SQL Server if they needed it for some reason.</div></div><hr />
