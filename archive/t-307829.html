my goal is make a font installer. by this, i want that the 'installer' copy fonts from the folder that it is located to the windows Fonts folder. but it needs to work on any folder, to simplify the work.<br />
<br />
there are some way to this with one .bat file, but with NSIS is looks better, and can be much more customizable.<br />
<br />
and, btw, there is some way to install the font with custom name? if yes, how can I make a prompt to the user to him set the font's name?</div></div><hr />

You need to look at some examples.<br />

the files will be not stored with the installer. the installer will be 'standalone'. it'll be like this: the user has the fonts on its computer, then he download my 'installer' and place it in the same folder of the fonts. he runs the installer and the installer copy the fonts to Windows' Fonts folder, installing it.<br />
<br />
It'll be same thing as copy-paste, but with files outside the installer, and that didn't come with it.</div></div><hr />
