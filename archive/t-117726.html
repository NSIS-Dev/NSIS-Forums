I really hope there are some other full localizations (this would be great to list them).<br />
For all french people of the forum (and any other curious girls&amp;guys), you can download it from www.winampfr.com/nsis ;)<br />
<br />
Cya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with full localized releases is that they always get outdated. It's not possible to use the latest stuff from CVS.<br />
<br />
Also, only a few people need a full localized release, because nearly everyone understands English good enough to find out how to compile a script :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1/ it's not just a translation of the software, the doc is translated too<br />
2/ i have always prefered using a software that's in french than a english program<br />
3/ not at all ! Not all people does understand english ! BTW, if someone thinks he/she doen't speak english so well, he/she will be 'afraid' of using a 'not-in-french' software  because of misunderstanding (i.e the documentation that you've to understand before truly using NSIS) !<br />
4/ the logic is the same as have language files for the UI ! Is the UI can be in french, why not the whole program !<br />
5/ even if the french releases are not updated so much, all releases have been translated (in fact : not all alphas (juste the a6 and a7) ...) ! BTW, i don't really think that downloading each night builds is important :D ;), except for those that are using NSIS very much (and don't have to get the french release :D)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">14th December 2002, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I'm not saying that it's a bad idea :D English is also not my native language :) I'm glad that he spends all this time to make NSIS available for even more people.<br />
<br />
I actually mean that imho it's a better idea not to translate the script commands and makensis output, but to provide translated documentation.<br />
<br />
This way:<br />
<br />
* It will be possible for everyone to use the latest version<br />
* Scripts can be used with all NSIS versions<br />
* People can look up things in the docs of their own language<br />
* veekee doesn't have to spend a lot of time every time we update the stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veekee</div><div class="date">14th December 2002, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">hey, i don't translate the command !<br />
<br />
English script are still ok with the french version ! I just translated the display ;) ! I'm not as mad as it :p ! It makes me think about someone who told me transalting function's name and comments was idiot ! Sure it is :D, and i have never done such a thing ;)<br />
BTW, i have translate the old doc, but as a new one has been released, i have to work hard to upadet it :( !<br />
<br />
Thanks you, glop ! You're a fantastik lawyer :p (hope i would meet you in the french forum if you speak french (or use google for translation) ;) ) !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joost Verburg</div><div class="date">15th December 2002, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">OK :D But do you think people really care about the output? It's a lot of work to edit the source files everytime, and it's not possible to use development versions.</div></div><hr />
