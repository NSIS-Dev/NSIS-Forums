<br />
As far as I know the &quot;File&quot; command will not only put the file I want into the final Installer, but also, when running, it will extract the file to the Output Path specified.<br />
<br />
Do you know if there is a way to separate the two tasks? What i would like to do is to pack for example 6 exe files, one per installer language, into the installer, but when installing I basically only need to extract the one I need based on the OS language.<br />
<br />
I tried ReserveFiles but I reckon this is used for other things and you cannot pick which of the reserved files to extract.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tallmaris</div><div class="date">24th January 2011, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is a solution, but since all the files have basically the same name except for the final 3 letters, I was looking to use something like this:<br />
<br />
File /r &quot;myfile*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
At the top and then pick up just what I need... mostly because I need 2 checks, one for the language and one for the 64 bit. The main idea would be to put all the files into the installer and then do a check for the language and fill one var ($R0 for example), then check the 32 bit and fill another var ($R1) and then call for example:<br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;myfile$R0_$R1.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
If that is not possible then of course the only option would be to duplicate all checks... that's fine (in a way) :/</div></div><hr />

Use the ${Switch} statement. If you don't want to have to repeat the file name then you can use a define or a macro.<br />
