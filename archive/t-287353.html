<br />
I have a NSIS question which is probably due to my lack of understanding of the system. Forgive me if it has been asked before, I tried to search for it but I don't really know what to search for.<br />
<br />
Basically here is the problem: I am writing a .nsi script to install an executable called 'opde.exe' and a config file called 'opde.cfg'. Both files are located in the same directory as the nsi script. So far so good, I was able to do so. But I also want to include in the installer a readme.txt which is not in the same directory as the nsi...its directory can change, but the environment variable %TXT_DIR% always points to it. I tried the following code:<br />
<br />
<br />
var TxtPath<br />
...<br />
...<br />
...<br />
Section &quot;opde (required)&quot;	<br />
<br />
	SectionIn RO<br />
<br />
	SetOutPath $INSTDIR<br />
	File opde.exe<br />
	File opde.cfg<br />
	ReadEnvStr $TxtPath TXT_DIR	<br />
	File $TxtPath\readme.txt<br />
...<br />
...<br />
<br />
But it does not work. At compile time I get &quot;File: &quot;$TxtPath\readme.txt&quot; -&gt; no files found.&quot;. I think this is because &quot;ReadEnvStr&quot; is a run-time command, it reads the environment variable of the target machine (the machine the installer is running on). <br />
<br />
I tried &quot;File %TxtPath%\readme.txt&quot; but it didn't work either.<br />
How can I get the script to read the environment variable of the development machine, at compile time?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">22nd February 2008, 00:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a look at the compile time commands (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter5.html#5.3.1) , in particular you want the syntax for environment variables at compile time (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter5.html#5.3.1).<br />
<br />
File &quot;$%TxtPath%\readme.txt&quot; should work.</div></div><hr />
