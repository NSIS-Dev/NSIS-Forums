<br />
this is my question:<br />
<br />
i have an installer made with NSIS 1.98. it has 3 sections. is there a way to install (silent install) only 2 sections of 3 ?<br />
<br />
PS: i saw that unistall component now supports sections. is there an example ?<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th September 2003, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Silent installers only install selected sections, that is, sections with the SF_SELECTED flag. It works just like normal installers, only you can't show the components page so you have to unselect them yourself using macros from section.nsh or simple scripting.<br />
<br />
Uninstall sections should start with the un. prefix, that's all you need to know. If you want a components page use UnisntPage components or PageEx un.components.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you be more specific on the silent install question ?<br />
<br />
for the uninstall part, you are right. that all i need to know.<br />
but, why doesnt the unistall component take the sections from the install ? i mean if i have 3 section named &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;, in the uninstall i should have the same sections. am i wrong ? or just did not understand what you were saying ? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th September 2003, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Use this in .onInit to unselect a section:<br />
<br />
!include Sections.nsh<br />
!insertmacro UnselectSection ${aSecIDontWantInSiletMode}<br />
<br />
Use IfSilent to jump over this code if you want that section to be unselected only on silent installers.<br />
<br />
Installer and uninstaller sections are completely seperate, their number doesn't have to be the same and they don't have to be related. The last &quot;new stuff.zip&quot; attachment in this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=143458&amp;highlight=pageex) contains an example with more than one uninstaller section.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oops, got confused because of the uninstaller sections question, thought you are using the latest CVS version...<br />
<br />
With 1.98 you'd have to do it the old fashioned way, which is checking if the user passed /S on the command line (use this (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=79)), and if s/he did, skip the section by calling Return (all of this from within the section).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i do not have the script for the software i'm trying to install silent, it's something like &quot;REDIST&quot;...<br />
<br />
i will look later at the script in the arhive. thanks again.</div></div><hr />
