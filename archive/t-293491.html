<br />
I discovered NSIS yesterday and so far i think its fantastic. I've been playing around with it, trying to make an installer for the payroll database program i'm currently working on (in VB 2005 Express). So far, i like what i've done: A modern UI with an welcme screen, licence agreement, an installation directory selection page and the option to install a start menu shortcut.<br />
<br />
This works great, and i've placed files, such as my readme.txt file to be installed and i've got it to uninstall everything.<br />
<br />
The problem though, is i don't know how to get it to actually install my vb program. I've read the posts on this forum and unfortunately can't make heads or tails out of them.<br />
<br />
Could someone explain to me which files from my Vb program i need to install and exactly how i can install them (i.e. where in my .nsi file i must place them.)<br />
<br />
I've attached my .nsi file for you all to look at and i'd welcome any comments and suggestions that i could do to improve the code as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
Laura</div></div><hr />
