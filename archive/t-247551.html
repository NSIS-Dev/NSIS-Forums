<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wolfgangsourdea</div><div class="date">31st May 2006, 23:17</div></div><div class="posttext">In the GetAdministrators function of the NSIS-RunAs dll I implemented, I return an allocated array of widestrings.<br />
With the pointer to that array put in $2, I do the following sequence to get the resulting strings:<br />
<br />
  [count = number of strings]<br />
loop:<br />
  [if count = 0] Goto endloop<br />
  System::Call '*$2(w .r3)'<br />
  [useful code to treat $3]<br />
  System::Free $3<br />
  IntOp $2 $2 + 4<br />
  [count--]<br />
  Goto loop<br />
endloop:<br />
  System::Free $2<br />
<br />
At the first iteration, the code works properly. At the second iteration, the installer program crashes.<br />
When I treat the string as bytechar strings, I don't have that problem. But of course I only get the first character of each so it's not useful but it let me know that the strings are well returned.<br />
<br />
Now, when I invoke wprintf in each of those strings before returning them, the crash does not occur, which looks a bit like voodoo to me.<br />
<br />
Just so you know. The strings are allocated/copied with wcsdup().<br />
<br />
Since I am not used to Win32 programming and I don't know the System plugin's internals, could someone help me with that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">1st June 2006, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">You are freeing the strings and the array using a different method than the method used to allocate them. System::Free uses GlobalFree and wcsdup probably uses malloc. Have another function for your plug-in that frees the array. You should always have the same component both allocate and free the memory unless there's a set method for allocation known by everyone.</div></div><hr />
