<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">secarica</div><div class="date">14th December 2002, 02:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on the &quot;one-section.nsi&quot; example from NSIS20b0, I built the script below.<br />
The problem is that I was expecting that two checkboxes are enabled by default (11 and 21), but in practice only one is active at wakeup. Except for the initialization step, the user selection works as expected.<br />
I cannot imagine what the trouble is. By inverting the two main groups inside the functions, without changing the script syntax, the problem disappears.<br />
<br />
Any clue what is wrong on my part ?<br />
Thank you and apologize for the trouble caused by this relative long post.<br />

Best wishes,<br />

Oh ... seems it's time to change my monitor. The curly bracket graphical details are almost invisible here with the plain text font in its normal size (IE). Until I changed the font size, I didn't understand a thing from your message. It also seems I have to use another font with my usual script editor.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

Ahm, what are the rules here ? Starting from how many lines (approx.) should one consider a script to be included as attachment ?<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />

Well, there are no official form rules, but very long posts make it very hard to read the thread. I usually comment about scripts longer than about 20-30 lines.</div></div><hr />
