<br />
I would like to get the list of the computers located in the network neighbourhood.<br />
Do you know if it is possible to do that with NSIS?</div></div><hr />

It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure it worked (my home PC isn't on a network so it's difficult for me to test)...</div></div><hr />

It works perfectly!</div></div><hr />
