<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">youn75</div><div class="date">8th November 2006, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using last version of NSIS (v2.21|October 20, 2006), normally Vista compatible but I encounter a big problem for putting dlls in a subdirectory of Windir.<br />
Process in NSIS indicates that's OK but there's not files installed on it.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Some lines of my script :<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$WINDIR\WinSxS\x86_Microsoft.Windows.Networking.RtcRes_6595b64144ccf1df_5.2.1002.3_x-ww_88ef1b2a\&quot;<br />
SetShellVarContext &quot;all&quot;<br />
SetOverwrite ifdiff<br />
File &quot;RTCdlls\x86_Microsoft.Windows.Networking.RtcRes_6595b64144ccf1df_5.2.1002.3_x-ww_88ef1b2a\rtcres.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
NSIS process in progress installation I can see that file copy process is &quot;Passed&quot;<br />
I am french and it is written : <br />
&quot;PassÃ© : x86_Microsoft.Windows.Networking.RtcRes_6595b64144ccf1df_5.2...&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this problem known ? <br />
Do you have any solutions ?<br />
May I have to modif something in my script?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<br />
Are you sure it's even replaceable? WinSxS is the directory for side-by-side assemblies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">youn75</div><div class="date">8th November 2006, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I am absolutely sure.<br />
That process run on Windows XP but not on Windows Vista.<br />
I need to install Microsoft RTC API.<br />
There is no dlls of this API installed before running my NSIS setup.<br />
I am not in a replace mode but in real install mode.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th November 2006, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">How come it says it skipped x86_Microsoft.Windows.Networkin... and not rtcres.dll? It should only print the filename. Maybe the filename is wrong somehow?<br />
<br />
Also, once again, are you sure it's even possible to put files there? They may have installed stronger enforcements on that directory. Until now, you couldn't/shouldn't replace those files. Maybe now, you can't even put them without Microsoft's installer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">youn75</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right!<br />
Manually, I can't put any files to this directory.<br />
So, thanks to NSIS Intallation, I couldn't do more than it.<br />
<br />
In progression process of the installation, I think that is printed is wrong.<br />
File is not copied to this folder. <br />
So that is printed must show that is not passed.<br />
<br />
Could you resolve it?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">youn75</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll go back to you after having a right answer from Microsoft Forum for knowing if it is possible or not to write by installation to this folder :<br />
C:\Windows\WinSxS<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer you'd probably get is that you should use their original installer. Execute it in a silent mode. Unattended has a complete page (http://unattended.sourceforge.net/installers.php) describing how to make all sorts of installers silent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">youn75</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not possible with original msi installer to install RTC API files on Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
I have posted on their newsgroup &quot;microsoft.public.win32.programmer.rtc&quot;<br />
a method that one person seem to have done for installing those files on Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
I am expecting their reply on it.<br />
<br />
