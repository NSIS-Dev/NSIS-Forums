<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmar85</div><div class="date">11th November 2009, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
Well i've registered me 2... never thought it gonna to happen ;) <br />
<br />
I have read and looked and searched the web... BUT!... couldn't find the answer...<br />
<br />
I am working now a few months with NSIS.. ( and Eclipse! ) and i must say... love it! <br />
<br />
<br />
But.. i have to post a question.. because i couldn't find the answer.<br />
<br />
I have multiple EXE files... <br />
File1.exe = very much images<br />
File2.exe = something else (like webshop information)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now i must compile every EXE file again, when i &quot;upgrade&quot; it.. and place it online...<br />
<br />
I thought it was the best way.. to use VersionCompare... but.. How does it work?<br />
<br />
Or is it better to make a update program / patch program?<br />
So.. i have in the Tray of windows a very tiny program.. that will check online if there is a new version?<br />
<br />
(I even looked at PHPECLIPSE ) but couldn't find the answer..<br />
<br />
I tried to make a cookie with NSIS.. but even that didn't work out...(then i can check online if cookie exists)<br />
<br />
...anyway... how does it work?<br />
I'm not lazy :) i will do my homework.. but i need help to get further...<br />
<br />
OR i must do something like version control... and look for updates? ( please explain how it works )<br />
<br />
OR i must open the browser with a link, for examples:<br />
domain.com/checkversion.php?version=1.0.0<br />
<br />
Then i can write a php script on my website.. who will select the other updates for me... (PHP is better to write then NSIS ;)  )<br />
<br />
Please help me with a solution...</div></div><hr />
