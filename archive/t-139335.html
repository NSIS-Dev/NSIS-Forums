<br />
I got the following code of NSIS site somewhere (can't recall if it was in the archive or someone's post).  The purpose is to modify the environment path to add a couple of /bin directories to the beginning of the path.  <br />
<br />
	;add to Registry PATH <br />
	Push $R0 <br />
	Push $R1 <br />
	StrCpy $R0 &quot;PATH&quot; <br />
	ReadEnvStr $R1 &quot;$R0&quot; <br />
	MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Current PATH = $R1&quot; <br />
	StrCpy $R1 &quot;$INSTDIR\mars\cygwin\bin;C:\jdk1.3.1_08\bin;$R1&quot; <br />
	System::Call 'Kernel32::SetEnvironmentVariableA(t, t) i(&quot;$R0&quot;, &quot;$R1&quot;).r0' <br />
	ReadEnvStr $R1 &quot;$R0&quot; <br />
	MessageBox MB_OK &quot;Updated PATH = $R1&quot; <br />
	Pop $R1 <br />
	Pop $R0 <br />
<br />
When running the install program, it seems like it is working really well.  The two MessageBoxes show the path before and after, and it looks like it has worked.  I.e., $R1 after the second ReadEnvStr does show the change.  But when the install program has finished and I go to regedit to ensure that all the registry changes are accurate, the path variable is unchanged.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone figure out <br />
1) why it looks like it is working? Is it only making a temporary change that is undone when the install program ends?  <br />
<br />
2) how to make it really work? <br />
<br />

To make them permanent, you have to change the registry (Windows NT). For Windows 9x/ME, you should write to Autoexec.bat<br />
<br />
And searching the Archive is always a good idea: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=91</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually I do search the archive before I post, but failed to this time.  Sorry.<br />
