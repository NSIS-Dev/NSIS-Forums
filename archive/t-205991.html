<br />
I've tried to add a certificate to our setup using the following statement:<br />
<br />
<br />
!packhdr &quot;C:\exehead.tmp&quot; &quot;D:\Certificates\utils\signcode -spc D:\Certificates\xxxxx\www.xxxxx.net.cert -v D:\Certificates\xxxxx\www.xxx.net.pvk -t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll -tr 5 C:\exehead.tmp&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the certificate is added before compressing which means that the certificate is not valid anymore. <br />
<br />
Is there an alternative solution? BTW at wich time is &quot;!system&quot; executed? Before or after compressing?<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />
David</div></div><hr />

It's weird that it matters as the executable itself is not changed, but it does make sense somehow...<br />
<br />
!system is executed immediately as it's parsed so it's executed  before the compressed data is appended.<br />
<br />
You'll have to manually add the certificate later or use a batch file.</div></div><hr />

It could be a ShellExecute that is executed after compressing.</div></div><hr />
