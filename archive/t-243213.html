<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radblue</div><div class="date">11th April 2006, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 products that I have built installers for.  If I install Product A all goes well.  When I got to install product B the default install directory is changed to be the directory where I installed product A.  And the reverse happens if I install B first and then A.<br />
<br />
I am at a loss as to what is going on.  Has anyone else seen this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radblue</div><div class="date">11th April 2006, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">To add to my post, is there some key in the .nsi file that the installer uses to remember, on the installed machine, the previous installed root directory?<br />
<br />
One of our guesses is that some &quot;key&quot; value is the same in both script files so that NSIS thinks that Product B is just an upgrade to product A.<br />
<br />
Does that ring a bell for anyone?</div></div><hr />

The variable PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY was the source of my problem.  My ant task was creating the same value for this variable for both Product A and Product B.  So of course NSIS thought they were just upgrades to each other.</div></div><hr />
