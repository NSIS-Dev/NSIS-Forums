<br />
; LOCALFILE   - Location of the new DLL file (on the compiler system)<br />
 ; DESTFILE    - Location of the DLL file that should be upgraded<br />
 ;               (on the user's system)<br />
 ; TEMPBASEDIR - Directory on the user's system to store a temporary file<br />
 ;               when the system has to be rebooted.<br />
<br />
As I don't understand basically what they mean<br />
<br />
Do I need to change anything, add varibles, or use !define LOCALFILE blah<br />
<br />
and so ???????????????????<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of us have to learn things at some point, and as I don't know anything about programing C+ and so on, this was the easiest option.<br />
<br />
NSIS is a great utility, but with out help how do you know if your doing it right?<br />
<br />
You can rant on about reading the DOCs and looking through the Archives, but it would be nice to have a little feedback once in a while.</div></div><hr />

As explained in the instruction, the file parameter is the location file on your system (the file the compiler will add to your installer). The second one is the location of the DLL to upgrade (usually it's located in $SYSDIR). The third one the folder to store temporary files (this folder will be used when the system has to be rebooted, for Win9x it should be on the same drive as the destionation of the DLL).<br />
<br />
So you will get something like this:<br />
<br />
!insertmacro UpgradeDLL &quot;msvbvm60.dll&quot; &quot;$SYSDIR\msvbvm60.dll &quot;$SYSDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
(when you have stored msvbvm60.dll in the same folder as your script)</div></div><hr />
