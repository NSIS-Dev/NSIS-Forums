How all know, NSIS does not allow to create packages more 2GB. <br />
But it is possible to take advantage of external plug-ins for the organisation of archives. Reading the forum, has found, that there is a plug-in for the organisation of extraction from external 7z archives.<br />
Write please the detailed instruction as of it to take advantage. That, where and as :)<br />
Simply I only start to use NSIS and to me not all is clear.<br />
As a matter of fact it is not obligatory 7z - it is possible and CAB - me without a difference, that the installer occupied the main thing as it is possible places and could be located in a minimum quantity of files...<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
