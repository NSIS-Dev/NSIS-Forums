<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">youngbucks</div><div class="date">6th June 2008, 01:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok ive found a simple script to use to play mp3 files while the installer is going but theres a bit of problems. 1. I cant get this to play the music on its own on the initation of the installer. 2. I need a plugin &amp; script that will let me choose a folder to play music from if it even exists.<br />
<br />
This is the script im currently working with:<br />

I'd rather not install it because I hate it when things decide to start playing music at me.</div></div><hr />

MP3 selection can be done using nsDialogs.</div></div><hr />

ElDodgero: Im making an installer for a new freelanced FPS for my client and when its installing or updating/checking for updates hed like music to play but he doesnt want to have to press play to get it to play background music. Also its easier to put an mp3 into an installer instead of a wav file because if i convert it the size would be huge eg 7mb mp3 = 50mb wav .</div></div><hr />
