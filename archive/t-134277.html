<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">4th May 2003, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using NSISdl to download files between two pages. Since I have a fast internet connection, I never see the NSISdl box appearing, but those that tested the app for me on a 56k modem saw that the NSISdl dialog came up as just a white box.<br />
I assume this is because it appears between two pages, but it isn't because it is appearing after the user clicks next on an IO page and it just moves to the next line where the command to NSISdl is.<br />
<br />
Is there away to fix this without having to use an InstFiles window, and calling NSISdl within a Section?<br />

<br />
Do you need the dialog? Otherwise use NSISdl::download_quiet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">5th May 2003, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm using it to download various files from 60kb's-20mb's<br />
I'll download a larger file and see how it goes.<br />
<br />
And yes, I need the dialog to display - don't want 56k users to think that the program has crashed!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">5th May 2003, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guesing what is causing it; it must be because I'm calling it after the io dialog has shown.<br />
This will be a tough one.<br />
I can't really put it in another page, because I need to be able to go back and forth between points on the same page, so I shall try putting the NSISdl call into a function or something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, what can I do now?<br />
<br />
Should I have an InstFiles page with the pre function set to an IO page, where the user can select the download url, click next and then the log window will appear, or will this not work at all?<br />
I'd like to try this out, but I'm not in my own environment right now :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">InstallOptions doesn't work outside of a custom page function and NSISdl doesn't work outside of sections. You can use multiple instfile pages, enabling/disabling the approriate sections on the pre function or calling the right function from the section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">This is going to be a bit tricky!<br />
The current thing is all in one whole function, allowing me to jump up and down so that it is possible to download one file, goto loop, then download the next and so-on.<br />
<br />
I will get something working. Maybe having an extra ini file for the purpose of transfering information between the two windows, or just saving things in pure variables.<br />
<br />
Do you think NSISdl will ever work outside of the InstFiles page? It seems a shame to have to use the InstFiles page at all (I'd like my program to be custom-page-only):(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it on the To-Do list :)<br />
I will stick with what is possible now, and whenever NSISdl is any-page compatible, then I can impliment it then.<br />
<br />
Grr. I don't feel like doing some nsis now (I want to play some games but my bro is hogging the mother PC)<br />
