to tell the installer to take the<br />
$INSTDIR witch produces / Forward Slashes<br />
and tell it to Create Back slashes instead ?<br />
like have it with a switch or somthing ?<br />
$INSTDIRL or $INSTDIR&lt;/ or somthing like that ?<br />
rename it or somthing ?<br />
<br />
&lt;Directory &quot;C:\Program Files\Example1/www/phpwebsite_en/&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
It's pretty hard to look at this and try 7 other examples from the archive and not have them go through a file and be able to replace text within it on a certin line :(<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure someone has come across this right ?:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">31st January 2004, 23:13</div></div><div class="posttext">StrSlash from this archive page (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/nsisweb.php?page=155&amp;instances=0,11,122) works fine for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">1st February 2004, 03:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use StrReplace, and replace / with \ or vice-versa, too. I think that one converts / to \ and \ to /, so it isn't useful when have / and \ in a string.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">2nd February 2004, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have a handy small example of how this should work ?<br />
I have seen that instring thing in code that i have been trying to use<br />
but have not seen a simple example of it being used anywhere ?<br />
If you could provide a small blah blah working example<br />
that would be nice :):igor: <br />
or mabey a current working script that's very simple using this ?<br />
<br />
What I do notice is that they are never doing it on the <br />
line like i need it :( and many of the scripts never<br />
have the ability to combine the lines as in multiple replace<br />
from line to line or within 25 lines ect.<br />
<br />
now that's somthing we could use :)<br />
<br />
If i could just tag the instreplace on certin lines throught<br />
the file on those specific lines that would be real nice.<br />
<br />
Actually it would be Ten Million times easier to<br />
have a switch or renamed thing to do the / instead of \<br />
<br />
Is there a way i can just add my own funtions and such<br />
and make my own stuff and recompile and release my own version of the installer ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">2nd February 2004, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I gave you an example in my first post. Have you tried it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainmanp7</div><div class="date">2nd February 2004, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at the<br />
StrReplace Exapmple<br />
and saw the C:\ C:\ and thought you were tryig to show me a version of um<br />
replacing the name of the file command i'm dense<br />
but i did try those examples that were on the link<br />
<br />
in this Example i noticed<br />
Push &quot;C:/bla/bla/bla&quot; ;what i notice is a directory change<br />
Push &quot;/&quot; ;Push ? with no other code ?<br />
Call StrSlash ;call the function ? where is the code<br />
Pop $0 ;Pop ?<br />
DetailPrint $0 ; Detail of ?<br />
<br />
I can tell you the scripts i have tried and didn't work :0<br />
if that would help ?<br />
<br />
this is the part that's killing me<br />
Push &quot;&lt;Directory $\&quot;$INSTDIR/www/phpwebsite_en/$\&quot;&gt;&quot; ;replace with <br />
Push 1118 ;line to replace on <br />
Push &quot;$INSTDIR\Apache\conf\httpd.conf&quot; ;file to replace in <br />
Call WriteToFileLine <br />
<br />
If I had a um<br />
Example to fix this and make the \ go / i would be home free I think ?<br />
&lt;Directory &quot;C:\Program Files/PrositeXL/www/phpwebsite_en/&quot;&gt;<br />
