My only quibble isn't with your program, in fact. It's with the complete chaos that the community is facing. Obviously, a great many of us think that a GUI for NSIS would be fantastic. But then, why are we building 30 million versions. Sure, we need choice, and diversity, but don't you think we could build a superior product if we put our collective noggins together?<br />
<br />
If you want diversity (and with the knowledge that not all programmers speak the same language), why don't we have a VB version, a C++ version, and a Delphi version. That way, we build independant versions in small groups, see what works, see what doesn't, then combine the winning solutions into one kickass product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PabUK</div><div class="date">17th April 2001, 13:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I agree with what you are saying. That is why I am not making a GUI. This program is purely designed to be like Notepad for NSIS, with the extra features like compiling. It will associate itself with .nsi files to make our lives easier. A GUI on the other hand offers a completely graphical way with which to create executables without ever touching an .nsi script.<br />
<br />
Good luck to all those working on a GUI. If you need any programming help I am sure you can find some in this forum. I myself work in Visual Basic.</div></div><hr />

   Adding colours to the workpad will be a very good advantage for everybody.  I mean hightlighting the keywords and commands for the script..<br />
<br />
+ Im making a GUI for NSIS in VB., need more hands to work upon it., planning to launch it as a opensource project via SourceForge.net .., I want as many people as possible to lend a helping hand... Look at thread named Intelligent NSIS Script generator (GUI)... for more details...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PabUK</div><div class="date">17th April 2001, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to do colored tags but I cannot find out how to do it. If anyone has some example code (like coloring HTML tags in a RTF control for instance).<br />
<br />
The advantage of not having the colored tags is that I won't have to distribute extra controls with the program.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A GUI is a &quot;Nice Idea&quot; for NSIS to get newbies going, and for advanced users to create skeletons.<br />
<br />
But a text editor is a &quot;wank-ass idea&quot;<br />
<br />
Here is why. There is a bazillion programmers editors that do it better.<br />
<br />
Ultraedit (http://www.ultraedit.com) is my prefered editor. Here (http://www.skinmaster.co.uk/downloads/nsis.txt) is a word file definintion for NSIS scripts for ultraedit. Add it to your wordfile.txt to syntax highlight NSIS Script.<br />
<br />
You can then set up a &quot;tool&quot; in ultraedit to run MakeNSIS on your script. You can set multiple tool definitions for various debug switches if you like.<br />
<br />
Why re-invent the wheel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PabUK</div><div class="date">20th April 2001, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes it is good to reinvent the wheel. For a start, that program is shareware, this one is freeware. However good another program is they still won't be designed with NSIS in mind, which this one is. I already have a very good text editor on my system which is free, and I am not going to install another full-featured one just so I can edit NSIS files, that would be reinstalling the wheel (a new expression). You can use whatever text editing program you like for your NSIS needs but that won't stop me finishing this program for myself and others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s1138</div><div class="date">20th April 2001, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">THEMike</div><div class="date">20th April 2001, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">There are plenty of free apps like Ultraedit, that will do the job better than a new one.<br />
<br />
PFE for one, it's almost as good as ultraedit, but free. I use ultraedit cos I code in it about 10 hours a day so I have to have what I consider to be the best.<br />
<br />
I just set PFE (Programmers File Editor) up for NSIS and found it as good as Ultraedit for NSIS stuff. And, sorry, but better than yours.<br />
<br />
Sure continue to develop it if you want, nothing wrong with that, wouldn't put you down for it, but I would say that if you are good enough to write something good enough for the purpose to stop anyone using UE or PFE, then you might as well use the talent on not reinventing the wheel.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike007</div><div class="date">13th May 2002, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">pabUK, Not to diss you or anything, I have read your posts above but I still don't see why your application will be better than any of the free or shareware versions available.  For example, you say that your program is designed with NSIS in mind.  Great, but what can it do that PFE or UltraEdit can't?  I use UltraEdit, and I get the following:<br />
<br />
Associated with NSI files<br />
Syntax Highlighting<br />
Compile from application (and capture output)<br />
Tool config to add command line switches<br />
<br />
Yes, UltraEdit is shareware, it's not expensive and I bought it because it works well, very well.  PFE can do this as well, and it's free.  Can you give me a compelling reason why your application will be better in any way?  Right now, I don't see any advantage.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested, attached is my UltraEdit wordfile for NSIS.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SQwerl</div><div class="date">13th May 2002, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I am agreeing with some of you here. And while reading, I came up with an idea. If it is good or not, I have no idea.<br />
<br />
The idea of a NSI text editor by itself is a bit plain vanilla. The idea of a GUI to build and edit NSI scripts is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Now lets jump out of NSI scripts, and look at HTML (bear with me here). You can do webpages with text editors, or you can use WYSIWYG editors, such as Dreamweaver, and Frontpage. Now, Dreamweaver, has a feature, where you can change what views you want. Code, Design, Code and Design. <br />
<br />
It would be neat, to have a NSI editor, that did that. GUI + Code views. Just a passing thought that I had. Perhaps you, PabUK, and LiquidMotion could get together. Think he used, VB for SlateBlue.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, good job Pab.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have the VB code for doing that.  simply enter the nsis word list and BAM!<br />
<br />
i have tried to organize an &quot;ultimate&quot; gui.  it had some really good ideas, but ultimately fizzled because of lack of people wanting to help.<br />
<br />
i'm all for writing one as a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Venis uses the wxStyledTextCtrl which is based upon www.scintilla.org's.  If I get off my butt, Venis will soon have drag and drop programming characterists similar to Sybase Power++.  Just drag the item you want in the code, let go in the code where you want it, and a dialog wizard will walk you though the parameters of the function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i tried to organize this when my gui was at its height of development.  it got so far, then no one had interest.<br />
<br />
i am all for doing it again tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AMandato</div><div class="date">21st June 2002, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not see a problem with different versions out there.  Honestly, the other 4 NSIS GUI's I have looked at all have their own approach.<br />
<br />
I think before we can expect developers to pitch in time in developing a NSIS GUI, we need to get a GUI at a level that can rival the commercial Installers out there.  And hey, what is the rush to dominate the install realm? :)</div></div><hr />
