<br />
I have the following problem. An year ago I made an installer that installs company specific tools. It is made with NSIS script. Now I made another installer (again with NSIS) and I need the tools from the installer that I made before. So in my new script I simply extract it to the temp folder and call with (with ExecWait). But it never runs. When the installation is finished and I try to execute it manually, all works fine, but not until my new installer runs. Probably my explanation became complicated, but I simply want to execute NSIS installer from another NSIS installer and this didn't work. Is there any explanation about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">22nd October 2013, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">- Put a messagebox with the execution path before your ExecWait command, to show the exact path NSIS is trying to execute.<br />
- check the return code, or launch a dummy exe with only a messagebox, to see if the execwait command is succesful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TrifonovS</div><div class="date">22nd October 2013, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the problem. In all my scripts in .onInit function I check for running instance of the installer like this:<br />
<br />
System::Call 'kernel32::CreateMutexA(i 0, i 0, t &quot;myMutex&quot;) i .r1 ?e'<br />
Pop $R0<br />
${If} $R0 != 1<br />
  Abort<br />
${EndIf}<br />
<br />
So if another installer is already running, the embedded in it installer simply exits without to make any actions.<br />
Probably I can use a command line parameter to disable this feature when I want to.</div></div><hr />
