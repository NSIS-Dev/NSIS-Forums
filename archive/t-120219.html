<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MDuggan</div><div class="date">5th January 2003, 10:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a newish user (the product is very usefull - thanks!) and I would like to try nsExec.dll.<br />
<br />
I am using nsis V2.0b (which does not include nsexec.dll). I just took the cvs version of this file and put it in the nsis\bin directory. However when I compile any .nsi file after I get the log message: &quot;Processing plugin dlls: &quot;...\NSIS2\bin\*.dll&quot; <br />
a message box pops up saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;makensis.exe has generated errors and will be closed by windows. You will need to create the program. An error log has been created.&quot;<br />
<br />
The NT eventlog entry is attached. I'd appreciate any ideas - am I missing something (or is it a mixed version problem)?</div></div><hr />

I remember beta 0 also includes nxExec. Also, plugins are located in the Plugins directory now.<br />
<br />
Please download the latest development snapshot at http://nsis.sf.net and try again.</div></div><hr />
