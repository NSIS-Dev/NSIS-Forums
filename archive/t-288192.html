<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merlinovich</div><div class="date">9th March 2008, 08:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using the MUI.nsh (Modern User Interface). When using the MUI_PAGE_COMPONENTS the effect I get is that for each Section with no &quot;-&quot; as first letter, I get a selection on/off presented in a list to the user.<br />
<br />
However I have two (possibly more) sections that I would like to be optional so that you only pick one, and that will be reflected in the &quot;Required&quot; size shown as a sum of bytes to install selected sections.<br />
<br />
I gather I could use some dialog in NSIS that presents a radio button with some options, but it would then not be visible at the moment of selecting other on/off sections. So I would like two or more sections to mutually exclude each other, e.g. if you pick A you canÂ´t use B or C, and if picking C you canÂ´t use A or B. That said sections D and E and F can be chosen (or not) normally with a click in the check box in front of them.<br />
<br />
Any help to obtain that would be appreciated. I havenÂ´t found a way to do that when searching the NSIS help or the Forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I now fixed my script as I wanted with this simple tip. :D <br />
<br />
Saved me a lot of headaches, and is a non-intrusive solution too. The only hiccup or objection I can think of about this solution is that the name &quot;one-section.nsi&quot; is not that intuitive for my taste, perhaps &quot;one-section-radio.nsi&quot; or &quot;one-section-of-several.nsi&quot; would be more leading names ... but that is perhaps just the sore loser whining  :cry:</div></div><hr />
