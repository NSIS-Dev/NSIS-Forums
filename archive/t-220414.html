<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jameshcunningha</div><div class="date">1st July 2005, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, again.  Sorry to be annoying, but I'm a lonely intern, and we're more annoying than most people.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to dynamically generate installoptions pages at runtime?  I'd like to read in information from an xml file and create textual pages based on what's read.<br />
<br />
(The procedure for which I'm trying to write an NSIS script involves taking persons through service pack deployment for a large enterprise application.  The end result that I have in mind is a set of screens that go through each step, extracting/copying files/updating stuff automatically as necessary.<br />
<br />
A major piece of functionality that I'd like is the ability to redefine the installer's steps without changing code and recompiling.  To that that end I'd like to have an xml file which the installer could use, at runtime, to dynamically generate pages/execute instructions.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm@nder21</div><div class="date">3rd July 2005, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">or you just include 2 pages, and jump between them.<br />
then on both pages use code in pre and leave functions to load the right ini files.</div></div><hr />
