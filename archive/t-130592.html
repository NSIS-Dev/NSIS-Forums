<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">1st April 2003, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a combox that needs to have a fairly large number of items (i.e. &gt; 100).  Each item is about 10 characters.  I am trying to input the items directly into the ini file however I can't fit all the items on one line.  Even if I could get all the items on one line this wouldn't be all that great to read.  Is there a way so I can specify in the ini file each of the items to be included in the combobox.<br />
<br />
What I want is something like the example below however I tried this and it didn't work.  Is there a special character that can be used to tell NSIS that list is information is continued on the next line?<br />
<br />
[Field 1]<br />
Type=droplist<br />
Text=ListText<br />
Left=70<br />
Right=180<br />
Top=35<br />
Bottom=80<br />
ListItems=List Item A|<br />
List Item B|<br />
List Item C|<br />

Place all of the data for a single control on a single line with elements separated by | characters. There is nothing more you can do to make this easier to read (but then who cares, it's not meant to be read by a person, just by InstallOptions).<br />
<br />
When you say it won't fit on a single line what do you mean? I'm not aware of a line length limit (there probably is one, I'm just trying to get more information about your problem).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsegal</div><div class="date">2nd April 2003, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">It's alright I managed to correct the problem which really isn't a problem after all. The editor I was using to list the items for the combobox had a limit of 2048 characters for a line.  It didn't perform an automatic wordrap like many other editors do for some reason.  After switching to go old Wordpad for editing the INI file everything worked fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help Sunjammer.</div></div><hr />
