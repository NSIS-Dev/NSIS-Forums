We are building a big hotel application using powerbuilder.<br />
Till now our setup application was in Powerbuilder.<br />
We decided to use nsis.I have studied the documentation but i have some basic question that it would be very heplful if u could answer<br />
<br />
1)Our application is approx 350MB devided into folders.The setupexe that will be produced from nsis compiler will include the whole 350MB product or the folder will be in the cd as they are now and the setup.exe will install them?<br />
2)How does nsis 'understand' that the files to be installed are in the same CD as the it is?Is the var ${NSISDIR} do the job?<br />
3)I have 4 applications that I want to be installed.I found it imposible to define 4 seperate InstallDir vars and screens so I tried to have one InstallDir and with Strcpy<br />
      strcpy $1 &quot;$PROGRAMFILES\hotel&quot;<br />
      strcpy $1 &quot;pos&quot;<br />
shouldn t $1 be hotelpos?<br />
4)if I want to have uninstallers for each of the 4 apps I should build the uninstallers within each app's section?<br />
5)I tried to use the nsisedit wizard to build a nsis modernui but althouth the script is produced it cannot be compiled<br />
I get the followinf errors<br />
!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_PAGE_WELCOME&quot; not found!<br />
!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_PAGE_LICENSE&quot; not found!<br />
!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_PAGE_LICENSE&quot; not found!<br />
!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_PAGE_INSTFILES&quot; not found!<br />
!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_PAGE_FINISH&quot; not found!<br />
!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES&quot; not found!<br />
!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES&quot; not found!<br />
<br />
The script produced by nsisedit<br />

Any help welcome<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Depends on what you use. You can use the File instruction to include a file into the installer or CopyFiles to copy it from anywhere you want.<br />
<br />
2) ${NSISDIR} is a constant specifying the directory in which NSIS is installed on your system, not the user's. $EXEDIR is what you're looking for. It's the directory where the installer is located.<br />
<br />
3) StrCpy doesn't append. If you want to append use:<br />
<br />
StrCpy $1 &quot;$1pos&quot;<br />
<br />
In the latest CVS version you can easily define more than one directory selection pages, each one controlling another variable than $INSTDIR.<br />
<br />
4) You can only have one uninstaller per installer. In the latest CVS version you can include a components page in the uninstaller, so you can make it one uninstaller for all of the applications.<br />
<br />
The easiest workaround would be creating 4 different installers.<br />
<br />
5) You are probably using the latest version of HM NIS Edit with an old version of NSIS. Upgrade to the latest CVS version of NSIS. See the development page on the NSIS's homepage for more information on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please attach large scripts next time.</div></div><hr />

!insertmacro: macro named &quot;MUI_PAGECOMMAND_WELCOME&quot; <br />
or you can download the latest version of NSIS (not the release but the snap shot) and then it will work again.</div></div><hr />
