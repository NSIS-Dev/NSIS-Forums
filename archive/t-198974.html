<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scarfy</div><div class="date">11th November 2004, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I went now for days through the forums and documentation and can't find anywhere an explenation where they don't epect u know stuff that i can't find in the documentation.. I just startet with NSIS and I really don't know alot of basics.. And it seems those sings r the hardest to find here..<br />
So i gave up and try now posting here..<br />
<br />
To my problem. I only want a simple thing like changing the background color of the installer. I could do it in the main window but that grey area doesn't really fit to my color.. so how (and not just a snipped of code wich i don't know how to put in) can i change the grey color of it..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th November 2004, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to understand FindWindow and GetDlgItem you need some basic understanding of Windows dialogs and windows. SetCtlColors doesn't require any previous knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scarfy</div><div class="date">12th November 2004, 07:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I played around with those commands but at compiling it always says that the function i made it in is not referenced. I know its embarresing basic question.. but i'll ask it anyway.. How DO you reference it? and where in the code r u suposed to? on each page seperatly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th November 2004, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">For functions to be referenced, they must be called with Call or be a callback function (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.7.2). What you're looking for is page callback functions (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.5.3). Note that the MUI has different way of defining page callback functions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scarfy</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks alot for your help... <br />
<br />
But I don't really get the hang of the callback function. The read the discription to the funktion u linked to like... well alot... and I'm still not sure how to call it.. The only thing im sure of that it involves show. And i can't make the function in use in the example there.. <br />
<br />
And u said the MUI does it diferently anyway? Couldn't find alot in the modern UI Readme... meaby im just looking at the wrong places.. but i can't find the right ones...<br />
<br />
But thanks for all your help so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, MUI does it different...<br />
<br />
!define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_SHOW myWelcomeShowFunc<br />
!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_WELCOME<br />
<br />
Function myWelcomeShowFunc<br />
 ...<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
-Stu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't call callback functions. NSIS calls them. They are functions with special names that NSIS identifies and calls in certain situations.</div></div><hr />
