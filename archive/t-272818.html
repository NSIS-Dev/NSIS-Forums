<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AnswerSeeker</div><div class="date">14th June 2007, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to follow the documentation that comes with NSIS 2.28 to generate an installer in Linux, but am not having much luck...<br />
<br />
First, I installed SCONS v0.96.93 as specified in NSIS documentation.  Then I installed NSIS v.2.28-src and tried to compile a 'makensis' file according to page G3 of the NSIS doc.<br />
<br />
Running the two scons commands NSIS suggests works, but no STUBS folder gets generated so running 'makensis install &lt;nsi_filename&gt;' doesn't work, because no compression is available.  I presume I need to create the makensis file using the standard 'scons install-compiler' command without any exclusions...<br />
<br />
My first questions is, is gcc a valid cross compiler?<br />
If so, when I try running 'makensis install-compiler' I get an error that suggest that the SConstruct file provided by NSIS is improperly formatted...<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a working makensis binary for linux?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

As G3 says, you need to install the newly compiled makensis into a pre-built folder extracted from the ZIP'ed version of NSIS.</div></div><hr />
