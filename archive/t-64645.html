What i would like to use this for is an install that i compiled a while ago and i don't have the .nsi script any more. The script was quite lengthy and i don't have the time anymore to go back a rewrite it. If anyone else has the need for a decompiler please post here. <br />
<br />
thanx for the replies:)</div></div><hr />

I believe that he has an actual program that decompiles it. But you have to ask him. On his web site | http://www.incomplete.co.uk/nsis.htm | he has a file extractor. But no decompiler.<br />
