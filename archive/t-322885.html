<br />
I'm very new to NSIS and I haven't yet grasped the full logic of the script yet. I'm on a project to create an installer for a program and so far I've used the Eclipse plug-in. It's quite neat as it creates a working script for you after just adding a few parameters. There are however a few stuff I need to add myself.<br />
<br />
I need my installer to check to see if the computer has SQL Server 2008 Express installed, and if not, offer to install it. I know how to add installers in my installer, but I have no idea how to find already installed programs.<br />
<br />
Any help on this subject would be much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There may be better ways to obtain the info you need, though. Perhaps someone else knows? Try googling, too.</div></div><hr />

Note that this doesn't mean you -can't- use the registry.<br />
