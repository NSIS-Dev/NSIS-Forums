<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">R3n</div><div class="date">9th June 2010, 05:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking to create some customer installer packages, with various specifications to see which yields the best conversion rate. They're not advanced or complex installations, the files just need to be extracted to the directory, and some other basic functions of an installer. Nothing fancy.<br />
<br />
Customization is minimal, one stub file that will contain a few checkboxes is all that is extra out of the normal default installers such as this one: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/File:NSISScreenshot5.png<br />
<br />
<br />
I need someone who's built an installer or two off NSIS and will provide more details. I seen a similar post, so I hope this is OK.  Must work on ALL Windows! <br />
<br />
If interested, drop a line here or in the PM box with your contact details (Preferably, EMAIL and MSN and any screenshots of installers you've made.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: This is paid work, forgot to mention!</div></div><hr />
