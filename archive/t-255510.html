I'm planning on replacing a multiplatform installshield installer with nsis.  The installshield is aged and no longer works with the latest jdk so I need to change it.  Nsis looks like the perfect candidate and it will be nice to install an open source program with another open source program.  Anyways.. here's the problem.<br />
<br />
I installed the latest nsis at work and was unable to compile scripts.  The message is below.  <br />
<br />
Error: opening stub &quot;D:\Downloads\NSIS\build\release\makensis\Stubs\zlib&quot;<br />
Error initalizing CEXEBuild: error setting default stub<br />
<br />
I installed the latest nsis at home and was able to compile scripts.  <br />
<br />
Both machines are running xp pro with all the service packs.  The office machine has visual c++ 6.0 while the home machine has .net.  Would this have something to do with the error message?   <br />
<br />
I read a threads on here that said something about compiling scons.  There was another about the windows sdk being wrong.  I think the sdk's are different on both machines.  I don't think I can upgrade the sdk on the work machine because of problems with visual c++ 6.  Suggestions?</div></div><hr />
