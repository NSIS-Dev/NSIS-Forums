Im kinda new to NSIS and i was wondering what kind of script i would have to compile if i wanted to install some files, run a file from that temporary directory and delete the temp directory when the excecuted program ends. I'm trying to experiment but cant seem to get it right... also need to know which part of the script to put it in</div></div><hr />

You should check the readme (NSIS.chm) for reference.<br />
<br />
There's Exec, Delete commands for one.<br />
Also $TEMP for the current temp folder...<br />

Besides that, with your usage of File /r, the entire MicroAngelo directory will be copied. This means the executable won't be in $INSTDIR\setup.exe but in $INSTDIR\MicroAngelo v5.59\setup.exe.</div></div><hr />
