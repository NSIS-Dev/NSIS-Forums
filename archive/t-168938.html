I made a program that writes .nsi file and compiles it with command line. The problem is that computers that launch my program don't have nsis, so either they have to install nsis or I only have to put some additional nsis files to temporary directory while compilation, which would be deleted after installation.<br />
I know that computer needs more than only makensis.exe to execute program, but I do not know exactly which files (could someone give me a list of required files?)</div></div><hr />
