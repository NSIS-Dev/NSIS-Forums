<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">l_d_allan</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a fairly elaborate script that you might be able to cut/paste from, which may address some of the issues you ask about.<br />
<br />
It started with testnotify.nsi, and uses .onInit to read registry entries and environment variables. Based on that, it detects previous installations, and decides whether to display a custom page. It reads from and writes to the fields in the .ini file based on registry entries and what the end-user selects. It uses the MUI.<br />
<br />
With some &quot;trial and error&quot; it is able to keep track of $INSTDIR even when the person doing the install goes back and forth between pages.<br />
<br />
If you think that this would apply and might be helpful, I can try to clean it up and make available.</div></div><hr />

I am doing a project, and so I can't use any other tools or things... I only have to know is how the basedir &amp; datadir automatically will register the path if a user select an installation directory.<br />
example.<br />
<br />
basedir=&quot;C:/MySQL/&quot;<br />
datadir=&quot;C:/MySQL/Data/&quot;<br />
<br />
If the end user install the mysql in &quot;Newdir&quot;, it have to change in this:<br />
<br />
basedir=&quot;C:/Newdir&quot;<br />
datadir=&quot;C:/Newdir/Data/&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do somethink that I can get this results?<br />
Thank you<br />
Tulp</div></div><hr />
