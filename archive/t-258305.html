<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 02:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi i am having lots of trouble understanding the few elements i need to use in NSIS, i am newb ofcourse.<br />
I want to check on the connected pocket pc, what version of .net compact framework it has. If it needs .netcf installed, it will grab the appropriate CAB package to install it. I have NETCFv2.ppc.armv4.cab and NETCFv2.ppc.armv4i.cab not sure if these are the appropriate packages.<br />
I am not sure how to use the ppc-registry plugin to search for the version of .netcf installed and then select the right cab.<br />
<br />
And how do I select the right CAB file for my app to install?<br />
Basically, I have my CAB files for the App i wish to install (ARMV4, MIPS and SH3), so i assume i have to find the OS i'm installing to, then select the appropriate package, so similar to what i have to do with .netcf. And I also have been getting the error that my CAB file is not a valid setup file. but this may be because i'm trying to install the wrong cab file.<br />
<br />
I have had quite an extensive look through wiki and examples without much luck.<br />
thanks for any help</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">30th October 2006, 04:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Kickik and zbd, the code is lacking &quot;rapi::&quot; before the function &quot;CeGetSystemInfo&quot;. It should be:<br />
<br />
System::Call &quot;rapi::CeGetSystemInfo(i r0)&quot;<br />
<br />
This should solve it. I also fixed the wiki page relating to this topic.<br />
<br />
EDIT: i'm still not too sure what &quot;i&quot; and &quot;r0&quot; represent.<br />
<br />
The &quot;i&quot; in the line above mentioned indicates that the parameter is a &quot;pointer to memory&quot; to the one allocated right before (general definition for &quot;i&quot; is &quot;integer&quot;, but in this case, the integer is the memory location). The &quot;r0&quot; indicates that the value is the value of the variable &quot;$0&quot; in NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">briforge</div><div class="date">30th October 2006, 21:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I'm also a newb and trying to do almost the exact same thing, find the version of .netcf and update it if necessary. But it seems like so far this thread focused on your 2nd issue of finding the OS on the device and the right CAB for it.<br />
<br />
Here's an excerpt from a link I found on the microsoft.public.pocketpc.developer group, to a document for creating a .msi file.<br />
<br />
<br />
Begin by connecting to the device using CeRapiInitEx.<br />
<br />
Use CeFindAllFiles to search the device's Windows directory for GAC_mscorlib_*.dll. If that is present, some flavor of the .NET Compact Framework is installed on the device.<br />
<br />
Query the device registry and enum the values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETCompactFramework. You should find registry keys which represent the build of NETCF that is present. (e.g. 1.0.2268.00:REG_DWORD:0). This version is created by all .cab installs and is included on all future ROM installs. It was missing from the initial ROM install of the RTM .NET Compact Framework, so if you do not find it, assume the value is 1.0.2268.0.<br />
<br />
At this point you should know whether the .NET Compact Framework is present, and whether you need to deploy your own version to the device. If you also need to deploy the SQL CE files, you can use a similar mechanism of searching the Windows directory for the GAC'd libraries. The SQL install does not post its version to the registry, so the only way to know the build version would be to read the Win32 resources of the .dll. In the sample I have opted to always install the SQL .cabs if they are required. This should be safe, because CE installer will prevent an inadvertent downgrade of the SQL packages on the device. A similar approach could be taken with the .NET Compact Framework as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to get rapi to do this? Or I guess it would be how to get NSIS to get rapi to do thi. I'm just learning what rapi is, what GAC is, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 03:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... the plug-in lacks a function to enumerate the values in the registry key. CeRegEnumValue (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/mobilesdk5/html/mob5lrfcerapiinitex.asp) is the function that does this.<br />
<br />
You could request the feature to be implemented by Instructor in the Registry plug-in thread here in the forums (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=223066) as he usually (if not always) announces new versions in their original threads, or maybe just wait for him here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">what about System::Call &quot;rapi::CeRegEnumValue()&quot;<br />
<br />
i don't know if it even exists<br />
and wouldn't ${PPC-registry::KeyExists} do almost the same thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zbd</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having a few problems (i think) with the detecting processor type.<br />
I'm guessing that the vale $1 changes depending on what processor it is. I've tested on 3 devices, all return a value (4096) that is unknown by the example in the wiki. I'm pretty sure that they are all Intel processors. (Devices: i-Mate PDA-N, Dell Axim X51v, Garmin iQue M5)<br />
<br />
So they all return a value that doesn't match any of the defined processor types. Does anyone know about this?<br />
<br />
and what exactly is this line doing?<br />
<br />
<br />
System::Call &quot;*$0(i, &amp;i2 .r1)&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">1st November 2006, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... The first value is an union, which is a value that is retrieved depending on the type passed. The second part of the union holds another structure, so parameter 1 here should be the structure, and parameter 2 is the &quot;dwPageSize&quot; (page size) which returns exacly 0x1000 = ${MEM_COMMIT}.<br />
<br />
So, you need to create another structure, reference it in the first parameter, call the structure, and get the value of the first parameter of it (&quot;wProcessorArchitecture&quot;):<br />
<br />
System::Alloc 40<br />
Pop $0<br />
System::Alloc 4<br />
Pop $1<br />
System::Call &quot;rapi::CeGetSystemInfo(i r0)&quot;<br />
System::Call &quot;*$0(i r1)&quot;<br />
System::Call &quot;*$1(&amp;i2 .r2, &amp;i2)&quot;<br />
<br />
System::Free $1<br />
System::Free $0<br />
<br />
and $2 is the return value of the &quot;wProcessorArchitecture&quot; in this case. Hopefully this code won't give problems...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">1st November 2006, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no union in SYSTEM_INFO. I can't get the Wiki page to load, but the problem, at least in your code so probably in mine as well, is again the missing &quot;rapi::&quot;. There's no need for dereferencing $0, it's already a pointer directory to the SYSTEM_INFO structure.<br />
<br />
zbd, add &quot;rapi::&quot; before CeGetSystemInfo, just deguix did with CeRapiInit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case the following should line should be fixed.System::Call &quot;*$0(i, &amp;i2 .r1)&quot;The first parameter (&quot;i, &quot;) should be removed.System::Call &quot;*$0(&amp;i2 .r1)&quot;That change should be made to the original code, not deguix's code.</div></div><hr />

Isn't the code aiming for &quot;wProcessorArchitecture&quot;? Wouldn't you need to allocate another structure to get the value for that parameter?<br />

(EDIT: Well, now I see I need to put the line 'System::Call &quot;*$0(i r1)&quot;&quot;' in my code before the function call, because the memory address for this second struct would be an input parameter...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can see for yourself how it works with the following simple C program.SYSTEM_INFORMATION si;<br />
printf(&quot;si @ %d\n&quot;, &amp;si);<br />
