<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pawel</div><div class="date">3rd October 2006, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
I would like to do NSIS installer, that will including two versions of file - user will choose which one of them will be installed. How can I do it?<br />
<br />
For example.<br />
<br />
I have two versions of program. First one is Free version (Free.exe) and second one is Pro version (Pro.exe).<br />
I need to do an installer that will show Custom Page (after License page) with possibility to decide which program user wants to install.<br />
Something like this:<br />
<br />
  RadioButtons on Custom Page:<br />
  <br />
  1. My Program, version Free<br />
  2. My Program, version Pro<br />
  <br />
  If User choose first radiobutton Installer will install 1 program (Free), when he decide to install the second one Installer will install 2 program - Pro version. How to show this file on the next Page - Components List?<br />
After user choose one of them Installer will show another Page, with Components List - Here will be for example Version Free (or Pro) and a few other folders (that user can check and decide to install or not. After this, on another Page user choose a directory to install the files. <br />
<br />
  Is it possible to do that in NSIS? How?<br />
  Please help me with this.<br />
  Thanks in advance.<br />
  Pawel</div></div><hr />

Thanks, but this is not exactly what I want...<br />
In Your example we can install two programs - I want to Install only one of them - and only 1 program must be on the list of components - this program what user choosen. <br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

It would be much simpler to have three installer executables. One for each program and one which launches the corresponding installer (with Exec) depending on the users' selection on an InstallOptions dialog.<br />

Just FYI.</div></div><hr />
