<br />
a few days ago, I posted RegCode, source code to ask for a registration code.<br />
<br />
I found that there is a little mistake in the source code:<br />
after finishing installation the alternative .onVerifyInstDir was triggered again. In the new RegCode, posted in this renewed thread, I solved this problem.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to respond to this post with your opinion about RegCode, maybe there are other possibilities to do this thing or to extend the possibilities of RegCode.<br />
<br />
Good luck, greetz, Hendri.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">2nd January 2002, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">looks nice , <br />
will try this <br />
<br />
but how secure is it ?<br />
<br />
almost any installer is cracked (before)<br />
the release is out<br />
<br />
mostly because of the check<br />
or a crack which changes a bit in the exe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">2nd January 2002, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">well Crish,<br />
<br />
you're completely right...<br />
I already mentioned this in the other thread about RegCode, take a look at:<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=68582<br />
<br />
But this is the best thing to do (i think) with the NSIS installer right now... By the way, every installer gets hacked once in a while and the protection of your program also depends (besides the installer) on the protection of the files that arise from the installer. It might be possible (when not protected properly) that people just copy some files to a CD or to another web-site to offer your program for free...<br />
<br />
So, maybe Justin knows a way of dealing with this, or just to make it a bit harder for hackers :(<br />
<br />
I mean, it might be possible to use PGP or some other algorithm to code the files in an installer... But this should be added to NSIS source... (by the way, PGP is free...)<br />
<br />
Well, everyone, good luck with RegCode, ideas (about protection or RegCoding or...), questions,<br />
please post them here...<br />
<br />
Crish thx for the great response!!!<br />
<br />
Greetz, Hendri.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">3rd January 2002, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I didn't mention, but just to be complete:<br />
<br />
the page numbers used in .onNextPage and .onPrevPage are such that in a one-component installation, the question for RegCode appears just after the license agreement and the alternative .onVerifyInstDir is triggered just after clicking install (of course...:)). You should change these page numbers if you don't have a lisence agreement or more components...<br />
<br />
Good luck, greetz,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">3rd January 2002, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah !<br />
<br />
pgp maybe this will work there is a free version with sources out there <br />
maybe its possible to include this in an installer ???<br />
<br />
justin maybe can include something.<br />
but first he has to do other things i think<br />
<br />
<br />
but at the time its so enough for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">3rd January 2002, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with PGP is that it is key based. Meaning if you want to retrive data, you had to give the developer your key to send you the file. The regcode idea is a good one, but with items like the NSIS browser from pjw, you can bipass that. The only thing is that if you program the original program to look for Registry Keys/INI files with the code.<br />
<br />
Good Idea, but sorry :) <br />

<br />
indeed, PGP cannot be used here properly, but I wanted to trigger some discussion on the best coder for this purpose...<br />
So if anyone knows some free coder utility, please post it and maybe Justin will build it into NSIS 2.0 (or something...)<br />
<br />
About the NSIS browser by PJW (???): Tell me about it, where can I find it?<br />
I know some NSIS extractor:<br />
http://www.incomplete.co.uk/nsis.htm<br />
<br />
but that's only compatible to NSIS 1.5x or older...<br />
<br />
Thx, greetz, Hendri.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">3rd January 2002, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I shouldn't worry about decompiling or whatever.. any one who really wants to crack your program will take SoftICE to it. I dont want to sound patronising, but nearly anything that can be run reliably on a processor can be cracked in some way.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't worry about my decompiler or file extractor.. I stopped being bothered to update it a while ago. I only sent the decompiler to a few beta testers.. it was never released properly because of a few teething problems that required user intervention to recreate recompilable scripts.. and function names are not recreated properly. THey are just &quot;function_%u&quot; etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crish</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 08:42</div></div><div class="posttext">some of the crypting algorithms that pgp uses are completly free and maybe these can be included directly in nsis 2.0 ?<br />
<br />
so then u can use a crypt or encrypt function directly in nsi files <br />
<br />
i 've seen c++ code of such algos in the linux version of pgp<br />
maybe the code (only for crypting) is portable - without the key system<br />
<br />
???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">But encoding would take forever if you are going to compress AND encode an installer that would go over 6MB. It is a good idea in some aspects, but then you have to worry about the US encryption laws and other encryption laws around the world. It is a good idea, but there are many laws that would restrict this.<br />
