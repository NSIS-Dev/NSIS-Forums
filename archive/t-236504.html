<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barney G</div><div class="date">27th January 2006, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using NSIS for years and have never had a problem till now. Recently I added several bitmaps each with a radio button beneath it to select a theme during install, however, after doing this, the installer will go in to an infinite loop as it tries to load the dialog containing these bitmaps and radio buttons. This only happens to some users, not all and unfortunately it doesn't happen to me. I used the Logging version of NSIS (v2.14) to try and diagnose the problem and it fails while trying to write the InstallOptions.dll to disk, here's the log exerpt:<br />
<br />
Call: 767<br />
File: overwriteflag=1, allowskipfilesflag=0, name=&quot;C:\DOCUME~1\bob\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsk20.tmp\InstallOptions.dll&quot;<br />
File: skipped: &quot;C:\DOCUME~1\bob\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsk20.tmp\InstallOptions.dll&quot; (overwriteflag=1)<br />
<br />
after that the log file ends, any ideas ?</div></div><hr />

It's skipped because the DLL is probably already there from a previous page. You should attach the entire script and the entire log so the problem can be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barney G</div><div class="date">29th January 2006, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">well, after a bit of experimenting I resolved the issue by reducing the # of controls on the dialog. Originally I had 30 (1 checkbox, 1 groupbox, 14 bitmaps and 14 radio buttons) so I  made the 14 bitmaps 1 large bitmap, 256 colors so I could use transparency and that resolved the issue. Thanks for your time anyway kichik</div></div><hr />
