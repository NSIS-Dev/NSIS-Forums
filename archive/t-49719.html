<br />
I was caught by the same thing. Not only that, but I tried downloading the file and it didn't work, so I had to wait a couple days for the webmasters to fix that up...<br />
<br />
No idea why it's so out of date...<br />
<br />
...but as long as you go to www.firehose.net/nsis (http://firehose.net/free/nsis/) often, you won't miss out on much!<br />
<br />
I think something about this should be put in the FAQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbareis</div><div class="date">20th May 2001, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the other sites should either be eliminated or changed to just direct a user to the &quot;current&quot; site (if there is a need to a &quot;placeholder&quot; page).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polaughlin</div><div class="date">21st May 2001, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it matter? As long as you know which is updated first (firehose) then there is no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petersa</div><div class="date">21st May 2001, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it really does matter though because most people will find NSIS through Winamp.<br />
<br />
From the Winamp page I went to NSDN and from there chose SuperPiMP.<br />
<br />
I had no idea that there was a Firehose page or anything, and when I clicked the link and got a 404, I wasn't too impressed...and there was no NSIS forum back then either...</div></div><hr />
