       I have used NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator.exe to generate an NSIS script for me, then later on I have made changes myself .  My script is attached<br />
<br />
Currently  I have three problems, would appreciate if any if you can help me resolve them. <br />
<br />
Query 1 :   My uninstaller at last shows me a page to &quot;reboot now&quot; , I do not want this page to appear How do i do that ( by now you know ? how much I understand NSIS :confused:) <br />
 <br />
<br />
Query 2  : <br />
I think this has been asked many time on this forum, I read them but it did not help me.<br />
<br />
I want my uninstaller to remove some files from %Appdata%<br />
<br />
so i wrote following lines <br />
<br />
Delete /REBOOTOK &quot;$APPDATA\${APP_NAME}\${VERSION_SHORT}\PMW.conf&quot;<br />
Delete /REBOOTOK &quot;$APPDATA\${APP_NAME}\${VERSION_SHORT}\PMW.log&quot;<br />
Delete /REBOOTOK &quot;$APPDATA\${APP_NAME}\${VERSION_SHORT}\PMW_Remebered_Priorities.xml&quot;<br />
<br />
but it did not help, files exist even after deleting..<br />
<br />
I then also tried to create dir in %Appdata% that also did not succeed.<br />
I then also tried to copy come file in %app data% that also dint work....<br />
<br />
Query 3: <br />
I want to detect the presence of VC++ runtime on machine, and I know there are plenty of NSIS solution available out there...  but the one that I want that example is not working, you can find it here... <br />
