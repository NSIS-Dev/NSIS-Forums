<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">0mar</div><div class="date">6th February 2002, 04:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone. :)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there's any way to create Add/Remove entries for the current user only?<br />
<br />
You see, if I install an app. for the current user only, I'd like for the Add/Remove entry for the app. to only show up for the user that actually did the install, not *all* users.<br />
<br />
So instead of writing uninstall thusly:<br />
WriteRegStr HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\MyApp&quot; &quot;UninstallString&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\MyAppUninstall.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Could I write:<br />
WriteRegStr HKCU &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\MyApp&quot; &quot;UninstallString&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\MyAppUninstall.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
or something like that instead?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try it out though!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">0mar</div><div class="date">8th February 2002, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much petersa and kichik. :)<br />
<br />
Here's what I have found:<br />
<br />
1. Does NOT work on win98 in a multi user setup (oh well it's NT/2k/XP I was really interested in anyway)<br />
2. DOES work on win2k and winXP (yay! :D)<br />
<br />
I did notice on 2k and XP that 'MyApp' was the only one that had Uninstall info. in HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\<br />
<br />
In fact, The Uninstall key didn't even exist in HKCU until it was added by 'MyApp'... I guess I shouldn't worry about it - it works fine (on win2k and XP) so why should I fret? :p <br />
<br />
I don't know if it'll work on NT though, I don't have any NT boxes lying around... (hint hint ;))</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">0mar</div><div class="date">9th February 2002, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that seems like a safe bet - thanks again. :up:</div></div><hr />
