<br />
We went into some scary stuff (for me) in my last post; time to go even further! This sounds like a very specific question, but actually quite alot of Java programmers might want to know the answer because it's key to the process of installing a Java application as a service.<br />
<br />
What I want to be able to do is in the installer edit the Local Security Policy so that a designated user (selected during the install) can log on as a service.<br />
<br />
This means I need to be able to:<br />
o Check for Admin rights.<br />
`- If necessary log the person in temporarily as admin.<br />
o List all users able to log into the system.<br />
o Have the person running the install choose a user to logon as a service.<br />
o Update the Security Settings and the current Windows environment (hopefully without precipitating a reboot!) so that the changes are applied and active.<br />
<br />
OK, tall order I know; I'll be working on this today and in the future so no rush, but...<br />
<br />
...any ideas? :)<br />

<br />
Also (to complicate things) I need to only view users within the &quot;docu&quot; group as possibilities for logging in as a service, and I want to be able to add users to that group - possible?</div></div><hr />
