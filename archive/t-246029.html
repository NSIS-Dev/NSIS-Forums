<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bambou51</div><div class="date">12th May 2006, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I am creating an NSIS setup to act like our previous installshield setup.<br />
Everything is fine except for a driver installation.<br />
I just have a driver to install (using setup.exe)<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$EXEDIR\DRIVERS\&quot;<br />
ClearErrors<br />
ExecWait '&quot;SETUP.EXE&quot;' $0<br />
IfErrors 0 +2<br />
  MessageBox MB_Ok &quot;Error during Driver installation: $0&quot;<br />
...<br />
<br />
It is working fine, but on the next use of the driver (if I go back to the previous step of my setup for example), I got the f?*%ing blue screen of windows because of a file of my driver.<br />
Problem is, that doing the exact same thing with installshield or by hand everything is working fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">13th May 2006, 01:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Or some other thoughts:<br />
Perhaps the intial 'setup.exe' could be launching another EXE to do some additional work.  In this case, setup.exe could be closing before the actual 'install' is finished.<br />
<br />
Try running the original InstallShield install while you are viewing the Windows processes to see if you find another process might be launching during the install.<br />
<br />
Or:<br />
SETUP.EXE might not be returning errors unless the EXE itself crashes.  Unfortunately, there's probably no easy way to tell if this is happening. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bambou51</div><div class="date">15th May 2006, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I just restart my script, and wait like 2 minutes between the installation of the driver and the next step and I still have the Blue screen...<br />
This driver is installing a .sys file in windows system folder, and I need to call this file later on during the setup. Any suggestions ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bambou51</div><div class="date">15th May 2006, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I also try to start my setup a first time in order to install the driver, than I abort the installation, restart the setup, and everything works fine.<br />
So I must have a problem with NSIS not releasing dll or something similar.<br />
Even when using:<br />
<br />
SetPluginUnload alwaysoff<br />
SetOutPath $EXEDIR<br />
System::Call ...<br />
<br />
; unload dll<br />
SetPluginUnload manual <br />
; do nothing (but let the installer unload the System dll) <br />
System::Free 0</div></div><hr />
