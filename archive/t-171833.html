<br />
I just create Dialogs.dll. A plugin for call the Open and Folder browse dialogs.<br />
<br />
Test it. Please post your opinions.<br />
Thanks ;)<br />
<br />
PS: See the readme file for details!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 02:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, basically it works, but how about adding more options, like to add support to appear the &quot;Save File&quot; dialog for example...<br />
<br />
But I'll continue to try the System way, I'm planning to make a new header file using all the codes with System plugin... Now, about the Open dialog for my program, I'll use your plugin. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Your DLL size is too small I think you just used 2 API for dialogs, am I right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I use like 10 APIs, but mostly...yeah... for those two.<br />
I could add the &quot;Save&quot; dialog.... ;) is not hard...<br />
<br />
*Add it in the TODO list.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Updated to versions 1.1:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Done it!<br />
Now you can add you custom filter as many you want. :D<br />
Updated to version 1.2:<br />
<br />
 Change syntax.<br />
 Added the custom Index filter. <br />
 Added the multiple filter for both Open and Save Dialogs. <br />
 Added &quot;Create Folfer&quot; button on Folder Dialog.<br />
 Remove the current selection folder label in Folder Browse (maybe I'll put it back).<br />
<br />
Please see the readme file for the updated syntax.<br />
Comments, please!!! Specially from users with Win95/Win98/NT<br />
<br />

I have used your dll for folder with success. It help me to remove the Page Directory that can not be executed inside the sections. Now my installation is more user friendly.<br />
<br />
A feature request :<br />
Could you had the possibility to select a disk only after selection of a file or a folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">And know...<br />
You can get it from the Web Archive (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=454). :cool:<br />
Thanks to all the members that test the plugin. Thanks :)<br />
<br />
@benchetrit: I didn't quite understand. Do you want to select a Drive unit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benchetrit</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, I want the user will be able to select a drive unit only. Moreover, if you could had some filters or exclusion list, it will be great. For instance, exclude a list like &quot;C,D&quot;. Filters to exclude or include like : exclude &quot;cdrom,networkdrive&quot; or include &quot;localdisk,removabledisk,floppy&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, now I understand... However I think that will be adding another dialog, I have in mind &quot;Drive Dialog&quot;.<br />
And yeah, maybe some filters too, although I don't know how do that, yet :igor:.<br />
<br />
I'll work in that tonight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benchetrit</div><div class="date">9th March 2004, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">@lobo lunar<br />
<br />
If you continue in that direction, I will appreciate to have a string dialog for asking the user for a string, and a selection list for asking a user to select a (and why not multiple) value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">9th March 2004, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi benchetrit!<br />
<br />
I try the Drive list, and there's isn't like a special dialog for units. There's an API for detect the phisical installed drives, but It can be done using system plugin. The code for this is simple, or I can point you in the right direction (and API).<br />
<br />
Now, I can make the &quot;asking&quot; string dialog but, whay kind of values the users will select? Maybe some example of it will be handy...<br />
<br />
TODO:<br />
I will make a dialog-style like those InputBoxes that come with Visual Basic. This will be handy if you'd like to password protect your installer without the INI thing. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck to me! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benchetrit</div><div class="date">9th March 2004, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">When I tell string dialog I mean input text.<br />
<br />
I have a question concerning Open. Is it possible to select the list of the files to display in the file selector. For instance, if I put *.txt, *.txt will be in the file name  input, and only *.txt file and obviously folders of the initial folder wil be displayed for selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">9th March 2004, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, do you mean multiple selection files?<br />
Is possible! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I try a simple code snipet and NSIS doesn't give more features in looping and string manipulation. I should try another way to make NSIS outputing the multiple selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 00:51</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a little thing called &quot;Callback Function&quot;, it loops everytime when a result is returned, but to return to the original function, you have to end pushing something to stack to the original function know you want to continue...<br />
<br />
Have some examples like &quot;Detect Drives&quot; Archive page (see my signature) of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 02:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...that little thing is the easy part, dude ;)<br />
The plugin have the callback function for the user selected outputvar.<br />
That's not important, the important is get out the files since all are store in one var. Is not the &quot;loop&quot;, is the handle for each file. I need separator, is not a typical &quot;String function&quot; or &quot;Callback function&quot;, a separator to get path of the file in some place.<br />
Nsis, as my begin question here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=171638) is very limited. :(<br />
Yes, there some ways to get that! I just need time. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 03:05</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understood right:<br />
<br />
the important is get out the files since all are store in one var.<br />
<br />
Has a function called &quot;StrTok&quot; inside &quot;StrFunc.nsh&quot; in the include directory, it returns the string you want to be returned from a complex string. Like &quot;Text&quot; from string &quot;Number|Variable|Text|GUID&quot;. It is not included on Archive (that is my AdvStrTok).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not want multiple selection for files, I just wants that the dialog Open only displays the files that respect a string for instance *.nsi, like the standard Open File dialog do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you should say &quot;Files Filter&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Yeah! Filtering....<br />
<br />
Dialogs::Open $HWNDPARENT &quot;Nsis Files (*.nsi)|*.nsi|&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;Choose a file from the list&quot; &quot;$EXEDIR&quot; .r0<br />
<br />
Like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benchetrit</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes like this.<br />
<br />
If fact I am sorry I have made a mistake, I did not understood your examples. Now it works.<br />
<br />
Bad code :<br />
  Dialogs::Open $HWNDPARENT &quot;SYD Licence (*.syd)|&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;Select Licence File&quot; &quot;t:\&quot; .r0<br />
<br />
Right code :<br />
  Dialogs::Open $HWNDPARENT &quot;SYD Licence (*.syd)|*.syd|&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;Select Licence File&quot; &quot;t:\&quot; .r0<br />
<br />
Thank you. And tell me when I could have a dialog for asking a string to the user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to change the source code, or you can use the filter telling the user wich one he/she have to use (see Save parameters).<br />
<br />
This setUp will launch from another .EXE living on a CD-Rom<br />
and the file that I will want to save lives on the CD-Rom as well. Can I use this to perform this task ?<br />
<br />
Since the Installer (EXE) and file (to run) is in the same folder, you can use $EXEDIR with Exec functions from NSIS to execute the file.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">10th April 2005, 06:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I had finally come across a situation where I needed an InputBox and found your plugin.  EVERYTHING WORKS GREAT!<br />
<br />
But just in case you get &quot;bored&quot;, I though  I'd throw a few suggestions your way.  ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
1.  It would be nice to be able to specify a default button on the InputBox to allow the user to simply press &quot;ENTER&quot; and have it accept the answers.<br />
<br />
2.  Another nice option would be limit to the number of characters the user would be allowed to type.  <br />
<br />
I know that I could use a StrLen operation AFTER the InputBox is closed, but I was thinking perhaps the InputBox could me made to just not accept any more characters after x number that you specified. This would then eliminate the need for the extra error checks in the NSIS code.  (Of course, it would then be up to the NSIS developer to explain this to the user in the InputBox text promt.)<br />
<br />
3.  (perhaps more of a challenge)  the open/save dialogs have the standard shortcuts for &quot;history&quot; &quot;my Documents&quot;, etc.  Is there any way to change this and allow a user to specify his/her own icon and folder?  I know you're probalby using a standard Windows control which may not have this ability, but I'd thought I'd throw it out there anyway for you to ponder.  (I've always thought this might be a useful feature in other applications as well...)<br />
<br />
Keep up the great work! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya, just come across this excellent plugin.<br />
<br />
I am trying to recreate the behaviour of the built-in file select control (a text box and a browse button) with this plugin, so I can have a custom dialog, and thought I could use this.<br />
<br />
2 questions:<br />
1) The save dialog takes a variable (e.g. ${VAR_5}) to be used as an output. Do I need to push this before I call and pop it twice (once to get the data, the other to restore the stack) to make my function &quot;clean&quot; in terms of stack management?<br />
<br />
2) Can I suppress the automatic messagebox which asks if I want to replace the file? I check this later, on page exit, as this catches filename clashes if the user enters the file in the textbox themselves, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joel</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there:<br />
<br />
1) No, you don't.<br />
<br />
2) No, is a flag that it might come handy if the file is already there. But If you want to overwrite w/o warnings try FileOpen from nsis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just want to ask you about the adding the possibility of the Dialogs::save control, to be able to give a proposed file name in the File Name textbox? This is very good, because the users sometimes do not know which file name to use for the program, and they can mix the things up.<br />
<br />
Or you can post your source code of the control here, so we can try to enhcance it ?<br />

Forgive me is this is answered elsewhere in the forum.  I have been using NSIS for a few years now and have a regularly used installer that implements your Dialogs.dll.  It has had over 4k installs without an NSIS related problem until yesterday.  A user tried to install on a WinXP box with admin privileges and got the message: <br />
<br />
Could not load: C:\DOKUME~1\&lt;...snip...&gt;\Dialogs.dll<br />
No folder was selected by the user.<br />

Do you have any suggestions?<br />

    quit<br />
  Ok:<br />
    DetailPrint &quot;User selected working folder: $1&quot;<br />
    goto Exit<br />
  Exit:<br />
===================================================<br />
<br />
The user is using WinXP Pro SP2.  Also, the same installer worked on one of his machines (personal) but not the other (work).  He says he has the same permissions on both.<br />
<br />
The installer was build with NSIS version 2.21<br />
The Dialogs.dll is dated 7/13/06<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Ask him to open Windows Explorer and put %TEMP% in the path and hit enter (or enter &quot;explorer %TEMP%&quot; in start&gt;run. If he does this while the installer is running, he should find a nsXXX.tmp folder in there. If it's not there, then I'd assume his temp folder is missing some permissions.<br />

Thank you for your suggestion.  I asked the user to monitor %TEMP% while the installer was running.  He reported seeing a nsXXX.tmp folder as well as a file.  I also asked him to check the space available and there were 50 GB free. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Did you use InitPluginsDir on you &quot;.onInit&quot; function? The error &quot;couldn't load&quot; is because nsis wasn't enable to load the plugin. Something is wrong there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">22nd February 2007, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The next step would be for him to open the nsXXX.tmp folder after the dialogs.dll plugin should have been executed (i.e. when the error is displayed) to see if the plugin is in there.<br />

<br />
I have tested on multiple WinXP Pro SP2 systems like the userâ€™s.  Of the many installs to date, probably the majority of them have been on WinXP.  The user tested the installer successfully on his home machine with the same OS, so I do not think it an OS specific problem.<br />
<br />
I just emailed the user to check for the dialogs.dll in the %TEMP% folder.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

As I said, something is wrong there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jbaylor</div><div class="date">26th February 2007, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated to the latest release of NSIS and added exception handling around the call to Dialogs.dll.  If there is an error I default the directory value to $DOCUMENTS (I am looking for a working directory for the application).  This enabled the user to install.<br />
<br />
I apologize for adding the exception handling and not testing the latest release for the error by itself.  I did not want the user to loose patience.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all of your suggestions and help.<br />
