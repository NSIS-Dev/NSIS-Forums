<br />
i have tryed NSIS 2.0a7, and i get an error from 'makensisw.exe':<br />
<br />
i use the explorer with right mouse-click on a '*.nsi' file and select ...compile...<br />
The error come with each script!<br />
After 'makensis.exe'/'makensisw.exe' compiles the script complete, the result see i in the window, windows says me<br />
&quot;... makensisw.exe must be stop....&quot; (Sorry, but i don't know the right translatation) (the dialog box with 2 buttons &quot;debug&quot;<br />
and &quot;exit&quot;.<br />
<br />
When i say &quot;exit&quot;, the installer is created succesfully!<br />
<br />
<br />
About my system/computer:<br />
--------------------------<br />
-Windows XP<br />
-NSIS 1.98 in the dir &quot;C:\Prg....\NSIS&quot; (installed first)<br />
-NSIS 2.0a7 in the dir &quot;C:\Prg...\NSIS_20a7&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

He will release a new MakeNSISw NSIS 2.0a8. In the mean while you can use the older MakeNSISw, or from DOS (yuk =/). I am sorry for the inconvenience.<br />

You are most welcome :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyz</div><div class="date">30th August 2002, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the same for me...<br />
But MakeNSISw works once then it crashes on the following compiling operations...<br />
I have only NSIS 2.0a7 (08/28/02) installed and use Win 98 SE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">30th August 2002, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try to post a new version tomorrow (Saturday), so it will fix these crashes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE VERY FAST SUPPORT!<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;Thank you for the great NSIS2.0, i really use/need it (at my &gt;job...), because i need a good/easy multi-language support...!<br />

<br />
I tryed InstallShield, he don't can create 'one file installers' and you must study the docu a long time, and the result (the installer) is bader as with NSIS!<br />
<br />
With NSIS you can learn the basic's in some hours!<br />
<br />
Because of that, i think NSIS is very good (and it have future)!<br />
And i started (private) to develop an IDE/Editor for NSIS (NÂ²E)!<br />
<br />
DON'T STOP WITH THE DEVELOPING OF NSIS 2.0...!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daab</div><div class="date">31st August 2002, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi y'all,<br />
This thread seems to combine both of my points...<br />
<br />
First, a bug / usage mistake:<br />
<br />
1. Installed NSIS 2a7<br />
2. Copied &quot;makensis.exe&quot; and the &quot;plugins&quot; directory elsewhere<br />
3. Tried to compile a script from the command-line, by running the &quot;makensis.exe&quot; that is outside $NSISDIR<br />
4. Got an access violation after the compiler wrote:<br />
Processing plugin dlls: &quot;C:\&lt;...the new directory...&gt;\plugins\*.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
* the DLLs I'm using in the script are naturally all in the plugins dir<br />
* I tried both using and not using the &quot;PluginDir&quot; command - same results<br />
* If it's any help, I used only absolute paths, with no whitespaces<br />
* When I run the makensis.exe in the original installation path the compilation works<br />
<br />
Is there some silly newbie mistake I'm not aware of?<br />
<br />
Now secondly, I've been wanting to express my sincere and complete gratidue to all of the NSIS developers and contributors. I usually don't like to write in public forums &quot;fluff&quot; that doesn't serve a specific purpose, but NSIS is simply a remarkable piece of software:<br />
* Functionality that equals any other related product<br />
* Learning curve easier in comparison to any other commercial product<br />
* Good reliability across many platorms (95 to XP) - again something that most of the professional installation makers cannot guarantee<br />
* Great customization capabitilies (and keeps getting better)<br />
* Continuous and useful support from the user community<br />
* Absolutely free for absolutely any purpose<br />
<br />
Great work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">31st August 2002, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I have committed another version of makensisw to the CVS.<br />
If it does not solve these bugs, it will at least faster than before. It doesn't copy the entire buffer and appends to it.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainwater</div><div class="date">31st August 2002, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, you can download the makensisw.exe here (http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/nsis2k/NSIS/makensisw.exe?rev=HEADcontent-type=application/octet-stream) .  Just replace this with your current makensisw.exe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">31st August 2002, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Daab, have you added your own new plugins?<br />
If so, are any of them compressed using UPX or some other PE compressor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">1st September 2002, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Daab, I had the same crash, and I think I've found the bug.  It now works here and I've checked in the changed source file, but you'll have to wait until kichik compiles up and uploads a new version of makensis (mine always seem to turn out larger for some reason...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">1st September 2002, 05:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, funny bug :D<br />
CVS now has the compiled version with Dave's fix in it.<br />
Thanks Dave.</div></div><hr />
