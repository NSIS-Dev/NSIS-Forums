<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oldfriend</div><div class="date">1st March 2013, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually this is a question.<br />
<br />
After the pressing &quot;Install &gt;&quot; on the Components page I need to hide installer completely like in the silent mode (there is the only page there - Install). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, using  &quot;Hidewindow&quot; Components page is shown for the part of second and this is not good. tried different combinations of &quot;Hidewindow&quot; in the MUI custom page PRE SHOW of Install page and and LEAVE of the Components but with no luck as well as &quot;ShowWindow $HWNDPARENT 0&quot;<br />
<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />

Does it mean my purpose is impossible by means of NSIS measures only?</div></div><hr />

This installer is part of another one. Main one (web based) shows own license page and other information and runs this installer, but actually 2 pages: selecting installation directory and components. everything else should be hidden (including installation page).</div></div><hr />
