<br />
I was wondering how do you know if you should register<br />
a DLL?   <br />
<br />
Should you always register an<br />
executable program that you've created?<br />
<br />
I'm really struggling trying to get a program to <br />
install that I've created with Visual C/C++ express.<br />
Dependancies and all.  I've found some of the DLL's <br />
but don't know whether or not I should register them<br />
or not.  Keep getting a configuration error when the<br />
program tries to startup.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Mike</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onad</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">You only need to register DLLs that need registering, e.g. an IE plugin or ActiveX control. A regular DLL does not need any registering it only needs to be installed in directory where the main application resides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was looking thru the post when I found a program<br />
that displays the modules or dll's used in a process.<br />
<br />
One of the dll dependancies I need was in <br />
C:\WINDOWS\Win6x6\...(very longname with many hex numbers)...\(dll's).<br />
When I install my program on another PC it can't <br />
seem to find this dll.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me whether or not these are registered<br />
dll's?  Or what this &quot;Win6x6&quot; directory is?  <br />
<br />
I haven't had a chance to investigate whether or not<br />
the dll in question is on the new PC or not.  I'm assuming<br />
NOT since my executable can't find it.  It could be that<br />
these dll's were installed by MS Express or the MS Lib's.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Mike</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to move your exe to another machine, it'll need the visual C runtimes.  Do a search for 'visual c redist' and that should have some helpful information.  Also, make sure it's the release, not the debug build of your software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">albie</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I will give the redist a try.  I think <br />
this is the answer to my problems.<br />
<br />
So a big thanks to you!<br />
<br />
