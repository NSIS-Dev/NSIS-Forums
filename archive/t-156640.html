I have already got a lot of help from u guys...<br />
I have a question.<br />
In the end of a section I use nsexec to run minimized 4 .bat files that create and format sqlserver databases.It takes a lot of time the operation to be completed so I want to ask u if there is a way to display a custom message above the progress bar to inform the user that e.g &quot;database 1 is being created&quot;,&quot;database is being formatted&quot; etc etc<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance (sorry for my poor English)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">18th November 2003, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">also there is a modified version of nsExec (need to search back a few pages) that shows a spinning text star whilst nsExec is working<br />
i.e.<br />
  /  -&gt;  -  -&gt;  \  -&gt;  |  -&gt;  / etc.<br />
<br />
it should work fine for your needs (i really should look at finishing the code for a few other parts ;) )<br />

I found some nsexec mods but none of them had any such feature listed...<br />
It would be very helpful if u could  give a link (if it is not a problem)</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you can wait a few days i'll put up the lastest version of the code which fixes a few display issues with that release ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyjamarama</div><div class="date">19th November 2003, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">thanx a lot DrO.<br />
how do I define the character that is going to spin?<br />
Can u post an actual nsexec syntax example? (and maybe include it in the test.nsi when u put it in the official contrib folder)<br />
<br />
Also does anyone know how I can change the cursor indicator from arrow to hourglass?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
just use it as you would normally use nsExec. best thing is to alter the dll name so you still have the original version e.g. nsexecmod.dll.<br />
<br />
then you would use it as nsexecmod:ExecToLog ... (check the nsExec example on how to use it - haven't looked at it for a while so i'm not too sure on the syntax)<br />
<br />
with the cursor thing i think you need to use the system plugin and you will want to use the SetCursor (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Resources/Cursors/CursorReference/CursorFunctions/SetCursor.asp) function in it (someone else may be able to help you better on that).<br />
<br />
[ may make sense to add that into the modified nsexec to do the cursor thing automatically as an option ;) ]<br />
<br />
(will have to work on this tonight while i remember)<br />

<br />
Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">22nd November 2003, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">here's a later version of the modified dll (have had to disable a few parts quickly on the way out the door so it's usable).<br />
<br />
there's a few additions to the readme file on usage of the modifications. will have a finalised version in a week or so (i hope ;) to handle a few extra bits i've been working on with it)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">n0On3</div><div class="date">25th November 2003, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">DrO, is it possible to capture output in real-time (or line by line)?<br />
<br />
I think someone was working on this, but can't remember...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">25th November 2003, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">it all depends on the program, some can and the version i was developing was able to handle most cases of those programs.<br />
<br />
unfortunately most don't seem to and the code can't access the screen data until the program finishes (in the thread further up i think i posted the relevant comment from microsoft about the issue).<br />
<br />
because of that the spinning star was the best way i could think of to indicate processing is happening (the dll attached fixed the display issues that were in the first version i put out). i need to fix the code for those programs that do handle real output (so it doesn't lose a few characters or repeat parts slightly) but is hard with only a few examples to work with :(<br />

<br />
I tried with one exe that does live output but your nsExec only prints it at the end. Do you want it?</div></div><hr />
