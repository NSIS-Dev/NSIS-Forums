<br />
I've been using NSIS for over a year and just recently a customer using Vista x64 has reported they cant install my app as they get the &quot;Warning Message&quot;:<br />
<br />
Not enough storage is available to process this command. <br />
<br />
I have a vague memory of getting this warning one time myself (ages ago) but cant remember what I did to fix it. There was plenty of space on the drive as I recall so its a misleading warning message.<br />
<br />
I've checked the forums here for the same problem and only one person has mentioned it.<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=274313<br />
<br />
I've also trawled the web and seen a couple of KBs but they aren't much use (no solution):<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/941384<br />
<br />
And this one too but it doesn't apply to Vista:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/225782<br />
<br />
There is another method to resolve the problem that requires changing registry keys but I am not so sure I want to instruct my customer to do this just yet:<br />

<br />
Has anyone else experienced this? It be great if someone can anyone point me to some possible root causes?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
