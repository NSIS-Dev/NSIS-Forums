<br />
    I am only just starting to use NSIS and I am very inexperienced so sorry if this is a silly problem, but I have been looking through the documentation and have not found a solution. My situation is that I have a program which zips up a larger program, and that larger program needs an installer/uninstaller. What I need to do is create an installer for this large program and I have chosen to use NSIS to do it with. I have been having a play and what I want to know is if there is a simple or standard way to make an installer that will open the zip file and install its contents . If there is no easy way then is there a way at all? The program that needs to be installed is huge, so I do not want to have to say 'put this file there' for every file in the zip folder, what I want is for the whole process to be automated, so within the installer ideally I want to just give it a zip file and have it do the rest (especially as the zip contents will be changeable over different versions).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer,<br />
<br />

<br />
nsis.sourceforge.net / ZipDLL_plug-in<br />
<br />
there are download plugins to download files via http if  the .zip files change periodically and you want them to be able to update the .zip file content easily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaydenDevlin</div><div class="date">5th July 2007, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah yeah that seems to extract files pretty much how I want, but when you try and uninstall the program the extracted files are ignored. How can you make the uninstaller uninstall everthing that was installed? Is it possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Let nsis compress the required files, after all it offers the best compression ratio, and if bothers you the preparation, simply use File /r instruction or you may give a try to Nsis Quick Setup Script Generator,<br />
