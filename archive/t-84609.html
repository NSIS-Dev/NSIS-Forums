<br />
As most of you would know, I admin the NSIS Project House on SourceForge.net. Well, we need some writers to post documents on Howto do something with NSIS. As most of you know, there have been alot of people who have asked for help recently and I wish for these people to have a central place for Howtos and other Info before posting here.<br />
<br />
How to submit info:<br />
If you are a user of SourceForge.net:<br />
1) E-mail me (duanejeffers@users.sourceforge.net) with your UNIX/Login name and tell me what you want to do (see below)<br />
2) Goto the Document Manager on our project homepage (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsisphouse/) and post a document.<br />
3) I will read it and if I believe that it is the right type of info (I will take editorial control for grammar mistakes and that is all I will rewrite the documentation for)<br />
<br />
If not a User of SourceForge and you don't want to sign-up:<br />
1) E-mail me a .txt document of what you want posted.<br />
(The first 3 lines are supposed to say the following:<br />
Title: &quot;Title Name&quot;<br />
Description: &quot;Description&quot;<br />
Author: &quot;Your Name&quot;)<br />
<br />
We are also looking for users to submit other projects.<br />
If you are a developer, let us host it even if it is for a mirror.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

- Simple FAQ's<br />
- Indepth HOW-TO's<br />
-- If so, on what?<br />
<br />
Also i think you need to adjust your website, cuz that link points to your directory, on SF. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">13th April 2002, 08:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes and yes. The How-Tos can be on anything the writer would like. Things like:<br />
Howto: Launch a Webpage after install<br />
Howto: Use InstallOptions<br />
Howto: Compress multiple files in NSIS using Bzip2<br />
<br />
What ever ... you write it and I will post it.<br />
<br />
