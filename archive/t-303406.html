<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ggp81</div><div class="date">23rd February 2009, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I'm going to explain my problem.<br />
I made an installer with NSIS 2.40+UltramodernUI. There is something wrong with the uninstaller.<br />
My uninstaller does some operations and asks the user e.g. if some informations must be preserved or not.<br />
The uninstaller correctly does the operations I wrote in the Section Uninstall, but at the end of all the operations appears a window asking me the path of the program to uninstall. After this the Section Uninstall is executed one more time.<br />
I would like that window to appear at the beginning of the Section uninstall, so that the section is executed once and not twice. I tried to comment some macro calls, but I didn't get the uninstaller to work correctly.<br />
Any suggestion or help is appreciated.<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
