<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">10th March 2006, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys<br />
<br />
I can't quite see what I'm doing wrong, but whatever. The problem has given me almost no feedback: I launch the uninstaller; a dialog box pops up saying &quot;Error launching installer&quot; and it quits. <br />
<br />
This is what I have:<br />
<br />
Basically, I include a few custom pages in the uninstaller. The &quot;un.&quot; naming is correct, as the thing compiles. Each custom page will use an ini file used in the main installer (although I haven't got as far as linking custom pages with ini files yet using &quot;!insertmacro MUI_INSTALLOPTIONS_DISPLAY &quot;something.ini&quot;).<br />
<br />
All the uninstaller has is a few custom uninstpage calls to empty (but existent) functions (e.g. &quot;UninstPage custom un.something un.something-Leave&quot;). <br />
<br />
The un.Init function reserves and extracts the ini files. These are exactly the same commands (as they refer to the same files) as those used in the .Init function.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">10th March 2006, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">On a related topic, is there any way to &quot;keep&quot; variables defined in the installer in the uninstaller, seeing as the installer writes the uninstaller on the fly? I basically want paths and stuff contained in the executable, seeing as the uninstaller may be moved to a different machine to work.<br />
<br />
I know this is unusual behaviour; the installer is actually being used to configure a remote database, so no local files are affected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th March 2006, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you'll have to write them to the registry or some file on the installer side and manually read them on the uninsntaller side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobGrant</div><div class="date">10th March 2006, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm ok fair enough. Is no variable written into the uninstaller at runtime? Even the install directory, anything like that? If so, I can use it :) If not, it's not a huge problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">10th March 2006, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">No variable is written to the uninstaller. The only things that go in the uninstaller are the stub, new icon and compressed uninstaller data generated at compile-time.</div></div><hr />
