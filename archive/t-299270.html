<br />
I was wondering if their are any known issues with unicode strings getting messed up in the unicode UNinstaller?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
T.<br />
<br />
Ps. sorry if this info is available, I tried a search but came up empty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">28th October 2008, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">you might want to ask in the big unicode post in this forum...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trixom</div><div class="date">29th October 2008, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Great one response and it's the local forum whiner...<br />
<br />
Posting in a huge topic kind of looses the point of a forum in my opinion.<br />
<br />
People searching for information end up in a post 60 pages long and just give up. You get 16 conversations through each other. Every time someone responds you check and it has nothing to do with your problem...<br />
<br />
But anyways thanks for nothing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">29th October 2008, 06:06</div></div><div class="posttext">dude, the unicode build is a 3rd party fork, and there is nothing wrong with the existing thread. Instead of just bitching, you could provide some more info about this corruption and a minimal sample script that reproduces it (And if you are real fucking lucky, I might even spend some of my time looking at it, but insulting me is not exactly the best way to get your issue to the top of the pile)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trixom</div><div class="date">29th October 2008, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Look, Dude..., If you respond with a one liner, don't expect people to react nicely. You whine, I bitch.<br />
<br />
But I appreciate you showing some indication of wanting to help.<br />
<br />
It's simple, I have an NSIS script and in the installer the unicode strings are fine, but in the uninstaller they are messed up. The strings are taken from the same source.<br />
<br />
So getting back to my original question, I was wondering if there was a known issue with the uninstaller part.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trixom</div><div class="date">29th October 2008, 09:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and btw, instead of creating one big post, try creating a separate forum for the unicode, makes things a lot easier.<br />
<br />
T.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anders</div><div class="date">29th October 2008, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">again, its a 3rd party fork, the forum for it would be @ http://www.scratchpaper.com/<br />
<br />
and again, I need to see a minimal sample script</div></div><hr />
