<br />
i wonder if anybody has come across something similar.<br />
<br />
I have two installers, a main and one that patches the other one. When the main one is uninstalls it removes the patch as well.<br />
<br />
Both the main, and patch installers have entries in add\remove programs (from the reg) which i remove. However windows doesnt recognise the second program has been removed, so it looks like it still needs to be uninstalled. Does anybody know how to get windows to refresh this screen?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">11th August 2005, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS uninstallers copy themselves to the temporary directory and execute from there. After executing the uninstaller from the temporary directory, the original uninstaller exits. This allows the uninstaller in the temporary directory to delete the original uninstaller. However, it also causes this issue. Windows 9x doesn't wait for subprocesses of the uninstaller to end. It only waits for the process it executed. You can force the uninstaller to not fork itself by using _?=$INSTDIR on the command line. This means you won't be able to delete the uninstaller, but the Add/Remove control panel will be updated once the uninstaller finishes. See chapter 3 (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter3.html#3.2) of the documentation for more information.</div></div><hr />
