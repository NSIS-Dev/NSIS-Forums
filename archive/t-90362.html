<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simham_uk</div><div class="date">8th June 2002, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have looked through the posts regarding OS version detection, and have a few queries:<br />
<br />
1. This thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=49039) shows a very usable method, but has to be built into NSIS.  Has this been implemented?  Could it be made into a DLL?  I like this method since it give all possible Windows versions and service packs in an easily usable format, with very little script code.<br />
<br />
2. This thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=70361) contains just such a DLL, but not delivering the same flexibility (I think).<br />
<br />
3. Functions.htm describes a function to do the detection, but not to the extent of number 1 above, or even number 2.<br />
<br />
Number 1 would be the preference since it has maximum flexibility with very little overhead.  Can anyone explain (if it is not implemented somewhere) how I could implement it without having to recompile NSIS  (don't know how to do that).<br />
<br />
Has anyone come up with a better method recently?<br />
<br />
Hope someone can help...I need to be really specific about the OS version.</div></div><hr />

Is there a more exact way?  Also, it doesnt require any nsis modification.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uhop</div><div class="date">12th June 2002, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an idea: check version of kernel32.dll in system directory using GetDLLVersion. If I am correct, it returns major version number, minor version number, and build number. This method doesn't require to use any external DLL or use customized NSIS.<br />
<br />
Another idea: check registry values. Unfortunately I forgot exact key names. Hopefully somebody will post them here. I remember it was easy to find them with regedit.<br />
<br />
Sorry for vagueness :o --- I used such tricks long time ago and don't use them now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check out this new thread re: a dll that does report service packs [ http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=90878 ]</div></div><hr />

<br />
These tools are great dude, just what I needed!!<br />
<br />
I don't suppose you know how to invoke an Internet connection? or have a DLL for it :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope not yet, but if I can find out/work out the proper way to do it I'll see what I can do. Do you just want to cause a dial up connection to be initiated (whatever the default one is) or do you want to initiate a socket connection to a particular place? I could probably make a basic socket client in a dll quite easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simham_uk</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunjammer, it's OK, Kichik is having a look at a solution.  When I get it done, I'll let you know!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the offer!</div></div><hr />
