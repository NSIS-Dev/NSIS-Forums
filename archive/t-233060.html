<br />
I have been using example 1 and 2 to achieve my final installer in a proper way.<br />
<br />
However, i have the following problems:<br />
<br />
1) how can i create a shortcut (at the desktop, no in the start menu). I want to be more clear.<br />
<br />
Using<br />
CreateShortcut &quot;C:\documents and settings\hc\desktop\app.lnk&quot; etc <br />
i can do it but how can i automatically know the path to the desktop because this CAN vary from user to user.<br />
<br />
2)Knowing this, i would be able to remove it too.<br />
<br />
3) The RMDir $INSTDIR is not removing the directories, I want to delete them, including the subdirectories<br />
<br />
4) My application must have first installed a lib.exe file that creates some libraries needed for the application.exe<br />
HOw can i handle this event? i mean, to control that the lib.exe file has been installed and then run the other?<br />
<br />
Hoping for the support and thanking in advance for this very nice tool,<br />
<br />
Hc.</div></div><hr />
