<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cadwal</div><div class="date">2nd February 2004, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I just had a shortage of bits when some numbers I have in a script grew beyond 4G. I were not doing any arithemetic on them, only comparing them so I thought it would be easy just to switch to strings.<br />
<br />
But IntCmp(U) is:<br />
<br />
val1 val2 jump_if_equal [jump_if_val1_less] [jump_if_val1_more]<br />
<br />
and StrCmp is:<br />
<br />
str1 str2 jump_if_equal [jump_if_not_equal]<br />
<br />
and of course it was less than and more than comparisons I were doing.<br />
<br />
I can't find anything in the current implementation that explains why this rather odd limitation is there (lstrcmpi works like any C strcmp AFAIK) and the <br />
&quot;best&quot; solution IMO would be to change StrCmp to work the <br />
way IntCmp works with the obvious exception of that breaking most scripts existing today.<br />
<br />
So lacking the &quot;perfect&quot; solution have anyone else already created an StrCmpX macro/function that works like this? (I could not find anything in the list archives or &quot;The Archives&quot;)</div></div><hr />

The Math plugin also happily does just the string comparison I was looking for.<br />
<br />
So for future searchers in this forum: strcmp, less than, greater than, math, plugin.</div></div><hr />
