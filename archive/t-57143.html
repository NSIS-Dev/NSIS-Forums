<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weridoman</div><div class="date">15th August 2001, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">For our program, we are going to be installing a third party software package that is required for our program to work. It is the Java Runtime Environment. We want to give the user a message box, asking if it is ok to install the software (msgbox with yes and no buttons). We want to do it so that if you click yes, the installation continues as normal, but if no is clicked then the installer quits. (we have written a test to see if the JRE is installed...if it is, we skip over installing the JRE; if it is not we want to pop up this message box, asking the user if for permission to install JRE, and either install jre or quit the program.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">You are wanting an Abort function. I have little clue to how this works, but you could try something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
MessageBox MB_YESNO &quot;Install JRE???&quot; IDYES installjre<br />
Abort<br />
installjre:<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying that this will work, but try it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weridoman</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. I tried that in the middle of my script....when the no button is clicked on my message box, the installer halts and just sits there. The installer does not quit itself, forcing the user to have to hit the cancel button. Is there another command to get the installer to quit completely? or am i doing it completely wrong? any suggestions from anyone would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DuaneJeffers</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">That is the way it was presented in the makensis.htm . But like I said, I had no clue if it was correct. The Abort tag is not used much unless it is in a function. There is no other way, but I will look and try and help you.<br />
