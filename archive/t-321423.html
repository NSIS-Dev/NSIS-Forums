<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikesch</div><div class="date">5th August 2010, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a problem on registering a DLL (3rd party) with my installer.<br />
<br />
First of all I assume it is not really a NSIS problem, because an older version<br />
of the DLL will be registered successfully every time.<br />
But nevertheless I hope to get help here. <br />
<br />
Now the description of my problem:<br />
<br />
I use RegDLL to register a DLL like this:<br />
RegDLL &quot;$INSTDIR\My.dll&quot;<br />
<br />
Usually this works fine!<br />
<br />
But now with a new version of My.dll the installer doesn't continue after RegDLL.<br />
<br />
I've tried to call RegSvr32 with ExecWait:<br />
ExecWait '&quot;regsvr32.exe&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\My.dll&quot;'<br />
<br />
The result is a success message from RegSvr32 but after this the setup also halts.<br />
<br />
With RegDllView I can see that in both cases the DLL was registered to the system.<br />
There is one other effect. It is not possible to delete the file unitl I re-boot my system, even if I de-register it.<br />
<br />
I think the main problem is in the new DLL. but I can't reach the developer of it :rolleyes:.<br />
Now I'm searching for some usefull ideas to bring him on the right way if he will back in office.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />
<br />

We were never able to solve it and had to just Hail Mary the RegSvr32 with Exec instead of ExecWait and provide the customer with a support item of the DLL failed to register.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The developer of the DLL fixed a bug and now my installer run as expected.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for reading my post.<br />
