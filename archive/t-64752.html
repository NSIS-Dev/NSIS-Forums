<br />
just to hook on to this question: i also need to register a tlb file for a delphi made com object. I solved it by including borlands tregsvr.exe in the installer. But, since i want to unregister it when uninstalling too, i have to include the tregsvr.exe in the uninstaller also. This means that i have to include 2 x 960 kB extra in my installer. Maybe it's an idea to put registering TLB's into NSIS itself ?<br />

<br />
The other possibility is to extract the regtlb.exe to your program directory (or a subdir), and call it on install and uninstall, then have the uninstaller uninstall it after it is done being used..<br />

<br />
thnx for the quick reply<br />
<br />
in the mean time, i made a little TLB reg util which doesn't output to the console (so you don't see the anoying console flicker  you see with regtlib). Anyway... if it could be done with NSIS we be even better.. I don't know what you mean with the symbols to call..<br />
<br />
i'm interseted in some experimenting though... let me know if you need something from me ...<br />
<br />
btw. if anybody is interested in the TLB reg tool in the mean time.. let me know, i'll mail it<br />
