<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garrel</div><div class="date">21st June 2002, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to use NSIS to launch another installer <br />
so that I can modify the installation when it is <br />
complete. I can't just use NSIS to replace the binary <br />
installer as suggested to others. The problem, like others <br />
have posted in this forum, is that the other installer <br />
launched via ExecWait launches additional processes after <br />
it starts and my NSIS installer continues as these processes <br />
are started. For example, I use ExecWait to launch setup.exe, but <br />
then process _isdel.exe shows up in my Task Manager, and the NSIS installer continues before the other installer even gets started.<br />
<br />
Can you think of a way around this? If I attempt to run <br />
_isdel.exe, it starts but then exits. However, when setup.exe <br />
launches it, it stays resident during the installation.<br />
<br />
Uhg.<br />
<br />
If it helps, I'm trying to launch (and wait) for the MySQL for Windows (GPL license) database installer, and it uses InstallShield.<br />
<br />

<br />
nsis looks only for the process which starts when another exe has benn started this cant work.<br />
<br />
but if its only mysql then its no problem to install it by yourself with nsis<br />
<br />
just install mysql in a dir (c:\mysql)<br />
<br />
then<br />
<br />
copy the WHOLE dir to anotherpath where u want to build your nsis<br />
<br />
then add the whole path to your project thats it.<br />
<br />
if u want to make startmenu entries and others i thick u know how.<br />
<br />
mysql dont use any ohter dll in win dir thatswhy its easy to install it.<br />
<br />
the start command for mysql as a service<br />
is described in the install.html in mysql</div></div><hr />
