<br />
My app is sold inet only so the setup file, setup.exe, is downloaded to the users' <br />
computer via the link I send them.<br />
With some users on Vista and XP sp3, the EXE extent of my setup.exe file is removed by the OS or the AV or the firewall, I don't know which.<br />
With some users, they can save the file and add the .exe; with others, there is no such option to save under a different name, it will simply save to desktop as setup, no extent.<br />
Then, a windows office icon is created which, when dbl-clicked, gives Unknown File Type and asks user to select app to open it.<br />
I have the same problem with my demo file, demosetup.exe.<br />
<br />
How can I create a demo/setup exe file that will work properly on these pesky OS's?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoscoBilly</div><div class="date">24th April 2010, 02:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.<br />
Thx for responding.<br />
This info is from a user.<br />
What he says is the file, setup.exe DL-ed from my site, appears as an icon <br />
on his desktop with no extent after saving, with no option to &quot;Save As'.<br />
He says:<br />
&quot;Going through the process again, when I get to the point of save, I do not see an option to save it as an exe file.  The option is; Unknown file type, 1.37 MB,   3.amazonaws.com  Save or Cancel  And it saves to the desktop if you click save &quot;<br />
And is saved as setup, no .exe.<br />
When he dbl clks it, he gets &quot;unknown filetype&quot; and the &quot;open with&quot; dialog.<br />
<br />
Note: the 3.amazonaws.com above refers to the DL server, on amazon. <br />
<br />
Any help on this would be most appreciated.<br />
Thx.<br />
Billy</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess would be that either the S3 server isn't providing the correct MIME type for the file (application/octet-stream), or the user's browser is ignoring it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoscoBilly</div><div class="date">24th April 2010, 06:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for the suggestion, Anim.<br />
You have seen this before?<br />
If so, would you please give some examples?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to chk the S3 server output MIME setting.<br />
Is there a way to set a property of a file on S3 to effect this?</div></div><hr />

Yes - mostly with FireFox users as Internet Explorer used to (maybe it still does - I hardly use it anymore) determine the file type based on the extension rather than the MIME type.<br />
<br />
If so, would you please give some examples?<br />
Can't say I know of any currently mis-configured server :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to chk the S3 server output MIME setting.<br />
I'm not sure where you would check in S3 / your server's settings... but if you happen to use FireFox, then the LiveHTTPHeaders add-on ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829 ) will at least let you see what a server sends as a response before the browser begins its download.<br />
<br />
Example 1 of a correctly configured host (using IIS).<br />
This uses the generic &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; MIME type.<br />
GET /dir/file.exe HTTP/1.1<br />

<br />
Example 2 of a correctly configured host (using Apache).<br />
This uses the more specific &quot;application/x-msdownload&quot; MIME type.  It also specifies the Content-Disposition filename parameter which a browser -may- optionally use as the name under which to actually save the file, but can't be relied on - but if the MIME type checks out you could see if this parameter is set (incorrectly).<br />

I will try to chk this.<br />
However, this behavior is not for all Windows boxes.<br />
For example, I have tested many XP sp2 boxes where the extent is not removed.<br />
Would this suggest that the MIME encoding is not at fault?<br />
<br />
Also, I have never seen the behavior where there is no option to &quot;save as&quot;, even if the extent is removed.<br />
In fact, in my instructions to users, I tell them that if the extent is removed, be sure to save it as setup.exe then dblclk to run.<br />
<br />
It seems like an overzealous nanny security setting.<br />
I'm wondering if there is a way to &quot;cloak&quot; my setup.exe self-extracting install.<br />
<br />
