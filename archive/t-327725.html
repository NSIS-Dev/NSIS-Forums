<br />
Is it possible to read the contents of a remote text file (http server), without having to download the text file to the local machine?<br />
<br />
Right now, i use INETC to obtain the text file, save it locally, read it, close it, compare values.  I really dont want to do that, as that's how I verify version and password of a local tool i use.<br />
<br />
i just want to be able to read the password from the website, and use that as a variable inside of the script.<br />
<br />
Can this be done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">22nd February 2011, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I would argue that you shouldn't read a password. You should read a hash of it instead. Otherwise no not without writing your own dll/exe or modifying inetc to do it. It would be a handy feature of inetc I would agree (a /tostack option).<br />

<br />
I really dont want to have to download the password.txt from my server lol.<br />
<br />
I keep reading that there are other ways to validate input, like passwords, etc, but none really w/o hard coding the password inside of the script file.<br />
<br />
Any good solutions out there to validate user input in order to launch the installer?  Like, maybe a php script, or something that can be used?<br />
<br />
Dunno, just frustrating :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zackrspv</div><div class="date">22nd February 2011, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">There is this plugin:  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsisUrlLib_plug-in<br />
<br />
However, even when following the instructions, it doesn't seem to ever return anything.<br />
<br />
  <br />
NsisUrlLib::UrlOpen /NOUNLOAD &quot;http://www.mydomain.com/text.txt&quot;<br />
NsisUrlLib::IterateLine /NOUNLOAD<br />
Pop $1<br />
<br />
<br />
The above variable, $1, actually is blank.<br />
<br />
if i were to Pop $R1 right after the UrlOpen, i'd see some sort of transfer error.  nothing other specific than that.  If it'd work, this would rock, and solve the issue of reading remote files, but, sadly, not working :(</div></div><hr />

When possible you should always avoid having a copy of the actual password. Also instead of downloading the hash/password, instead POST the hash/password to a web script which does the validation and outputs some success string. Note that this could be bypassed by using a proxy or by changing the hosts file.<br />
