<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">6th August 2008, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm stuck with a function using WordFind, partly because the documentation is written in a bad english. maybe somebody with good knowledge english and wordfind can update the description (especially the part about the options).<br />
<br />
Loop:<br />
  ${WordFind} &quot;${LineContent}&quot; &quot;;&quot; &quot;+1&quot; $1<br />
  DetailPrint &quot;$1&quot;<br />
  ${WordFind2X} &quot;${LineContent}&quot; $1 &quot;;&quot; &quot;-1}}&quot; &quot;${LineContent}&quot;<br />
  StrCmp &quot;${LineContent}&quot; $1 0 Loop<br />
End:<br />
<br />
what i'm trying to do is parse a string with semicolon seperated words (e.g. &quot;forest;wild animals;tree;fox&quot;). i'm using the above loop to seperate the original string into the first word and the rest of it, then run a loop. the function is working quite well, though at some point i figured the option -1}} does not exist. every now and then there's a problem when a &quot;word&quot; contains spaces. in order trying to fix this i have tried several other options WordFind2x offers, though the description makes it hard to understand what they actually do. to my suprise my function worked as before, though this also means that sometimes words are left out.<br />
<br />
if you can help, please let me know!</div></div><hr />
