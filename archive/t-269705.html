I'm not even sure you can include a section in a conditional.  Anyhow, any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">17th April 2007, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">other options i have considered are using the installoptions pages or somehow using accesscontrol, but the latter seems kind of unclear to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">24th April 2007, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">just wondering if anyone had any feedback on using accesscontrol to do a user vs everyone install.<br />
<br />
Should I get the account type with userinfo then somehow use accesscontrol to install?  I'm just sort of unclear as to how to use accesscontrol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th April 2007, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The AccessControl only modifies access to certain files or registry keys. What you want is to check if the user is an administrator and install to the proper locations in that case. If the user is just a plain old user, don't write into HKLM and don't install into $PROGRAMFILES.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">24th April 2007, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your reply.  If I don't install into program files, where should I install to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th April 2007, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Somewhere where the user can write files, like his My Documents folder. It's one of the less ideal places, but you can be sure it's writable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackkoho</div><div class="date">24th April 2007, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  I will try this and see if it works out.</div></div><hr />

I don`t have the same Problem but its close to yours.<br />
I have to program a Installer where a few Files hafe to extract, and after that step some of them should be started by   the Installer.<br />
Till here it works. But one of the them must be started from a nother user with admin rights. But i don`t know how!<br />
There must be a parameter which instructs the installer to run the specific .exe as User p3.vpn and with Pass. XXXX e.g.<br />
Till today my command looks like this:<br />
ExecWait '&quot;C:\KillProcess.exe&quot; probeService current|p3.vpn' <br />
but this does not work.<br />
Do you have any ideas?</div></div><hr />
