<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dprutean</div><div class="date">18th June 2012, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created an installer with NSIS for my java application. After install and startup of the application, the application tries to update itself ( override application lib jars with jars downloaded from internet ) . This operation fails because Windows does not allow this. Which settings should I change in NSIS to make this possible ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSG</div><div class="date">18th June 2012, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Several options.<br />
1) Modify your app to demand admin level.<br />
2) Install to a world-writable or BU-writable directory, for example $APPDATA under shellvarcontext all (not sure how to check world-writability for a user-defined path, but shouldn't be impossible)<br />
3) Make install directory BU-writable (dangerous - protected directories are protected for a good reason, you shouldn't remove it)<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to use option 2, installing to $APPDATA under all-user context. You could of course also install to any directory and put only the lib jars in $APPDATA.</div></div><hr />
