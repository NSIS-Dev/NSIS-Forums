<br />
I have done some searching, and all I have found are posts related to setting a .bmp file as the wallpaper. I would like to know how to set a .html as the wallpaper.<br />
<br />
I am trying to make an installer that installs a HTML file to the user's Program Files directory, and set it as the desktop wallpaper. From what I have seen, setting a .bmp as the wallpaper involves using the System plugin to call a function in the user32.dll. After searching on the MSDN site, I found this: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776357(VS.85).aspx<br />
<br />
If I'm not wrong (I really don't understand a bit at all of how DLLs in Windows work), IActiveDesktop is an Interface in the shell32.dll file, and the SetWallpaper member will allow setting a .html or .jpg as the desktop wallpaper. Since IActiveDesktop is an *interface* and *not a function* in the shell32.dll, this should mean that the usual way of calling a function in a DLL using the System plugin cannot be used.<br />
<br />
There is some code here http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=1386259#post1386259 mentioning IActiveDesktop, but it looks a bit complicated and I can't understand what the part commented &quot;#create IActiveDesktop interface&quot; is trying to accomplish. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how (after creating the IActiveDesktop interface) to access a member of the interface? (SetWallpaper in this case). Or, better yet, it would be really nice if someone has a working piece of code to set .html  or .jpg files as the desktop wallpaper. (and if necessary, refresh the Active Desktop to apply the new wallpaper straightaway)<br />
<br />
 Many thanks for your patience.</div></div><hr />
