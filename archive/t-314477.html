<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daucool</div><div class="date">9th November 2009, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I haven't really posted on here before, but I do a lot of NSIS work. Thanks for all the great threads that have helped me along the way!<br />
<br />
I wanted to report (heads up Tahkir :)) some issues with the inetc plugin which I am struggling with.<br />
<br />
First up, we have a couple of installers where we track the whole process of installations using requests to the web (using a combination of NSISdl and inetc). One of the installers has an unusually high fail rate compared to the other. In the tracking I decided to pass the returned inetc error message as an extra parameter, and the result was the following:<br />
<br />
SendRequest     631<br />
Cancelled     150<br />
Terminated     93<br />
Transfer     36<br />
File     9<br />
SendRequestError     4<br />
SendRequest Error     4<br />
TransferError     3<br />
/TIMEOUT     2<br />
<br />
Most of these are self-explanatory, and I believe that &quot;SendRequestError&quot; means that there is no internet connection? My question is, what does &quot;SendRequest&quot; status error mean, and why do we have so many of them on this particular installer? I've tested it from multiple locations and component is coming from a reliable CDN - any thoughts? (perhaps the CDN is truly less reliable!)<br />
<br />
The second issue, perhaps more serious as its a coding bug. I am forced to use NSISdl as well as inetc because NSISdl is able to make a SILENT call onInit to a tracking script.<br />
<br />
As it stands, if you use inetc to make a silent request onInit, the installer loads in a minimised state and it is impossible to restore it programmatically! BringToFront, SendMessage, none of these work. I had this confirmed by AfrowUK and he told me to contact Tahkir.<br />
<br />
Anyway, any advice on the above would be much appreciated!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ucool</div></div><hr />

};What are numbers near messages in you post? Is this a statistics? For me &quot;/TIMEOUT&quot; looks like wrong command line or a stack content. Plug-in not reads all items or reads wrong items from stack. May be because of wrong URL item you have so many SendRequest Errors. Please note that plug-in may continue reading stack for the next URL/File pair if command line is not limited with /END parameter.</div></div><hr />
