<br />
I'm migrating from the bug-ridden InstallerVISE v3.51 to NSIS.<br />
<br />
I've got a basic installer working, in the sense that the script has no errors, and it seems to run nicely. Only problem is -- the files are never installed!!!<br />
<br />
Building the script shows that all the files I ask it to install are compressed, and my installer is 270381 bytes out of a total of 1328042 bytes.<br />
<br />
Running on XP as an administrator.<br />
<br />
When running the installer, I can see that it appears to decompress all the files, but the screen goes by so quickly that I can't see much more of that.<br />
<br />
So, where do I look / how do I debug this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
Yippee!!!!<br />
<br />
I miss InstallerVISE's drag-and-drop ability to add files, and also its Build Directives and Build Targets (I was using both, x15 each, in a very complex installer).<br />
<br />
However, its bugs (esp. w/regard to including archives) got to be too much, and so I'm switching to NSIS based on an exhaustive recommendation.<br />
<br />
So far, I'm quite happy. Will take time to learn all the tricks.<br />
<br />
