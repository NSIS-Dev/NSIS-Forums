<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MajinSephiroth</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 23:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have taken a look at the wiki, documentation and most of the examples but one thing still remains un-answered in my head. <br />
<br />
I guess I am getting confused from replies to posts that are similar to what I am about to ask.<br />
<br />
So I have compiled some of the examples that come with NSIS and see how they work, the principle is very basic and easy to understand. There is however one thing I have not understood. I have a full directory structure that I need compressed inside the compiler, but this directory structure has more than 100 folders and over 1000 files... don't tell me I have to specify all the files and folders using the &quot;File &lt;insert filename&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
I have taken a look at the CopyFile function, but, I am puzzled by:<br />
<br />
&quot;CopyFiles $INSTDIR\*.dat $INSTDIR\backup&quot;<br />
<br />
Does it compress all the files and the directory structure they have as outlined in a .dat file? <br />
<br />
It really just is a huge confusion that won't let me wrap my head around it.<br />
<br />
So let's assume I have the following directory structure with files as follows:<br />
<br />
/MainFolder<br />
|+SubFolder<br />
||file4<br />
||file5<br />
|file1<br />
|file2<br />
|file3<br />
<br />
<br />
How would I add them to the installer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
File /r &quot;MainFolder&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />
