<br />
As do I draw the symbol &quot;|&quot; from the variable $RO?<br />
<br />
What I want is to obtain names separately, and in this way for example to erase regitry's keys or a directory's files.<br />
<br />
I right now have a script that gets keys from registry, and it shows them by means of MessageBox.<br />
<br />
I was trying to do it writing $RO in a file ini, but no himself like separating words. In order to be able to obtain everything that this contents between the symbol &quot;|&quot;, including spaces ... For example this result of EmbebedList: <br />
<br />
Result: |It Was Adjacent day|Today it is a morning beautiful| That you have face today|<br />
<br />
And obtaining :<br />
<br />
$3 Was Adjacent day<br />
$4 Today is a morning beautiful<br />
$5 That you have face today<br />
<br />
Sorry for my so bad English<br />

<br />
<br />
StrCpy $R0 &quot;hello|my name|is|Afrow UK&quot;<br />
<br />
Loop:<br />
Push |<br />
Push $R0<br />
 Call SplitFirstStrPart<br />
Pop $R1<br />
Pop $R0<br />
<br />
MessageBox MB_OK $R1<br />
StrCmp $R0 &quot;&quot; 0 Loop<br />
<br />
The MessageBox will display each separate string from start to finish.<br />
The function that you need to include in your script is here:<br />

I translate the all indications (on google translate, sorry for all spelling errors) in script attached, but this is the use that I gave your plugin, I hope that you like. I believe that it would be good for documenting, the possibility of update of the options and items of plugin in its execution, like for example using it to see values of the registry, since these       are changers, if we use them in different computers. Here this scriptÂ¦<br />
<br />
Only tested in XP. I do not know if it works in other versions of Windows<br />
<br />
They are needed following plugins for its script operations: EmbeddedLists (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/EmbeddedLists_plug-in) Registry (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Registry_plugin); Taken care of which plugin with he himself name exists another one, to use this.<br />
The following file must exist in the directory of script.nsi in the compilation of he himself: test.ini ; this file must be empty.</div></div><hr />
