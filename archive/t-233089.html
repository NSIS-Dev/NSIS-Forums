<br />
I am again about our website copying. Currently our uninstall section is just as big as install one. We would like to have some registration facility. E.g., for certain file or group of files copied during installation, we would like to specify that it is to be deleted on uninstallation. In some other, more convenient way than specifying pair 'Delete' to each 'File'. What can we use within NSIS to satisfy ourselves ?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your replies.</div></div><hr />

You can also delete using wildcards.<br />
<br />
However - if you want to ONLY delete the files you installed, see:<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Uninstall_only_installed_files<br />
<br />
However, I don't think it works with wildcards<br />
So another method may be to save the install log (see the NSIS help for example code), and parse that log with your uninstaller routine.  The install log -does- list all files, even when using wildcards.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, stick with the large file, but put the many File lines in a separate file, and !include that</div></div><hr />
