<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">njosephson</div><div class="date">14th November 2007, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If I use an RTF formatted file for my license file there is a noticable delay before it appears.  The page shows up with the license portion blank - it is even worse when using modern or ultra-modern ui, there you actually have to drag the mouse over the text to get it to appear.  The problem doesn't seem to affect it when I use a .txt file.<br />
<br />
Anyone experienced this or found a workaround?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th November 2007, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">ReserveFile won't affect the license file as the license isn't kept in the files block, it's kept in the string table. The string table is always at the top of the compressed data along with the other headers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">njosephson</div><div class="date">16th November 2007, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The rtf license is 23k.  Does anyone else use RTF license files?<br />
<br />
Also the problem appears in all versions of the ui, including the classic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">17th November 2007, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">NSIS doesn't dump the license file anywhere. It's in the string table and it's not scanned. I've used RTF licenses in the past and they worked fine. I just tried with a 100kb RTF and it loaded instantly. Maybe there's something special about your RTF? Try another one.</div></div><hr />

Oops! Wrong installer, then :p</div></div><hr />
