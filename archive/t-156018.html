<br />
Is there an easier way then uninstalling and reinstalling the editor to get that back or a way I can prevent it from dissapearing that anyone knows of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, from first look at the code, it's not supposed to do that. Unless of course the editor changes more then it needs to chage... Actullay, if that happens, it's surely the editor's fault. I have changed the program used to edit from notepad to my own and the NSIS installer have never changed it back.<br />
<br />
Until it's fixed you can simply override the files in your NSIS directory. There is no real need to run !InstallNSIS.bat. The only thing the installer does in this case that simple ZIP wouldn't, is registering the file extensions and creating an entry in the Add/Remove control panel.</div></div><hr />
