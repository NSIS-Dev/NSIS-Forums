<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petersa</div><div class="date">26th April 2001, 04:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops! I didn't mean one of the files while it's in the archive, I meant to have a shortcut point to an extracted version.<br />
<br />
What I mean is you run the EXE file, you enter where you want the files to be extracted, and then a shortcut is made not to the original EXE, but to an extracted file.<br />
<br />
You would only need to unzip the EXE file once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a good idea is to be able to just save the .NSI file created, instead of building the EXE file.<br />
<br />
This way, one could customise the .NSI file before building it. This would be good for installations with plenty of files, because it would take a long time to fill out all the details by hand!</div></div><hr />
