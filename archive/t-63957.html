use this: <br />
<br />
Rename [/REBOOTOK] source_file dest_file<br />
<br />
Rename source_file to dest_file. Functions just like the win32 API MoveFile, which means you can move a file from anywhere on the system to anywhere else, and you can move a directory to somewhere else on the same drive. If /REBOOTOK is specified, and the file cannot be overwritten, then the file is moved when the system reboots. The error flag is set if the file cannot be renamed (and /REBOOTOK is not used) or if the source file does not exist. <br />
<br />
<br />
You can then check the error flag and give the user a message if necessary</div></div><hr />

Forgive me for being an idiot :), but if I use the Rename method, the file has to already be installed, my file NEEDS to be installed.  Should I install all the files to a tmp and rename the files in question?</div></div><hr />

Ok, I did some reading on Microsoft.com and can't find what types of files support just putting the dlls in the app directory.  Now, on a test win98 box, I put all the files in the app directory, but I still had to register a few dlls for my software to work right.  If I register these dll's, won't that tell the system to use the dll in my app directory rather than another copy that is installed (meaning, breaking other apps)?<br />
<br />
Do you have any links/text/help on what files a vb app will look for in its directory?<br />
<br />
Ive been working with Visual Basic for about 5 years, but distribution wasnt my job, so this is my real first crack at DLL Hell.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I may be wrong, but I don't think you have to register MSVCRT.dll<br />
<br />
If you put it in your app directory, then all should be fine.<br />
<br />
About the easiest method I've found to determine if a DLL needs registering is just to try it.  Run regsvr32 from a command line with the path/name of the DLL as the parameter.  If it says it can't find the entry point, then you don't need to register it.</div></div><hr />

remember that VB applications aren't programs in their own right, they contain a strap that loads the vb runtimes which in turn execute the byte code in the '.exe' file, thus the applications actual directory where code is executed is the system directory where the vb runtime dll file is ... I think (not sure though, I haven't used vb before.. this is just what I can tell from seeing vb programs).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I probably should've said that too.<br />
<br />
You need to first of all extract the file to a temporary location.  /REBOOTOK will put the appropriate stuff into wininit.ini, so the file will be moved next time the machine starts up.<br />
<br />
This is neccesary as the installer will not be running as the machine is starting up, so the file must be extracted by the installer before the reboot.  Wininit then does the moving.<br />
<br />
Why is this thread so wide????????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">locnar42</div><div class="date">29th October 2001, 03:24</div></div><div class="posttext">One silly thing to keep in mind, sometimes the $TEMP directory will be cleaned at shutdown, startup, or just by a user who wants to clean up.  If you are going to extract files to rename on reboot, it would be better to put the files into $INSTDIR\temp or the destination directory but with a different extention.  That way they stick around long enough to be renamed.</div></div><hr />
