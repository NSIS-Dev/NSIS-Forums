<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saschagottfried</div><div class="date">12th September 2006, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to realize a progress bar with the RealProgress plug-in for an update, where I have an indexfile for the files on a DVD with the corresponding filesizes appended after the target path of the file.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
+ /targetpath/ 2456<br />
<br />
means: <br />
add file to targetpath with Size 2456 in kB.<br />
<br />
My strategy is to parse the whole file, sum up the filesizes to get a overall amount of data to be copied. During the copy process I will read every line again into a &quot;CopyFiles&quot; command. Thus I read the fileSize again. <br />
<br />
For the progressbar I will pass the parameter:<br />
<br />
&quot;current fileSize&quot; / &quot;Full amount of data&quot; to put this value as a parameter to the progressbar.<br />
<br />
But it seems not to be possible to pass a floating point parameter to RealProgress:FileProgress (the doc is not that  precise for that function *g*).<br />
<br />
I would like to have this new topic as a feature request for  this plug-in.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I try something like this. Sum up the filesizes until they are at least one percent of the total amount of data to be copied. Then increase the progress bar by 1% and reset the the variable that sums up the filesizes. <br />
Probably this would be also a good implementation idea for this requested feature. Just take the floating point value as a parameter that will be summed up in the &quot;background&quot; and still just pass an integer to the progress bar when the sum hits a certain integer threshold.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Afrow UK and everybody else for his work on RealProgress.</div></div><hr />
