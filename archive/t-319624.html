<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coliveira</div><div class="date">2nd June 2010, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">In my uninstall section, I am using LogSet/LogText to write messages to the install.log file. It works perfectly if I run the uninstaller manually or through add/remove programs.<br />
<br />
However, in my install section I run my uninstaller passing /S and _? and this is where LogSet and LogText do not work - the uninstaller does not write anything to install.log.<br />
<br />
I tried setting an alternative OUTDIR using SetOutPath thinking that it was trying to write to a file that was already opened for writing, but no dice.<br />
<br />
I read through the documentation, and the only relevant option I could see was SilentUninstall, but the silentlog option isn't available for the uninstaller (not even sure if that would accomplish what I am trying to do).<br />
<br />
It could also be that install.log is opened for writing in the install section, and trying to open it again in the uninstall section is causing problems. Or logging does not work in silent mode.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any experience with this?</div></div><hr />

If it's in a page callback then you need to move it because obviously they don't get called in a silent (un)installer.<br />
