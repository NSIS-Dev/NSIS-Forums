<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes131</div><div class="date">6th November 2010, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to throw this out there.<br />
<br />
I still have to investigate more, but basically, I downloaded the latest<br />
NSIS and the Ultra Modern UI, all within November, and built a new<br />
install on my Windows Server 2008 machine, so that I could capture<br />
some screen shots and test more with the problem of the Welcome<br />
screen appearing on top of the running Uninstall window.<br />
<br />
I ran the Install on another, XP Pro SP3, dev machine, and as soon as the<br />
Install phase started, I got a pop-up from ZoneAlarm saying that something was<br />
trying to get out, on the internet, to 80.190.143.232:DNS<br />
<br />
I've NEVER seen any NSIS Install get any pop-ups of anything wanting to get out before.<br />
<br />
The XP machine has an up-to-date Avira, and no problems with viruses, or malware.<br />
<br />
The server just has the stupid Windows Firewall running, which gives no<br />
warning at all, of course.. :-\  So I installed PC Tools Firewall, and as soon as the<br />
Install phase starts I got this pop-up:<br />
<br />
&quot;NSFEB is attempting to use another process Net Command with parameters (...)&quot;<br />
<br />
and if you click on &quot;NSFEB&quot; it gives:   ....\Local\Temp\Nsv3ce3.tmp\Nsfeb.tmp<br />
( the exact file name changes )<br />
<br />
Then it gets pretty much the same pop-up at the end of the Install.<br />
<br />
Of course that firewall puts a zillion pop-ups about every interaction<br />
of apps, but at least it notified me that something was trying to &quot;get out&quot;..<br />
<br />
Maybe this is nothing, I don't know, but I've done plenty of installs,<br />
but not that many with the Ultra Modern UI, and I've never seen any firewall pop-ups.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll try to re-build NSIS from the source, but I don't know.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  I might have &quot;solved&quot; the issue of the Welcome screen &quot;hiding&quot;<br />
the running Uninstall window.  After the Uninstall starts, I let it go down<br />
into the Uninstall some, then do a:<br />
<br />
	Sleep 1500<br />
<br />
	BringToFront<br />
<br />
And brings it back on top of the Welcome screen, for now.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes131</div><div class="date">6th November 2010, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, on the Server, I found out what the two &quot;Net Command&quot;s where,<br />
those where okay.<br />
<br />
At the start of the Install, I sent a command to stop my Service<br />
and when the Install was finished I sent a command to start the new Service, so that part, on the Server machine anyway, was okay.<br />
<br />
But the ZoneAlarm popping up that notification, on the other machine, of something<br />
wanting to get out was totally different.<br />
<br />
Also, I re-installed NSIS and the .zip of the Ultra Modern UI.  before I<br />
downloaded the &quot;combined&quot; NSIS/******odern UI and that overwrote the original<br />
NSIS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your ZoneAlarm alerted you to a connection to 80.190.143.232 .  IP lookup tells me that IP belongs to AVIRA GMBH.  So maybe you have some Avira product installed which decided to do an online lookup of.. something? For whatever reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes131</div><div class="date">7th November 2010, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that sounds about right.<br />
<br />
Maybe Avira decided to try to get out to do an Update.<br />
I tried to look-up that IP and got something that seemed<br />
weird.<br />
<br />
Sorry about all this.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
