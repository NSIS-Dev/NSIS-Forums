<br />
I've got a MUI2 based script, building and working fine on XP and Win7, build with NSIS 2.46.<br />
<br />
However, if I run the installer from a Network drive (E) it will crash on Win7 when the following is executed:<br />
<br />
  CreateShortcut &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\App\App.lnk&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\app.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
The prior CreateDirectory &quot;$SMPROGRAMS\App&quot; is however fine.<br />
<br />
If I run the program from the local drive, it's okay and install completes normally.  If I comment out this line, the install is again okay (but no Start entry!).<br />
<br />
I've got a RequestExecutionLevel admin at the top of the script, and in both cases I get a UAC verification prompt when running the installer.  Unfortunately the crash doesn't give much info:<br />
<br />

How can I stop this crash, or get some info towards debugging it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MookMcStook</div><div class="date">8th December 2011, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\Driver&quot;<br />
<br />
I checked and that dir does exist (some files are unpacked to there previously).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MookMcStook</div><div class="date">9th December 2011, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - it's working now!<br />
<br />
I tried moving the script around to create the shortcuts first (just after SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;) and that started to work.<br />
<br />
So I went back and put the .nsi to how it was and retried to confirm the fix.  But now it is still okay...<br />
<br />
I'm using SVN so can be sure the script is exactly as it was when the problem was found.  The only difference is that I closed some Dos boxes on the Win7 machine - I'm not sure if they somehow held a handle to something important?<br />
<br />
I'm afraid this looks like one that got away.  Maybe there is an error path from CreateShortcut which crashes in some rare situation which I can no longer reproduce... I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
So while I'm happy that the installer now works in all my tested configurations, I'm also worried it might crash on a user somewhere...<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what else I can do here.</div></div><hr />
