<br />
I have seen tutorials on how to make a progress bar on a custom dialog page, but not how to control the one on InstFiles.  <br />
<br />
I extract a lot of files and then run a few steps that take a long time, and the progress bar is sitting at around 90% for all of the steps at the end since there were so many files to extract.  I would like to have better control of it.<br />
<br />
Also, on the steps that take a long time, I call an exe that takes a little bit of time to run but does not provide any feedback to the user.  Are there any suggestions as to what could be done on the InstFiles page so that it does not look like the installer has locked up?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the slow execwait step, you can use one of the banner plugins for that.</div></div><hr />
