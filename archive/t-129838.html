<br />
. Our small company wishes to hire an expert<br />
  in NSIS install to help out with an installation.<br />
<br />
  This should be a few hours work. All work done by email.<br />
<br />
  Company: ReadPlease Corporation, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada<br />
           http://readplease.com<br />
  <br />
. Please provide by email to: rob@robmccormack.com :<br />
    - Rate per hour in $us, <br />
    - Brief experience with NSIS/.msi/ other install<br />
      tools like InstallShield et.<br />
    - State experience with large install (like 200-400 megs)<br />
    - and when you could start.<br />
    - where you live<br />
    - reference of work you have done with NSIS <br />
     <br />
    - State if you can download a 400 meg file via FTP?<br />
      we could send it on CDROM.<br />
    - State what OS's (all PC based) you can test install on.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
Scope of work<br />
<br />
. We have written a nice .nsi install for<br />
  our NEW product ReadingBar http://readingbar.com<br />
  This installs SAPI 5 (runs the .msi file from NSIS)<br />
  and seems to work well.<br />
  Please try the install. We would later provide you with the .nsi<br />
  script.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
. Tasks<br />
<br />
- We need to add to this install the<br />
  AT&amp;T Natural Voices install (400megs, done in Install Shield)<br />
  but can be done in NSIS<br />
<br />
- We are thinking of having ONE install for<br />
  three products, ReadingBar, ReadPlease and AT&amp;T Natural Voices.<br />
  If AT&amp;T NV was selected to be installed, it would ask<br />
  user for a password.  The other products password<br />
  is entered once the install is complete.<br />
<br />
  The checking of the AT&amp;T password would have to be done<br />
  INSIDE of NSIS script.<br />
<br />
- Must be multi language and be like the install we now have<br />
  done in NSIS.<br />
<br />
- I have written a .msi for AT&amp;T install, it wasn't too bad,<br />
  maybe 12 or so Reg entries, and a few other things.<br />
  Would expect you to run PC Magazine InControl to make sure<br />
  the NSIS install is exactly the same as AT&amp;T install<br />
<br />
- Test on Windows XP, 98, 2000, NT if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks for considering our request.<br />
<br />
