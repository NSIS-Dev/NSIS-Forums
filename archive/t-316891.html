<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jammusi</div><div class="date">8th February 2010, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
As I have several scripts that needs the share some functionality - I took out the relevant functions / variables into another common.nsi file that is included in all other scripts (last one on the list)<br />
<br />
It turned out that this &quot;external&quot; nsi does not recognize the build in variables (e.g: $INSTDIR,$EXEFILE or any of the mui various value like $mui.FinishPage.Run - the finish page run check box handle)<br />
<br />
The problem occurs in run time â€“ not compile time â€“ when I realized that any of the above are not populated.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to overcome this?<br />
<br />
Tx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jammusi</div><div class="date">8th February 2010, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I'm wrong about EXEFILE but its not only this one.<br />
<br />
I first discovered it with the run check box handle $mui.FinishPage.Run. It took me a while to understand why something that worked stopped working<br />
<br />
After that I realized that almost every (if not all) variable I was referring in the commom.nsi - is not populated.<br />
<br />
So I simply returned everything to the original scripts - duplicating back all the common functionality.<br />
But - this is only because i had no choice.<br />
<br />
any idea?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jammusi</div><div class="date">15th February 2010, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">As a workaround I have declared other variables within the common script and populate them before activating the shared functionality. This way i only had to duplicate the variables population in each script..<br />
<br />
I am not sure what do you mean by &quot;headers&quot;. Is this the common script I use?<br />
<br />
Tx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th February 2010, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Usually you name those common.nsh and use them as a header file. There is no actual difference between the two. It just makes it easier to look at the code later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jammusi</div><div class="date">15th February 2010, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.<br />
Thanks for your help. For now I will stay with my workaround - but i will try to do that in some other time (too less time - too many tasks ;-))<br />
<br />
I have another question you might be able to answer shortly...I want to write setup log file.<br />
It there a way to convert all the current &quot;DetailPrint&quot; to write also into log file?<br />
Is there a build in command or a plugin that can do that?<br />
<br />
I actually plan to write such a plugin and publish it (not that i currently know how to do that), but as i need the log file i though it might be helpful for others.<br />
But - if there is already such a solution - that is even better...<br />
<br />
