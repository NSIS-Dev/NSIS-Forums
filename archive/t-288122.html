<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jrhutch</div><div class="date">7th March 2008, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I was curious if there is a way to control settings for a windows network connection setting. Specifically, I would like to find a way to turn off certain network protocols during an install (NetBios and IPX, IPv6, and one other protocol). I am using NSIS to create upgrade packages, and this is one request that's on the table. <br />
<br />
I've looked through various plugins and the Docs, but didn't see anything that sounded like it could do it. Any suggestions or advice?</div></div><hr />
