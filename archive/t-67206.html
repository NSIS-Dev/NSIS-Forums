<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BitRider</div><div class="date">30th November 2001, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all there,<br />
<br />
Here is a new L-NSIS release, have fun !!<br />
<br />
Homepage (http://www.geocities.com/rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis/index.html) <br />
Direct download (http://www.geocities.com/rincon_de_jmcb/lnsis/lnsis1672.zip)<br />
<br />
Direct download link appears to not work, so try with homepage, from there you will be able to download without problems.<br />
<br />
It seems this is the end of the project I started a few weeks ago. It wasn't thinked as an alone project but as the installer for another program I'm currently developing.<br />
<br />
Nobody has reported bugs, ideas or anything else. It appears like if nobody is interested on it or like if it is so complete that nobody has nothing to say about it (well the first reason is the most realistic). L-NSIS does everything I wanted from it to do and NSIS haven't so for me this project is ended unless I discover serious bugs.<br />
<br />
On screen texts refreshing will not be implemented as long as it does mean a lot of work in rewriting UI.C in order to not increase the size of the exeheader. I've no time to do it &amp; I haven't any good reason to do it, it's not really useful for me.   <br />
<br />
What's new in version 1.67.2<br />
<br />
* Perhaps the last L-NSIS release<br />
* Little optimizations (little optimizations in 'L' code + exeheader compiled with stdcalls)<br />
+ Added L-extensions.txt, a help file.<br />
+ full FileErrorText support (it wasn't rightly supported in previous version)<br />
+ Added to SetText: InstTypeX (where X can be 1..MAX_INST_TYPES (8 by default))<br />
+ Added to SetText: CustomInst<br />
- Removed SetText value: LicenseData (now not really useful)<br />
+ Added function: LoadLicenseData file_name (for me it's smarter &amp; more useful)<br />
+ Added function: SetSectionName original_name new_name</div></div><hr />
