<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigfooot</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">!macro StrReplace SOURCE_FILE SEARCH_TEXT REPLACEMENT<br />
  Push &quot;${SOURCE_FILE}&quot;<br />
  Push &quot;${SEARCH_TEXT}&quot;<br />
  Push &quot;${REPLACEMENT}&quot;<br />
  Call RIF<br />
!macroend<br />
<br />
works fine on all the others, just not this one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The insertmacro line, not the macro line.<br />
<br />
If it tells you there are too many parameters it's probably a missing quote. For example: &quot;C:\Program Files\My Program&quot; would <br />
qualify as 3 parameters if not quoted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigfooot</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry about that<br />
!insertmacro StrReplace $INSTDIR\php\pear\PEAR_ENV.reg :\ :\\<br />

!insertmacro StrReplace $INSTDIR\php\pear\PEAR_ENV.reg &quot;:\&quot; &quot;:\\&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
this makes a lot of sense<br />
i tried<br />
!insertmacro StrReplace $INSTDIR\php\pear\PEAR_ENV.reg :\ &quot;:\\&quot;<br />
<br />
and it worked, thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

Once you quote it, it should work. I have copied the second line from your message and it worked. Are you sure the second one doesn't work? There is no reason it'll treat the next line as an extension if the last char is a quote.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok, nm :)</div></div><hr />

i hear yea, it should have worked, i have no idea why it didnt<br />
<br />
but if a take the quites of of the find variable and leave them on the replace variable, it works</div></div><hr />
