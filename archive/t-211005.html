<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrby</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
First let me say THANKS to developers and those who<br />
answer the questions.  Great system! :up: :up: <br />
<br />
Now my question:<br />
<br />
I want to create shortcuts in a specific folder, within the normal start menu path, but I want to allow the user the option of choosing the FIRST LEVEL folder under the normal path, i.e.:<br />
<br />
 blabla\Start Menu\OPTIONALFOLDER_OR_NONE_\SPECIFIC_FOLDER<br />
<br />
but I cant seem to figure out how.<br />
<br />
If I DONT specify MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER the start menu defaults to my Name attribute which I dont want.<br />
If I specify MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER &quot;&quot; (null), the page gets skipped completely.<br />
If I specify MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER $SMPROGRAMS<br />
it ALMOST works okay, but any folder the user clicks on gets<br />
PREPENDED to the variable.  This last option is closest to what I would like if there was a way to specify to append rather than prepend the selected folder.<br />
<br />
Actually what I would really like would be to have the startmenu textctrl be completely blank with the listbox containing the 1st level folders, The user could choose the<br />
1st level folder (or none), and I could then append the specific folder I want.<br />
<br />
Any advice on how to achieve this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrby</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for your suggestion, but I was probably unclear (notice time I posted). ;)<br />
<br />
I want to show the STARTMENU page to allow the user the &quot;opportunity&quot; to enter something, ie the OPTIONALFOLDER_OR_NONE. I have no idea what it would be or even care if the user enters.<br />
<br />
I DONT want to do:<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER<br />
&quot;$SMPROGRAMS\SPECIFIC_FOLDER&quot;<br />
<br />
cuz 1.) anything the user clicks on PREPENDS to the string as in :<br />
 C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Start Menu\Programs<br />
and user clicks on a folder in listbox, say Accessories, then Accessories gets PREPENDED to the string, i.e.:<br />
 Accessories\C:\Documents.......<br />
and 2)<br />
I dont want to allow the deletion/replacement of the SPECIFIC_FOLDER at all.<br />
<br />
Closest I can get to desired behavior seems to be<br />
!define MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER &quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
but the Startmenu Page then shows with a single, selected<br />
(highlighted) blank in the text control.  I suppose I can<br />
live with this though it looks a bit funky.<br />
<br />
I was hoping someone knew how to change the behavior of the Modern UI so it would still stop on Startmenu page when<br />
MUI_STARTMENUPAGE_DEFAULTFOLDER is not defined, and knew how<br />
to get it to APPEND the folder the user selects to the text ctrl instead of PREPENDING the text.<br />
<br />
I see ${NSISDIR}\Contrib\Modern UI\System.nsh IS??<br />
the Modern Ui Implementation? Any idea where in there to start looking to try to modify the behaviour?</div></div><hr />
