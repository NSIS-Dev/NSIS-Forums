<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChocJunkie</div><div class="date">7th October 2009, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to make an installer that runs two installation pages.<br />
 So far that's no problem.<br />
When the first install process is finished, I would like to change the text (and function) of the next button depending on the result of the process. I know, it's useless to call the commands to change the code at the end of the section, the installer uses. If I would do that, my function call would be a part of the installation and when the installation ends, NSIS itself changes the button.<br />
So I would like to call my function AFTER the sections have been executed. How can that be done?<br />
<br />
I know, I could place a custom page after the first install process to show the results, but that's not what I want.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />

Sections are executed in the order of their script appearance.<br />
<br />
Section &quot;-LastSection&quot; LastSection<br />
;do your button mods here?<br />

I think it's, because if I call my function inside a section, it's still inside the installation process. At the end of the installation NSIS changes the buttons. <br />
<br />
I've tried to modify the button using the leave function of the page, but it's the absolute same result. I could see that the buttons are changed from NSIS AFTER the leave function was executed.</div></div><hr />
