<br />
my script creates a directory (&quot;$PLUGINSDIR\dll&quot;) and puts a DLL in that. at some later point, it will delete the dll again. however, from there on the directory will be inaccessible, i can neither read from it nor write to it. opening the directory (dll) in explorer gives me an &quot;access denied&quot; message. when i replace the dll with any other file, the problem does not occur.<br />
<br />
happens on both win7 and xp, the latter using no extra protections like antivirus software.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">10th March 2011, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">seems it can't delete the empty directory for the dll-file (DELETE PENDING), so i guess windows treats dlls differently as it works with other filetypes</div></div><hr />

<br />
it should be recreated, as the filestructure (dll\MyFile.dll) exists within the 7z file i'm extracting to $PLUGINSDIR. and as i said before, it works with other filetypes.</div></div><hr />
