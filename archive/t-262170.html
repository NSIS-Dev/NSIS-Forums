<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">billsh</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen some posts that touch on this topic, but I haven't grocked exactly how to do it.  Say I have a bunch of lang-specific files in my setup (added via File &quot;blah blah&quot;).  <br />
<br />
At runtime I want to detect I'm on a Spanish system and only copy Somefile.spa vs Somefile.jpn.  How can I do that?  I've seen reference to CopyFiles using $Exedir, but haven't managed to make it work.<br />
<br />
Is the general approach that you have to explode everything and *then* selectively delete vs selectively copy from the compressed file?  I've looked around in the samples and haven't seen it (or don't know that I've seen it!  ):)  <br />
<br />
I'm from the MSI world where we'd simply put a condition on a feature/component.  Does NSI have the same concept/functionality or does it always all files?<br />
<br />
Code snipped would rock if its anything other than CopyFiles/Delete.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">You could prompt users to select their desired lang. Take a look here (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Common_Installation_with_Components_Choise)  for a sample related script. Anyway you may examine the target system for local settings, windows version, user privileges, required runtimes etc, and set sections on/off. You have the option to pack your files within the installer or store them  unpacked. Also you may download files at runtime execute them and continue your installation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">billsh</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the hints!  The direction I'm trying to go now is to have a section for each lang file ala:<br />
<br />
Section /o &quot;Korean&quot; kr<br />
    File &quot;Foo\kr\Foo.exe&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section /o &quot;English&quot; en<br />
    File &quot;Foo\en\Foo.exe&quot;<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
etc<br />
<br />
My main section will then turn on the section that matches the lang I detect as the system lang, or what they select.  I try to do that via:<br />
<br />
SectionSetFlags $(LANG) ${SF_SELECTED}<br />
<br />
where LANG is en, kr, jp, etc<br />
<br />
This never appears to work.  I always get a Copy Failed in the details pane.  <br />
<br />
I've tried calling this SectionSetFlags from within my main section and via calling a function from the main section.  I've tried hard coding values vs using these vars.<br />
<br />
I've put the lang section defs before and after the main section trying to catch any scope/defn issues.  I'm not sure if there is any specific info I can gather from IfErrors other than there was an error vs getting detailed info (aka GetLastError()).<br />
<br />
I saw some posts suggesting using macros in LogicLib, but if that is included it chokes on LangString definitions saying it was expecting 3 vs 4 params.<br />
<br />
I'll keep playing with it and read more posts.  <br />
<br />
It seems similar in logic to posts I've seen so maybe I'm doing something illegal by calling it within a section vs a function, or some sort of order issue, etc.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas what might be up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">!include LogicLib.nsh<br />
;<br />
;<br />
;<br />
;<br />
${if} $LANGUAGE == &quot;English&quot;<br />
SectionSetFlags ${en} ${SF_SELECTED}<br />
${else}<br />
SectionSetFlags ${kr} ${SF_SELECTED}<br />
${endif}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">billsh</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I've tried calling SectionSetFlags ${en} ${SF_SELECTED} explicitly to test and still get the copy failed error.  i.e.<br />
<br />
Function SetLanguageSection<br />
    SectionSetFlags ${en} ${SF_SELECTED}<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
which is called from my main section.  Does it matter if I call SectionSetFlags from a function vs a section?  Neither appear to work for me, so that maybe a moot point! <br />
<br />
Including LogicLib.nsh gives me LangString errors:<br />
<br />
LangString expects 3 parameters, got 4.<br />
Usage: LangString [un.]name lang_id string<br />
<br />
They compile fine w/o that header, so not sure what is up there.  I've tweaked the order of the includes.  Same errors if LogicLib is there<br />
<br />
In theory if calling SectionSetFlags directly fails I've got a bigger problem than the LogicLib issue. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">billsh</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks!  I've got it now.  I think I was getting tripped up by trying to be clever (Read:lazy) and having a single line:<br />
<br />
SectionSetFlags ${LANGUAGE} 1 <br />
<br />
where my section names mapped to the same string (in your example) as the LANGID numbers.  For some reason that never worked out correctly.  <br />
<br />
So something like:<br />
<br />
section /o &quot;english&quot; 1033<br />
   sectionin 1<br />
sectionend<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Pop $LANGUAGE<br />
...<br />
<br />
SectionSetFlags ${LANGUAGE} 1<br />
<br />
Maybe that can work and I've just got the syntax horked.  I tried a few variations, but never hit it.<br />
<br />
If I do the long form where I StrCmp against all X versions like you did and set them explicitly it works.<br />
<br />
If you know why my previous all-in-one attempt fails that would be nice to know, but I'm good now and that is the important thing!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Wine</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The syntax for section is:<br />
Section section_name section_id<br />
The syntax to set flags is:<br />
SectionSetFlags ${section_id} 'flag'<br />
So, what is supposed to do the SectionSetFlags ${LANGUAGE} 1<br />
Is there any section with id LANGUAGE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">billsh</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">My attempt is to create a variable that contains the section name (en, kr) and have the SectionSetFlags call use that var so I can have a single call.<br />
<br />
I must have had something else wrong earlier as now this appears to work.  So something like (in pseudo code for brevity):<br />
<br />
if English<br />
StrCpy $(lang) &quot;en&quot;<br />
<br />
if German<br />
StrCpy $(lang) &quot;de&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
SectionSetFlags ${$(lang)} 1</div></div><hr />
