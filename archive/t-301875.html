<br />
We have some sub projects (which typically install a small tool) which we use in other larger projects.  I would like to create NSIS installers for the smaller projects that I can then reuse in the larger projects (which typically take a selection of the small tools and package them together).  Is there a good way to do this?<br />
<br />
Steve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrisAster</div><div class="date">9th January 2009, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You can include .NSI scripts in a main .NSI project.  So, what I've done is separate certain sections of my installer into sub parts and then have thin main projects that include many of the sub-components or sections.  It prevents duplication of work, it doesn't have the overhead of a whole MSM, it's easy to track in versioning software.  I prefer this method to MSMs myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This sounds like exactly what I want to do - are there any examples of this way of doing things around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">12th January 2009, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">There won't be examples of this because as most examples are typically quite small we do not need to split them up.<br />
<br />
It's quite simple. When you use !include File.ext you are effectively copying the contents of that file into the current script where you have put the include statement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrisAster</div><div class="date">12th January 2009, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The basic idea is something like this:<br />
<br />
This is sharedtool.nsi<br />
<br />
Section &quot;-Hidden Shared Tool&quot;<br />
  File &quot;blah&quot;<br />
  ; Set registry settings or whatever<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Installer that uses shared tool:<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Component 1&quot;<br />
  ; Files<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
; This line would be in every installer that you would<br />
; want to have use the shared code<br />
!include &quot;sharedtool.nsi&quot;<br />
<br />
Section &quot;-Post&quot;<br />
  ; Settings<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is just the most *basic* example.  For all of this to work it needs to have some forethought.  Do you want to share sections? lists of files?  It's all up to you.  I keep track of all the installs myself so my system is a little... sloppier, for lack of a better word, but it's quick and easy.  If you have multiple developers for the same setup, you may need to think it out a bit more.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
