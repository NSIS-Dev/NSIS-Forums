<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koen van de Sande</div><div class="date">16th November 2001, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to develop a Delphi database application soon - but I'm not sure what kind of database I should use. It is a program, which runs in a network with 3-5 computers and a laptop.<br />
It is a database with healthcare patient information, and every computer needs to access it (the laptop will replicate the database for offline usage).<br />
My question: how do I create a shared database? Do I need a special SQL server? Paradox tables sound nice, and perhaps XML if that's possible.<br />
Is my case fit for a remote database (don't know what it is, but it's in my database book).<br />
Can anyone tell? Because I don't know which way to choose (you can do it in so many ways).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

It's a very bad book I have - or I have to read more ;)<br />
These terms aren't even mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mkeeley</div><div class="date">18th November 2001, 01:34</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience Paradox isn't very good multi-user. Single user with the odd additional user isn't too bad but more than that problems with lock files become a pain.<br />
<br />
DBISAM is small and links in to the EXE and supports most SQL, there's also a client server version. There is an ODBC driver for it but don't know how good it is but whether you care depends on your reporting needs (if you're going to use QR, ReportBuilder... then it's not a concern).<br />
<br />
Another alternative is to use an MS Access database which you can link to with either ODBC or ADO. The obvious advantages of going MS is all reporting tools will link to it as will MS Office.<br />
<br />
Don't think XML is currently at the stage to be used for this type of database app, remember it's only a text file and will be either completely ready in to memory or converted in to a &quot;real&quot; database.</div></div><hr />
