I'm creating an installer for a mod for the game Dawn of War, but when I run the uninstaller which is created by my installer only the shortcuts are removed and all the main files aren't.<br />
<br />
I've attatched the code, any help would be thankfully recieved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pawcio</div><div class="date">19th October 2005, 00:33</div></div><div class="posttext">If the /r switch is used, matching files are recursively searched for in subdirectories. If a directory name matches, all of its contents is added recursively. Directory structure is preserved.<br />
 <br />
You don't have to specify each file!<br />
<br />
Before RMDir You have to type SetOutPath as well!<br />
<br />
take look in manual about rmdir and file</div></div><hr />

Before RMDir You have to type SetOutPath as well!There's no need to use SetOutPath before RMDir. On the contrary, it might interfere because you can't delete the working directory and SetOutPath sets the working directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">20th October 2005, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The working directory might be set to $INSTDIR which is why RMDir /r $INSTDIR would not work (if this is the case).<br />
<br />
Thus you should use SetOutPath $TEMP first.<br />
