<br />
First newbie question for you all...<br />
<br />
Is there a simple way to recursively delete directories that are empty or only contain other empty directories?<br />
<br />
Our products have many nested directories and it can see it becoming a bit of a bind to remember to include every level in reverse depth order so they get removed.  I know about the RMDir /r but that seems very dangerous - it could delete a user's data.<br />
<br />
Out of interest why does NSIS not use the &quot;log of installed files&quot; approach to uninstalling,  instead  requiring me to list all my files again?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
NSIS is a script based system, the installer sections do not have to match uninstaller sections. You can however create a log file during installation and use it during uninstallation.</div></div><hr />

OK.  That's what I am doing - it just seems to be a recipe for disaster since if I miss one sub-dir the whole parent directory structure will remain,  despite being &quot;empty&quot;.  Guess I'll just have to be careful! ;) <br />

Presuably I'd have to do this manually somehow - write to an INI file as I copy files and read it back from the uninstaller?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response.<br />

Yes. You can put it all in a macro to make it easier to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunyunkin</div><div class="date">17th March 2004, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">As a result of my previous questions,  I have written a plugin that will delete all subdirectories of a given directory if they are empty or only contain other empty subdirectories.<br />
However there is an issue with linkage - I'm using findfirst,  strcmp and various other functions - which then give me unresolved externals in Release builds.<br />
I can resolve this by linking to LIBC but am I then asking for trouble?  Can I assume everyone has the required support (it adds dependencies on Kernel32.dll and NTDLL.dll to my plugin DLL)?</div></div><hr />
