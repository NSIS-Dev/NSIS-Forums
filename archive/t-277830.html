<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thinhare</div><div class="date">24th September 2007, 07:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I was trying to pack a windows IME (Chinese) using NSIS. To put it into language bar, I added a key into HKCU\Keyboard Layout\Preload and had to reboot to make it take effect.<br />
<br />
Is there a way, such as SendMessage, to make it work without reboot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CancerFace</div><div class="date">24th September 2007, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can add keyboard layouts on the fly for a running thread. Check this (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Adding_Keyboard_Layouts_for_other_languages) Wiki page.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thinhare</div><div class="date">24th September 2007, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks CancerFace. That has been very helpful.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a clue of how to use System::Call, which dll to call (user32 or shell32), what parameters to pass. It would be great if you could shed some light...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CancerFace</div><div class="date">24th September 2007, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">If you refer to the system plugin in general, a good start would be its help (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/System/System.html) page.<br />
<br />
Also, MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com) is a good source of information on the windows API. And then there are many examples of API usage on the web as well as on the NSIS forum.<br />
Finally Google (http://www.google.com) is your friend (especially groups (http://groups.google.com/))<br />
<br />
Between those you should usually be able to find an answer, or at least to identify the function that you need to call.<br />
<br />
Once you know what API function to use, then it is (usually) pretty straight forward to get the required parameters from MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com).<br />
<br />
There is a neat addon for firefox, a search engine that parses MSDN directly. Get it from here (http://mycroft.mozdev.org/) (search for MSDN Library), if you use firefox ...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
