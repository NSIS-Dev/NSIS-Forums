<br />
I know that to delete any file using NSIS script we need to <br />
<br />
use delete command but if some one wants to delete the file <br />
<br />
which is in use (that is forcefull removal of file)</div></div><hr />

<br />
     I tried this delete /REBOOTOK filename but still its <br />
<br />
not working. The problem is after uninstalltion if i <br />
<br />
install my script it pops up message the this file can not <br />
<br />
be open for writing . and my system is crashing.<br />
<br />
even if i try to delete it manually I am geeting a message <br />
<br />
can not delete file already in use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">16th June 2007, 14:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I say /REBOOTOK because that means the file will be deleted on reboot. You should not delete files when they are locked by another process, although you can using a program such as this one (http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/W-P/files/fileio/article.php/c1287/).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gugaliashashank</div><div class="date">17th June 2007, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks afrow but ther is restriction for me that i dont want to use any exe for this.<br />
<br />
And the file i am trying to delete is a com dll create by me only<br />
<br />
I am registering it <br />
<br />
in Section -Post using<br />
<br />
RegDLL filename<br />
<br />
and unregistering it <br />
<br />
in Section Uninstall<br />
<br />
UnRegDLL filename<br />
<br />
and then delete it in uninstall section<br />
<br />
but its not getting deleted<br />
<br />
and the problem occur when some body tries to install after uninstalling. Coz every time i am rewriting the dll while installation and its crashing my system with error that dll is already in use it is not possible to open it for writing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">17th June 2007, 09:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Without the exe I cannot help you really, unless you want to convert that exe code into a plugin.<br />
<br />
Ideally, you should just ask the user to restart their computer after an uninstall.<br />
