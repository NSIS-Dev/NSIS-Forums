<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">16th February 2006, 01:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using InstallOptions to display a DropList of languages that will be used to launch various links on a menu.  I have the translation for the Korean word for English.  This translated word contains a '|' and it is causing the word for English to be listed in the DropList as two entries.  Is there a way to get around this?  I've tried escaping it with a '\' and '$\' but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dienjd</div><div class="date">16th February 2006, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, sorry, I don't know how to get around this with InstallOptions, but I just translated &quot;English&quot; from English to Korean, and the translation did not contain a &quot;|&quot; : http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr<br />
<br />
In ANSI format the value is &quot;¿µ¾î&quot; -- again, no &quot;|&quot;<br />
<br />
Am I misunderstanding what's happening with your script? Where did you get your translation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">16th February 2006, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">From a translator that my company hires.  It could be that your translation isn't for English the language and just the word (or people) English.  Or maybe mines the screwed up one.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I was trying out IOEx again with the latest beta and images aren't showing up, so that's a no go...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldy1064</div><div class="date">16th February 2006, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, as it turns out I'm stupid.  Our translator couldn't seperate what I wanted so it turns out that the translation I had was English seperated by a bar and then Japanese.</div></div><hr />

No, latest is 2.4.4 beta 2, and I've fixed the images problem already.<br />
<br />
Now, about the East Asian display in InstallOptionsEx: I still can't test the problem you're having, and you could have said from which version did this problem start from. It's not ok for me to keep guessing where the problem occurs in the code. I use string functions throughout the entire code. If you can't help me, then I can't help you.</div></div><hr />
