<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kolos</div><div class="date">13th July 2004, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to use a dll, I've written for an installer created with NSIS, but I'm stuck.<br />
<br />
This is my code:<br />
<br />
system::call &quot;my.dll::my_func(*l .r0) i .r1&quot;<br />
<br />
The signature of the function written in C is this:<br />
int my_func(long *number);<br />
<br />
The function was supposed to write a value to the place pointed by number (eg. *number = 42), which actually works (debugged in the dll source), but it doesn't get into $0, which would be desirable.<br />
<br />
This is where I get confused. Am I supposed to allocate memory (create buffer with system::alloc) for $0? Because I'm not allocating any memory in the dll source. Why doesn't the value get back into $0?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help in advance,<br />
Kolos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">15th July 2004, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">You're not supposed to allocate memory, System.dll takes care of that. However, System.dll is meant for calling DLLs which are not NSIS plug-in. If the only purpose of this DLL is to pass a value to the installer, you should write a plug-in for NSIS using the skeleton in Contrib\ExDLL.<br />
<br />
As for the problem with your current DLL, I suggest you first make sure the DLL is really called. If it's not called, make sure it's somewhere System.dll can find it. The current working directory is a good place (set it using SetOutPath). If the functions is called, attach your script. That specific line seems OK, but the problem might lay in other parts of the script</div></div><hr />
