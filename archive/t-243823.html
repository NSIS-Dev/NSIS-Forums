<br />
I'm getting into the installer and now it seems that I know how to differ from Compile-Time Commands and Run-Time Commands :) but there my problem begins...<br />
<br />
I've got a project where I have to add the JAVA Runtime Setup, and I extract that to the Temp-Folder and run it from there. The problem is, the filename is jre-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.exe and with every new version that will change. So my favourite way of handling this would be defining a Constant named &quot;JAVAFILE&quot; or something at the top of my script, so that I can change it there once (altogether with some possible other weird filenames that may occur) instead of searching through my script and changing it everywhere by hand.<br />
<br />
This doesn't work because it seems that there are no user constants - is that correct? With variables it won't work either, because they are not defined at Compile-Time, so the file won't be included.<br />
<br />
The only thing that would work right now is renaming the file into javainstall.exe, but that's bad either because the installer won't be used only by me, so I'd have to tell everybody first to rename the file into something else etc.<br />
<br />
So, is there something I overlooked? Or is everything hopeless :)<br />
<br />
Nice greetings<br />

<br />
So my question is answered... perhaps this thread will be helpful for someone else though :)</div></div><hr />
