<br />
What I want to do is to install a non-signed driver over a signed driver (I know this will send a warning in windows and thats perfectly fine). Be able to do this in Windows Vista 32 and 64 (I know I need to modify the boot settings and the installer will prompt the user at the start of the install). Be able to Properly uninstall the device and remove the driver and entries.<br />
<br />
Also how to create a shortcut that requires to be ran as an administrator under Windows Vista.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truth Unknown</div><div class="date">11th April 2007, 04:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone help with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CancerFace</div><div class="date">11th April 2007, 07:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried devcon.exe (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311272)? It supports various options for hardware detection/installation/management.<br />
Note that I have not tested this in Vista!<br />
Hope this helps<br />

Either due to it's a unsigned driver (Windows does request consent of the driver) or its incompatible.</div></div><hr />

Yes I've looked at it and did use the plugin as mentioned in the first post. I know it lacks support for vista and uninstall procedures. Which brings up the reason I asked here, so I wouldn't waste time in something if it was already done. I hope you can understand about that, but I guess I must give it a try. If I do find something, I'll post it here.</div></div><hr />
