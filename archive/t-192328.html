<br />
I've just installed XP sp2.<br />
When I download an exe using explorer and I execute it I have a warning windows with<br />
Author unknown (this is my translation by a language that is not English).<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility to set the executable (with NSIS) so that the<br />
Author is known?<br />
<br />

<br />
Slashdot had an article about free certificates:<br />

Your certificate must be issued by a CA (certificate authority) that IE trusts.  Here are links to a couple of them.<br />

<br />
Off hand I don't know of any that hand these out for free. <br />
<br />
There is a way to create your own certificate using openssl, but you will also need to create your own CA, and this CA information (root certificate) will have to be imported into IE of the machine that will be doing the downloading.  This method is not good for software posted on the web, but works good for internal corporate environments where you can control the end users PC somewhat.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah I looked at that www.cacert.org site.  They do give out certificates, but their certificates are not trusted by IE by default.  So you have the same problem in this case as generating your own.</div></div><hr />
