<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pocketfox</div><div class="date">5th November 2008, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all.<br />
I've searched everywhere, went the trial and error route, and still no luck. Here's what I'm trying to do:<br />
<br />
I have an application that saves user data to the common application data folder (C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\My company\my application). The uninstaller I created for this app does not remove this application data folder...no biggie. However, I have an update to this application, and I would like it to remove the user's application data folder during the installation as to avoid conflict with my updated application. <br />
<br />
I've tried placing delete variables in every section, creating new callback functions, and nothing. Please note, I'm a fairly novice user, and any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks for reading :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AaronLS</div><div class="date">7th November 2008, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried:<br />
<br />
RMDir /r 'C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\My company\my application'<br />
<br />
This will delete the directory and all contents, so be careful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Note that the current working directory can not be deleted. The current working directory is set by SetOutPath.&quot;<br />
<br />
See additional notes on this in the users manual.<br />
<br />
So you might need to do something like:<br />
SetOutPath 'C:\someotherexistingdirectory'<br />
RMDir /r 'C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\My company\my application'<br />
<br />
This is untested code, I think you might need to use double back slashes or forward slashes.  Beucase the \ might be treated liek an escape sequence.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also note that deleting things from All Users might require administrative priviliages.<br />
<br />
You can add the /REBOOTOK flag to allow the delete to occur after the computer reboots.  This is useful if the user has that folder open which might prevent the deletion, or if a file in the folder is opened/locked by some app.</div></div><hr />
