<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">4th November 2005, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed that there are no real naming conventions in NSIS.<br />
e.g.,<br />
<br />
!define &quot;&quot; &quot;xyz&quot;<br />
<br />
is a valid command- the compiler accepts it.<br />
However, there is no way to use this defined &quot;symbol&quot;.<br />
e.g.,<br />
<br />
MessageBox MB_OK &quot;${}&quot;<br />
<br />
displays &quot;${}&quot;, not &quot;xyz&quot;.<br />
<br />
A couple of exceptions I have found are:<br />
<br />
 A label cannot start with !,0-9,$,-, or +. (However, after the first character in the label name, anything is fair game.)<br />
 A GoTo target cannot start with 0-9, $, or !. (ditto)<br />
<br />
The absence of any real naming convention should normally not be an issue since I doubt that many people are creating weird names for functions, sections, labels, variables or symbols, but it still doesn't seem right.<br />
<br />
Why do I bring this up? Well, I am developing an IDE for NSIS in Eclipse (see link in my signature), and it is really difficult to create a syntax highlighter/checker when the scripting language is so freeform.<br />
Hence, I was wondering what were others' thoughts on this issue. <br />
<br />
So... should there be a naming convention for NSIS?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">12th November 2005, 00:45</div></div><div class="posttext">My short answer: absolutely!<br />
My long answer: however, I think most languages have notable exceptions like that, and a syntax highlighting engine would simply have to deal with those.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd just exclude the use of quotes in a define, period.<br />
E.g.<br />
!define &quot;foo bar&quot; &quot;hello world&quot;<br />
is perfectly legal - but it's pretty zany coding :)<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
I've found other things to be far more concerning, really :)<br />
(though they don't affect syntax highlighting, I think)<br />
<br />
For example...<br />
<br />
Why does RMDir, by default, not remove non-empty directories...<br />
But DeleteRegKey, by default, does remove non-empty keys?<br />
I.e. in the first instance you have to specify /r if you want it to delete the dir, even if it's not empty - and in the latter you need to specify /ifempty to make sure it's not deleting keys that aren't empty.<br />
Might be semantics..<br />
<br />
In terms of programming, however...<br />
Why is it<br />
StrCpy &lt;output&gt; &lt;input&gt;<br />
and<br />
SectionGetText &lt;ID&gt; &lt;output&gt;<br />
<br />
I.e. why is the output sometimes the first argument, and sometimes the last ? (perhaps even things inbetween, haven't encountered that yet though)<br />
<br />
I'm mostly used to scripting languages going :<br />
&lt;output&gt; = &lt;something&gt;<br />
e.g.<br />
&lt;output&gt; = &lt;input&gt;<br />
and<br />
&lt;output&gt; = SectionGetText &lt;id&gt;<br />
I understand NSIS uses a language more akin to C, but these (to me) inconsistent bits had my brain hurting in the beginning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's like in a DLL function call: you can't put spaces, but the compiler shows in the list of DLL calls plug-ins with spaces in their names... I could just use &quot;CallInstDLL&quot; to be able to call plug-ins with spaces, but there is no plug-in existant that has any spaces in their names, so it's not really that useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iceman_k</div><div class="date">12th November 2005, 05:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The only issue would be backward compatability.<br />
However, I don't think you would find many people doing something like this:<br />
<br />
!define &quot;${foo}&quot; bar<br />
<br />
This is a perfectly valid command- compiler accepts it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengyou</div><div class="date">12th November 2005, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of my installers use code like this:!define &quot;${foo}&quot;<br />
!define &quot;${foo}&quot; &quot;${bar}&quot;<br />
!define &quot;abc_${foo}_xyz&quot; &quot;${bar}&quot;because they use the MUI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">12th November 2005, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Does ${foo} in those instances contain spaces ?<br />
If not, the quotation marks aren't needed ?<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Overall the define stuff doesn't matter so much to me, if the only purpose of a fix would be to remove the non-issue (imho) of being able to define an empty var but not being able to refer to it :)</div></div><hr />

Most of my installers use code like this:!define &quot;${foo}&quot;<br />
!define &quot;${foo}&quot; &quot;${bar}&quot;<br />
!define &quot;abc_${foo}_xyz&quot; &quot;${bar}&quot;because they use the MUI.  <br />
<br />
Do you really define symbols like &quot;${foo}&quot;?<br />
Or do you mean:<br />
<br />
!define &quot;foo&quot;<br />
<br />
Because if you really mean:<br />
<br />
!define &quot;${foo}&quot;<br />
<br />
then you should refer to it in code with &quot;${${foo}}&quot;. Unwieldy at best.<br />
<br />
What I mean when I said the compiler accepts:<br />
<br />
!define &quot;$foo}&quot; bar<br />
<br />
is that it accepts it even if &quot;foo&quot; has not been defined.<br />
Essentially it allows you to define a symbol whose literal name is ${foo}.</div></div><hr />
