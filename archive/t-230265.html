Some of the following values will not be used by older Windows versions.<br />
<br />

Note: If both ParentDisplayName and ParentKeyName are set, the application is hidden as long as &quot;Show Updates&quot; is unchecked in the Add/Remove dialog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">6th November 2005, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">With regards to EstimatedSize, could you review the following Talk: page ?<br />
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Talk:Add_uninstall_information_to_Add/Remove_Programs<br />
<br />
by the way, typo in the descriptions: &quot;whitch&quot; = &quot;which&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">7th November 2005, 04:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Next time, Animaether, start discussions in the forum, not in the wiki. You know the wiki is not good for the purpose of posting messages. I'll quote the question here and delete that talk page.<br />
<br />

[The &quot;Add uninstall information to Add/Remove Programs&quot; wiki page] unfortunately doesn't cover setting the application size for the Add/Remove programs dialog. This size is reported on the Add/Remove programs page and can be used to sort by size, for example. If not supplied, you may see such magical sizes as 500GB for a 2MB program.<br />
<br />
I found the following information:<br />
The first is to set the EstimatedSize key to a hex value representing your application's size in bytes;<br />
WriteRegDWORD ROOT_KEY &quot;UNINSTKEY&quot; &quot;EstimatedSize&quot; 0x002625A0 ; 2.5MB in hex<br />
<br />
However, from the page I got it from, it becomes clear that Windows may just pick a size willy-nilly due to it 'finding' your application elsewhere (i.e. not your application!)<br />

<br />
This is partially due to the A(dd) R(emove) P(rograms) cache.<br />
So the second is that ARP cache information should be written to as well :<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=128462&amp;highlight=estimatedsize<br />
<br />
However, from that thread it is evident that you need a plugin and some pretty nasty manual coding to get it to work - assuming it works at all as the thread doesn't say.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on handling this properly ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">7th November 2005, 04:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I added it there because...<br />
1. I was new here %)<br />
and<br />
2. Typically, that's what a wiki's Discussion/Talk page is for - discussing that particular wiki page ;)<br />
also<br />
3. There didn't appear to -be- any thread on these forums dealing with add/remove programs information as far as displaying the size of the installation goes :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the move, though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
is this going to be included in the official docs, or should i rather create a wiki page?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">8th November 2005, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please attach that as a patch to Docs\src\usefulinfos.but?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">8th November 2005, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">2. Typically, that's what a wiki's Discussion/Talk page is for - discussing that particular wiki pageWell, ok. Maybe I should have left that page intact then. But people don't usually watch the recent changes page in the wiki. Also, wiki is too poor when organizing who posted what, even when you put your name: anyone could edit someone else's question, which is not good at all, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Maybe a rating system should be set up in the future so that people wouldn't have their comments edited by someone else, except by a sysop user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stb</div><div class="date">10th November 2005, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the &quot;new&quot; keys:<br />
<br />
Are these Microsoft keys? I mean, are they used (maybe in future) by Windows? I did some research myself some time ago and added a few more info than could be found in MSDN to the Uninstall section. But many installers add there own keys, and this is what I want to avoid.<br />
<br />
So what about RepairPath, Version*, ProductID and Reg*?<br />
<br />
And: InstallSource and Language seem to be used by Microsoft and many others, but are they evaluated by something else than Uninstallers?<br />
<br />
And: QuietUninstallString may be useful, too.</div></div><hr />
