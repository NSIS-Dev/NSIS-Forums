I'm looking forward to see Unicode support in the &quot;official&quot; NSIS release!<br />
<br />
Didn't know that we'll be able to enable Unicode support with a single attribute until now, that's cool :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrO</div><div class="date">10th December 2010, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">i think it is more that at the moment the manual only is being taken directly from cvs or something like that (not normally an issue though with how long it is taking to get a new version finished i guess it's become more apparent though i might be wrong on that, heh).<br />

Just my company's legal department. That is why some of us have been desperately waiting for an official, included Unicode release.</div></div><hr />
