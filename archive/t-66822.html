<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjw62</div><div class="date">30th November 2001, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, it would be possible, but it would require quite a few changes to the way the icon resources are updated in the exeheader. To be honest I think it is more trouble than it is worth .. what would be more useful would be a generic resource modifier that could be used from a command line interface in place of the exe packer.. hmm.. that sounds like a good idea.. then people could update dialogs and things..</div></div><hr />

kewl, that was the something I didn't like bout NSIS... didn't know there was such a simple work around...<br />
<br />
All you have to do:<br />
<br />
1. Go inside the source/exehead folder and replace nsis.ico with yer own full color icon that uses the same name.<br />
<br />
2. Right click on the new nsis.ico file. go to properties. Take the size in bytes and paste it into this line in exehead.h:<br />
<br />
int new_size = &lt;the size of the new icon in bytes&gt;;<br />
//extern unsigned char icon_data[766];<br />
extern unsigned char icon_data[new_size];<br />
<br />
Thanks a LOT Justin!!!</div></div><hr />
