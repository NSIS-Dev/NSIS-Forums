<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swapan Das</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">My installer built with the help of NSIS and with the help of this forum community is running fine but there is one hitch which I want to remove it. I make my installation folder a shared one from my installer. Sometimes it requires<br />
the user to press F5 to refresh the screen after installation is complete to view the Installation folder as<br />
shared one. How can I issue this F5 command automatically from my installer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The ${RefreshShellIcons} function included with NSIS as the FileFunc.nsh should do the trick.<br />
<br />
For usage instructions, look in your NSIS help files for:<br />
E.1.21 RefreshShellIcons</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry for such belated thanks! Actually I've been to some other projects and training and didn't had the time to look into NSIS forum.</div></div><hr />
