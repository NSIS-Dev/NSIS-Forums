<br />
I know there is the installation monitor program from Microsoft which does work but I would like to find a way to have NSIS do that work for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Take a snapshot of the system before start the 3rd party installation, take a snapshot right after the installation is finished, compare them, get all system changes e.g. registry added/modified/deleted keys, extracted files, started/stopped services etc, and build an installation script based on this comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. I have one already, the Microsoft Installation Monitor. I was asking if NSIS has this feature built-in. <br />
<br />
I've been using the WISE Install System and it has a feature to capture a program as it installs and then builds a generic install based on the capture.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Probably you should add a feature request.<br />
