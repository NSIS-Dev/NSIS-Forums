<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mkfish</div><div class="date">23rd June 2004, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, i play an MMORPG called eve-online(.com) and recently it was patch day, so i try to patch the game and i got an error message about an incorrect checksum, ok i thought ill just un-install and try again, however things wernt as simple as i had hoped, i got a message saying that the installer was corrupt for some reason (i posted a screenshot) so i deleted the eve directory and tryed to re-install the game, but got the same message, so im getting quite upset by this time that my ££ is going down the drain because i cant get online to play. i checked out the cd that i have the install file on and it works fine on my friends comp, so i know the problem lies with my computer, i have checked adware, viruses and i have scanned my hard drive for bad sectors etc. but i still get the same error message. this error message comes up now on any program by nullsoft or anything that uses the NSIS scripting. i also tried running the installer with the /NCRC command line however the install stops half way through which doesn't help much either<br />
<br />
if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
regards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">23rd June 2004, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps the installer attempts to reference the current one via the registry, where pieces might exist, therefore, causing it to fail. <br />
<br />
Try running the filemon utility at System Internals (http://www.sysinternals.com) and see what is happening directly before the crash.</div></div><hr />

They probably have a problem with their web servers or their connection. They might have also uploaded a corrupted version. Try contacting EvE's publisher.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th June 2004, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Try testing the installer downloaded on your computer on another computer. Just make sure it is an updated anti-virus first.<br />
<br />
BTW, the fact that it downloads fine on other computers doesn't rule out a bad connection either on your side or somewhere nearer to EvE which would affect other users. As said, you're not the first one to fail with EvE this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th June 2004, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Also try disabling download managers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mkfish</div><div class="date">24th June 2004, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">no no what i mean is, the file that i have, the one i downloaded an put on disk works on other computers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">24th June 2004, 22:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that doesn't sound like a virus then... What NSIS checks is if the file was modified, and if it's modified it's highly unlikely it'll be &quot;unmodified&quot; before it moves to another computer. Usually virii are meant to spread, they won't remove themselves before moved to another computer.<br />
<br />
However, the only case where /NCRC really removes the message is when the CRC check fails. You said that with /NCRC it starts but stops in the middle. That means something goes wrong when it's reading the file. However, copying it to another computer involves reading it...<br />
<br />
Do all other installers stop in the middle when the /NCRC flag is used? What about the NSIS installer (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nsis/nsis20.exe?download)?<br />
<br />
If it all started with checksum error on the patcher, maybe it has something to do with it? Maybe it's a new program you've just installed? I see you're using XP, is it by any chance SP2 beta? Maybe it's some problem with the SP2 beta... Something must be interrupting it when reading the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mkfish</div><div class="date">27th June 2004, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">im on using xp home SP1, i haven't installed anything recently apart from ad-aware. the eve installer cannot be copied from my disk to my computer, i don't have access to another computer at the time to test if it will copy to another HDD but what i did manage to test was that the NSIS error doesn't appear using a differnt machine when running the installer from the disk. i had 2 versions of the eve installer, and when using the /NCRC command they stopped at differnt files during the extraction process, the original file that i downloaded stops a lot further into the install than the current one i have (the cd that was downloaded on a differnt machine) i can install NSIS fine, no problems, but still get the same error trying to install EvE client</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have asked Dave to try and take a look, if he has the time. If nothing comes up by next weekend I'll try to write some tests so we can see what's going on.<br />
<br />
I'll understand if you'd want to get it over with and reinstall Windows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mentioned that you have downloaded the EvE installer and you also have one on CD (from a different PC).<br />
<br />
When you said the installer works fine on another PC did you mean the one on the CD or the one you downloaded? If you meant the one on the CD then kichik's last comment (&quot;That means something goes wrong when it's reading the file. However, copying it to another computer involves reading it...&quot;) does not apply.<br />
<br />
If so then I would agree that it's simply a fault with your PC. :(<br />
<br />
When you run one installer with /NCRC multiple times, does it stop at the same point every time? If not then that suggests the fault is with your hardware, and reinstalling Windows will not help. :(<br />
<br />
If after the above it still seems like a software problem; like zimsms said, try downloading and running the FileMon utility from SysInternals (http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/filemon.shtml) before running the installer (NB: you will need to be logged in with admin privileges). Press the Filter button (or Ctrl+L) and type in the name of the installer .exe in the Include box and see if the log shows up any errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mkfish</div><div class="date">4th July 2004, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">when i tried re-installing the eve client multiple times it stopped at the same time, i haven't tested other programs though. and i meant the one that was on the CD, it doesn't really matter to me anymore as i have a new pc, but it would be helpful for others if we could work it out, i wont format the old comp until we are finished with this so i can test stuff on it. i tested the filemon utility and no errors came up while running the installer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eccles</div><div class="date">4th July 2004, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, final questions (possibly :)):<br />
<br />
Just to confirm that the installer on the CD fails on your old PC, or just the one you downloaded? If so then I'm fairly sure one of memory/CPU/mainboard is at fault (over-clocked?) and the HD is probably OK.<br />
<br />

I just wanted to say that I am having the exact same problem as Mkfish has described. Eve client will not install, I get the same error message...I posted in the EVE forums and MKfish gave me a link to this thread....HELP!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mkfish</div><div class="date">15th July 2004, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">you tried other nsis related installers like winamp or nsis dev kit??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoebomber</div><div class="date">7th April 2005, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, Im getting the exact same problem, did anyone actually find an answer to this?? I know im responding to an old thread but i really really really do need some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redlazer</div><div class="date">13th May 2007, 22:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Its worth noting that i have the same problem.<br />
<br />
I've done some digging around, and i think the processor is to blame. Maybe the EVE client is sensitive - i dont know. Download Prime95 and see if the &quot;Bled&quot; test under Torture Test fails - if so, then you probably have a RAM or CPU issue. I downloaded the trial version of EVE and im having the same problem, and the /NCRC check fails every time. Ive downloaded and tested the installer on my laptop (which uses Vista, no less) and there where no issues, so the installer is fine.<br />
<br />
Its annoying that i cant force it to skip the check altogether - using the switch doesn't make a difference. <br />
<br />
As always, help is appreciated, but it doesnt seem like theres an easy way around this. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redlazer</div><div class="date">13th May 2007, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, i just tried the NSIS installer and it worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
Ok, now im confused.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">13th May 2007, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">If a memory test fails, an installer failure is the least of your problems. If even /NCRC fails and the same installer works elsewhere you probably have disk or memory failure. Memory corruption can lead to random crashes or BSODs. Disk failure can lead to data loss, even a complete loss of all of the data on the disk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pidelta434</div><div class="date">16th May 2008, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm reviving this thing once again.  I have downloaded the premium client twice now and I keep getting the NSIS message mentioned above.  I'm having to use a desktop to download the client as my laptop will not connect to the internet via wireless nor my ethernet. <br />
Laptop specs:<br />
HP Pavillion dv9000<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit<br />
Intel Core 2 Duo 2.20 GHz<br />
2046 MB RAM<br />
<br />
I also tried to run the sysinternals process monitor as was suggested, but I keep getting an error of &quot;Out of Memory&quot;.  What kind of problem does this sound like? My computer's hardware or Vista.  I'm also thinking of reverting back to XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">16th May 2008, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">You should contact EvE for support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fishweasel</div><div class="date">22nd May 2008, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not sure CCP still use NSIS for their installations. However i have noticed on some of my installers that if i try to run it a second time from the cd (or same location)i get a crc fail. Try copying the file to a different location and run it again. Failing that download the classic and auto patch it.<br />
<br />
Other issues could include the eve cache folder in Documents and settings - if all else fails check eve-o forums as you would more likely find others have had this issue since premium release.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XxXGoD</div><div class="date">22nd May 2008, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">It could just be a corrupt download, turn firewall off and anti virus off and re-download the update patch.<br />
<br />
Should work.<br />

- Remember to turn em back on after instal :D</div></div><hr />
