<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Datamonkey</div><div class="date">30th January 2012, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I am creating an installer that I can give the users the option of installing to the hard drive or installing some shortcuts (desk top or start menu) that point to the CD/USB drive and access the files there.<br />
<br />
Basically we have some documentation that our field reps use (html/PDFs) but they don’t always want to load the entire document library on their machines due to several reasons.<br />
I got an NSIS installer that will install the different libraries. It has an options for the field rep to pick at least one library to all of them. <br />
<br />
After they pick which library(s) they want to install, I would like to give them the option to install the chosen libraries to their computer HDD or install a desktop/start menu icon that points to the CD/USB drive and reads the files off that.<br />
<br />
Is this possible and if so how?<br />
<br />
I am stumped because I believe I will need the files readable like if I was browsing a CD but the installer I currently use has them all compressed into the .exe file. With a CD I will not be able to “expand” them and install them on the CD. <br />
<br />
Is there anything else I should conceder?<br />
<br />
Thanx inadvance...</div></div><hr />
