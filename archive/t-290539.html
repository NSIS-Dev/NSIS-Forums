<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlrotor</div><div class="date">20th April 2008, 06:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I just installed NSIS 2.36.<br />
I let it do an &quot;uninstall&quot; of the old NSIS.<br />
<br />
My script with MUI was working fine.<br />
Now I get errors in English.nsh<br />
I changed !include mui.nsh to mui2.nsh, but I'm still getting errors in english.nsh.<br />
<br />
I hope I am just missing something simple.<br />
<br />
I confess I don't know what version of NSIS I was using before 2.36.  What was the last version that does NOT have MUI2 in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JHaigh</div><div class="date">20th April 2008, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Try adding the line<br />
<br />
MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot;<br />
<br />
or something like that AFTER the page definitions, I think, I had to do this last week, but the examples are on another PC at the moment.<br />
<br />
so it should be something along the lines...<br />
<br />
MUI_START_PAGE<br />
MUI_LICENSE_PAGE<br />
MUI_INSTFILES_PAGE<br />
<br />
MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot;<br />
<br />
It's all in the MUI2 help page anyhow...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlrotor</div><div class="date">20th April 2008, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip.  I will try adding this line:<br />
!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;English&quot;<br />
<br />
The stuff about this line is in the documentation for both MUI and MUI2.  However, my original script did not have that line, and it worked.  It did have the following line:<br />
!include &quot;English.nsh&quot;.  I previously found that to get my script working, I had to put English.nsh in my project folder.  That must have been because I did not have insertmacro line.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I had printed the previous NSIS.CHM to a pdf file and I still had that file (better for searches than the chm).  This file told me I was using 2.28.  I have uninstalled 2.36 and reinstalled 2.28.  Oddly enough, a PassWord plugin I am using disappeared somewhere along the way.<br />
<br />
I have put the password plugin dll back in the plugins folder, and my script is working again :)<br />
<br />
I'm going to install 2.36 to it's own folder, and try it again.  I think HM NIS allows me to tell it which NSIS compiler to use.<br />
<br />
I just finished doing the above.  My script seems to be working fine with 2.36. :):)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JHaigh</div><div class="date">20th April 2008, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I did a script on thursday/friday using HM NIS to see how it worked, but when I tried to compile it in NSIS 2.36 I ran into the same problems, just took a bit of fiddling about and making sure everything is in the right place to do it manually, (since I mainly use UltraEdit with the NSIS highlighting). Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with using HM NIS either, but I'm trying to learn the tool (only been a week) so I figured that doing it from the ground up armed only with the help, some examples, the forum and a fairly clear idea of what I wanted was probably the best way. I'll have to look into how to setup HM NIS properly as well then now ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlrotor</div><div class="date">21st April 2008, 02:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a long time user of Ultraedit, and I like it a lot.  <br />
<br />
I used the HM NIS wizard to jump start my script, and I've stayed with it since I first started using NSIS in June-07.  I find it a useful IDE for NSIS since it integrates with the help file, and can take me right to lines with syntax errors.<br />
<br />
My script does almost everything I want it to do.  I need to study the MUI documentation some more to fix one little thing with default start menu folder.<br />
