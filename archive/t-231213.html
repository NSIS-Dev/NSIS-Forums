<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cappy2112</div><div class="date">17th November 2005, 02:39</div></div><div class="posttext">After taking example1.nsi and attempting to make it work for my target application, NSIS prompted me with the Install Dir path that I had entered into the InstallDir variable.<br />
<br />
I don't want the user to be able to change the path, only the drive to which the application is installed.<br />
<br />
1. Where can I find an example to prevent NSIS from prompting<br />
 the user to change the installation path?<br />
2. Where can I find an example that lets the use change the target destination drive ONLY?<br />
<br />
I didn't see anything that would do what I need in the examples directory<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

If you're using Modern UI you just don't need the !insertmacro MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY in your code.<br />
<br />
As for selecting a drive to install to, your best bet is to make an InstallOptions dialog. See InstallOptions examples in Examples\InstallOptions, Examples\Modern UI\InstallOptions.nsi and the readme under Docs\InstallOptions.<br />
<br />
There should be some functions or a plugin on the Wiki to get a list of hard drives on the computer.<br />
Check http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Developer_Center<br />

Thanks for replying<br />

I'm not doing this at all. I'm merely used the example1.nsi in the examples directory, and set<br />
<br />
INSTALLDIR = &quot;C:\MyPath&quot;<br />
<br />
and I was prompted with a dialogue box to browse to e new path or type it in by hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dandaman32</div><div class="date">18th November 2005, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Use the NSIS page command.<br />
<br />
Page license<br />
Page components<br />
Page Instfiles<br />
<br />
Normally there would be a &quot;Page directory&quot; in between components and instfiles, but you can leave it out to omit the directory page.<br />
<br />
Will try to write an InstallOptions page in the next few minutes here...<br />

I see. I 've removed the Page Directory, not it doesn't prompt the user.<br />
<br />
This program is really a bear to figure out.<br />
I'm starting to think that Install Shield is a better way to go.</div></div><hr />
