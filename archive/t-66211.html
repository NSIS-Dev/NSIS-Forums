<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TicTac</div><div class="date">20th November 2001, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">i would like to see something along the lines that Create services for NT boxes. i would also want something that start/stop services when installing programs that might interfere with the service. (installing apache over a phptriad application for example)<br />
<br />
if you could somehow get these working, i bet alot more people would be happier.... at least youll have one.. me :)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

...<br />

<br />
Sounds nice, but ...<br />
perhaps this does not belong to an installer but to the executable which implements the service. When creating services, there are so much parameters which need to be correctly specified. The programmer of the service executable should know best about what parameters to use.<br />
A good example for that is inetd from the cygwin dist. It has two commandline options --install-as-service and --remove-as-service which (un)registers itself.<br />
For start/stop you are probably right.<br />

<br />
For all services which I've written, I've always built the ability to register and unregister themselves into the application.  Adds very little overhead and what better place to put it.</div></div><hr />

Have a look at the attached code. This is the cygwin inetd. You can<br />
get the full package (inetutils) from one of the mirrors listed here (http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html).<br />
