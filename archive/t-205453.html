<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">c567591</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I know I am being a dumbass, but I can't get a Delphi dll that I am writing to work.<br />
<br />
The delphi function call is:<br />
function GetProductInt(SerialNo, Key:String): Integer; cdecl;<br />
<br />
Using the System plugin:<br />
SYSTEM::Call 'Project1::GetProductInt(t, t)i  (r0, r1) r2'<br />
$R0 and $R1 have the text strings that I am trying to pass to the function, so that looks ok.<br />
<br />
As soon as I call it, I get an error from XP saying it has caused and error and now needs to close.  I don't think it is doing anything in my function yet.  i have tried to write the SerialNo and Key to a file in my Delphi function to check them and I tried outputting them via message box and still I cant get anywhere.<br />
<br />
I looked at the example plugin and I did not understand what I was supposed to pass to the EXDll example plugin to do this as a plugin.  What do I put in the nsis script to call the example plugin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Your System::Call line is missing a dot before 'r2'. But that's not why it crashes. It might have crashed because you're using the wrong calling convention. You need to use stdcall, not cdecl.<br />
<br />
To use a plug-in, put the DLL in the Plugins folder, and use it just like you use the System plug-in:PluginName::FunctionName parameter1 &quot;parameter 2&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">c567591</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I will try that an report back what happens.<br />
<br />
As far as a plugin version goes, there is no initialization that needs to occur or anything?  Or does nsis handle that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Initialization of what? The ExDLL.pas example shows everything that needs to be done on the plug-in side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">c567591</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">How do I call it from the nsis script?<br />
<br />
EXDLL::ex_dll<br />
How do I get hwndParent: HWND parameter to send it?<br />
<br />
procedure ex_dll(const hwndParent: HWND; const string_size: integer; const variables: PChar; const stacktop: pointer); cdecl;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">All of those parameters are passed by NSIS. In your script, the bare minimum is:ExDLL::ex_dllIf you wish to send some stack parameters, add them on the same line, just like with the System plug-in call.</div></div><hr />
