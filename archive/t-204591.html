<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shpati86</div><div class="date">11th January 2005, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so this is the story - i have downloaded some programm and i go to install it when it goes there may be a virus blah blah the installer may be corrupt blah blah (none of these is true the comp is clean and i installed the same thing on another comp no problem). <br />
     So then it says if u want to you can bypass this whole thing by using the /NCRC command line switch. which i thought fair enough ill do that then. But ive searched every forum on the net with similar problems posted and for the love of god no one tells u (or as far as i am aware knows) how to do this command line switch. <br />
   Now id love if one of you people out there with this knowlege floating around can enlighten me coz its bugging me real hard!!!! Thank you<br />

If it's a lot of programs, a bad internet connection.<br />
<br />
To use /NCRC, which is not recommended, click Start, choose Run, type the path to the installer (in quotes), add /NCRC and hit enter. For example, if the installer is in C:\My Downloads\Games\CatchMe.exe, type:&quot;C:\My Downloads\Games\CatchMe.exe&quot; /NCRC</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scapegoat_1</div><div class="date">18th April 2006, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I try this, and it finally bypasses the error i usually gets and starts to install, then i get another error that says &quot;Error Decompressing Data! Corrupted Installer?&quot; and installs no more. <br />
I've downloaded the program from 2 different locations and get the same result, is it a problem with my connection maybe? or is the installer actually corrupted, if so, where do i download it to reinstall?? <br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gendee</div><div class="date">3rd December 2006, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - you guys are way ahead of me.  I'm not sure what program is causing the error.  I had recently downloaded and installed a free download manager which I didn't like and promptly uninstalled.  I don't think the error message started showing up right then though.  I guess I'm just not getting the whole idea for some reason.  Did I (or someone else on my computer) try to download a program and the installer for that specific program had problems thus the annoying message every time I close IE?  Or is it a program I already have on the computer that is causing the problem.  I have updated and scanned for viruses and malware - nothing!  I guess it's not hurting anything, but it really makes me crazy when I can't get rid of the stupid message!  Help please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kichik</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You have a malware on your computer trying to run every time you close Internet Explorer. That malware, or part of it, must have gotten corrupt somehow. It is also probably packaged with NSIS. You should seek help on anti-malware forum on how to remove this pest from your computer. You'll probably be asked to provide Hijack This log or a log of a similar problem that'd be analyzed and lead to the pest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Termin8or</div><div class="date">17th August 2008, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">ok,i pressed start,then run,then i wrote the path:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">17th August 2008, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;C:\Program Files\CrazyKart20080617.exe&quot; /NCRC<br />
You look like you used the wrong slashes and left out the space in Program Files. It also looks like you left out a subfolder name, but maybe CrazyKart20080617.exe is directly under Program Files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Termin8or</div><div class="date">17th August 2008, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for helping,i already fixed it in a other way (downloaded from other resource:D ) but thanks anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faceson</div><div class="date">12th June 2009, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Just stumbled across this thread as I also had these error boxes come up and went for the route of using /NCRC command line switch to get round the problem. I also just ended up downloading from another resource. I think there are a couple of corrupted files about the internet and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s causing these errors to appear when starting the program. If anyone else is getting the same thing I would just recommend in searching for another site to download it from</div></div><hr />
