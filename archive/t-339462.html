<br />
I have my command line options working for my installer, which involves the NotifyIcon plugin. Because of that plugin, I can't run my installer on silent through the command line. It has 1 custom page (both page and leave) and MUI finish page. I came up with two issues, so if anyone can help, please!<br />
<br />
1 - Am using MUI, so I know I have to use a separate function and then !define MUI_CUSTOMFUNCTION_GUIINIT myGuiInit. I load this code into:<br />
Function MyGUIInit<br />
  NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD &quot;yitbx&quot; 103 &quot;Update Manager&quot; &quot;Update Manager&quot; &quot;Loading...&quot;<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
But the icon disappears on me in the tray when I hover over the icon. I read this was an issue before, which is why you should put the code in a custom function as above, but I have no idea why the icon still is not loading. I've also tried to force include the icon (&quot;fitbx&quot; 103 &quot;icon.ico&quot;), but that has the same issue.<br />
<br />
2. - Running the installer minimized. I've tried including &quot;HideWindow&quot; in .onInit and myGuiInit, made my own functions, and anywhere else I could think of, but that's not working at all either. Including it as a !define MUI_PAGE_CUSTOMFUNCTION_PRE, that did not work.</div></div><hr />
