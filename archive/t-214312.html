<br />
I have tried 2.06, and cannot get the exclude to work.  What we want to do, is have a single file command with a wildcard to recursivly add everything, and overwrite ALL files, except a single file, where we want to leave it, if it's ready present.<br />
<br />
The snippet of code that does not seem to be working is:<br />
<br />
SetOverwrite try  <br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
File /nonfatal /r /x &quot;DeployFolder\Dont_overwrite_me.pdf&quot; &quot;DeployFolder\*.*&quot; <br />
	<br />
SetOverwrite off<br />
File /nonfatal &quot;DeployFolder\Dont_overwrite_me.pdf&quot;  <br />
SetOverwrite try</div></div><hr />

File /nonfatal /r /x &quot;Dont_overwrite_me.pdf&quot; &quot;DeployFolder\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
I think /x only works for file names not full paths.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richiebabes</div><div class="date">4th July 2008, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">What if I have a folder with other subfolders and want to exclude certain files within those subfolders. E.g. let's say I have folder a which contains folders b, c and d. In b, c and d I want to exclude any .tmp files. Also in b, c and d there are files of the same name - bob.txt. But I only want to exclude bob.txt from the c folder. How would I code that? Would I be able to do it in one line or would I have to break it up?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you would have to do it manually:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\a\b&quot;<br />
File &quot;a\b\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\a\c&quot;<br />
File /x bob.txt &quot;a\c\*.*&quot;<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR\a\d&quot;<br />
File &quot;a\d\*.*&quot;</div></div><hr />
