<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DeJe</div><div class="date">13th June 2004, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I am comming from Installshield. I used it for a multilanguage PocketPC application. But InstallShield EXE are rather big, installation for PocketPC isn't flexible (no way to modify INF files), ...<br />
<br />
So I downloaded NSIS and the HM NIS editor yesterday to get an idea how it would work for me. Well, have to say I am pretty much impressed how &quot;easy&quot; it is. :up:<br />
My setup with NSIS is up and running allready (EXE is half the size of IS with nearly same functionality). :D<br />
<br />
There is just one issue left. Is there a default page/text for an upgrade warning, so warn the user that the program is allready installed? Most important for sure is the multilanguage functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">13th June 2004, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">this is an example i've used in one of my scripts. it checks if nsis is installed on the system, unselects the component if it is and displays a messagebox if one wants to install it anyway.<br />
<br />
please note that i used the .chm file to make sure it's a NSIS 2.0 installation. it's safer and more elegant to query the registry for existing installation keys, but in this case that wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
also this might not be the perfect example, but it should be enough to figure out how it works. if you prefer a custom page over a messagebox, search the forum for custom pages.<br />

for the multilingual installation, check the languages example (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Examples/languages.nsi), which comes with your nsis installation.</div></div><hr />

May I wasn't clear anough. The code to check older installations and tell the user I had allready but just english. I need the informational text for different languages. So I was hoping there is a page handling this with no need for me to translate to every needed language. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deguix</div><div class="date">14th June 2004, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use LangString to translate messages depending on the computer language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DeJe</div><div class="date">14th June 2004, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yes that helped.<br />
Unfortunately there is an issue with language selection. If I change language during .onInit it isn't accepted within .onInit. It's changed not until the first install section. But I want to have the upgrade/update agreement dialog at very first, not walking all the installation pages.<br />
I know the language (if prevously installed) from &quot;NSIS:Language&quot; even at .onInit, so that's not the issue. To point is, I do want to use the language the user had choosen, not the language NSIS chooses at startup. ;)<br />
Any solution to that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zimsms</div><div class="date">14th June 2004, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a look at my example (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=181480). It demonstrates a completely functional multilingual install, containing the functionality you are requesting.</div></div><hr />

You can use the LangDLL plugin. If you're using Modern UI, it's easy to implement that in your installer:<br />
<br />
;--------------------------------<br />
;Reserve Files<br />
  <br />
  ;These files should be inserted before other files in the data block<br />
  ;Keep these lines before any File command<br />
  ;Only for solid compression (by default, solid compression is enabled for BZIP2 and LZMA<br />
<br />
!insertmacro MUI_RESERVEFILE_LANGDLL<br />
<br />
Function .onInit<br />
<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_LANGDLL_DISPLAY ;call LangDLL plugin<br />
<br />
FunctionEnd<br />
<br />
;--------------------------------<br />
;Uninstaller Functions<br />
<br />
; Use this if your installer has an uninstaller<br />
<br />
Function un.onInit<br />
<br />
  !insertmacro MUI_UNGETLANGUAGE<br />
  <br />
FunctionEnd</div></div><hr />
