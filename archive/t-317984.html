<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SR1</div><div class="date">25th March 2010, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
NSIS newbie here. I've been given a script that supports English and Spanish and asked to add Arabic to it. <br />
<br />
I inserted this line<br />
     !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE &quot;Arabic&quot;<br />
<br />
and added Arabic strings to this section<br />
LangString FAIL ${LANG_ENGLISH} &quot;FAILED&quot;<br />
LangString PRODUCT_NAME ${LANG_SPANISH} &quot;Product Name&quot;<br />
<br />
saved the NSI file as UTF-8, and found out the hard way that NSIS doesn't support Unicode script files. <br />
<br />
This script is using several plugins and I am not NSIS expert. I really really don't want to switch over to Unicode NSIS.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to add arabic strings to the installer script without switching over to Unicode NSIS? Maybe move them to a separate file saved with Arabic codepage?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
Sergey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pidgeot</div><div class="date">27th March 2010, 04:49</div></div><div class="posttext">You can store them with mixed code pages, but you won't be able to see both Arabic and Spanish at the same time - because their respective code pages simply don't contain all of the required characters (Arabic contains no Spanish accented letters, and the Western European code page doesn't contain any Arabic).<br />
<br />
If you try to display text in the wrong code page, you'll get mojibake (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake). That's probably going to be a problem - because at the very least, you probably need to show both for a language selection dialog.<br />
<br />
I really think you should switch to Unicode NSIS now. You'll get a much better result out of it, and unless you stop updating NSIS entirely, you're going to have to do it eventually anyway, because as far as I can tell, they're actually integrating the Unicode changes now - so it looks like we may have seen the last ANSI release.<br />
<br />
If you're concerned about plugins, then you could post which plugins you are using, and it'd be possible to see where you might experience problems.</div></div><hr />
