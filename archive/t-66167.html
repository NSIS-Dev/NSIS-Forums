I could do it in the intall sections screen or force it when WA3 is installed but what im looking for is the option to install the skin after the fact that the user has chosen to install WA3. I was thinking about ReadINIStr and the install opitions window and creating a variable some how but i think that it is a little over my head. a bit of code would help a lot. Some suggestions would help too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i created something similar. I let the user choose whether or not to install a tool and then let them choose (given they choose the tool) to adust the path of some program the tool is intended for. What I did (sorry, at this computer no code available...):<br />
<br />
-reate an ini file with every option if full install is choosen.<br />
-at run-time detect (IfFileExists) whether or not certain components have been installed.<br />
-adjust the ini to this info with DeleteIniStr.<br />
-remember to change the number of fields in the settings section of the ini.<br />
-and then run the exe and ini.<br />
-if a result is an empty string then apparently, the option was not available at run-time (but you can again check this with IfFileExists).<br />
<br />
Still troubled???<br />
<br />
Good luck, Hendri - :D Smile2Me :D -</div></div><hr />
