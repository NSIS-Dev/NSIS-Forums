I read few months ago that Justin didn't have a clear idea of where to go with it, and then I see various &quot;2&quot; versions. Is v1.98 the &quot;final&quot; version and now everyone can do what he wants?<br />
<br />
I know that because we have the source we can do whatever we want with it, But is there a plan for the future?<br />
<br />
:confused:Thanks for answering because I don't know where I am:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunjammer</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">1.98 is the last stable release by Justin.<br />
2.0a0 is the last alpha release by Justin.<br />
These can be found on the official NSIS page at Nullsoft (http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis).<br />
<br />
1.99 is a modification by forum user KiCHiK.<br />
2.0a1 is a modification by forum user Rainwater.<br />
2.0a2 is the combination of 1.99 and 2.a01 plus some additional features, by KiCHiK.<br />
<br />
The 1.99 mod is hosted on my archive here (http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/Nsis199).<br />
<br />
I have a page for NSIS 2.0a0 on my archive here (http://www.clantpa.co.uk/nsis/wiki/index.php/Nsis20a1) and the file available for download but that is not it's official home, I'd have to dig through the archives of this forum to find where Rainwater made it available to work that out.<br />
<br />
The 2.0a2 mod has it's own area on Source Forge here (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis2k/).<br />
<br />
Last I heard Justin was going to be away for a while, so the official position on NSIS I guess is that it's sleeping for now, bar user developments.</div></div><hr />
