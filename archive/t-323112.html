If you specify the filename in the nsDialogs::SelectFileDialog call, it'll pre-select that file in the prompt area.. but the 'explorer view' won't have it selected / scrolled into view.  Not sure what you'd need that for unless the user can optionally open the file you'd pre-select but is statistically likely to actually want to open a file that is visually (in the explorer view) close to the one you pre-selected.<br />
<br />
off-topic.. you can highlight the explorer view part, start typing the name of a file of interest, and it'll scroll right to that file - no need to scroll through manually :)</div></div><hr />

i don't need to open a file, i just want to find it for a user. it's not important though, thought there's a simple way to do this as it's already possible in nsDialogs. maybe i can figure out a different approach.<br />

yes, of course. but tell them ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Animaether</div><div class="date">13th October 2010, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm curious why you're trying to 'find a file for a user' if you already know what it's called and you're not actually using it to open the file or anything.<br />
<br />
Unless you slap a name like VisualFileFinder on it and sell it for $2.99 in the App Store, that is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's because i'm abusing NSIS to create stuff (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/PimpBot) that doesn't install things :)<br />
<br />
here's a video (http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/pb4_preview.mov) of what i'm currently working on<br />
<br />
@afrowuk: thx</div></div><hr />

I wonder why there's a delay in your UI drawing when you change the paths.. we've got pretty much the same thing going on (green/orange/red depending on path validity).. perhaps LockWindow on/off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathosho</div><div class="date">13th October 2010, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">much better now, thanks for the suggestion</div></div><hr />
