<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deuxchevaux</div><div class="date">11th June 2009, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm developing a program for which I need to install an USB Driver. I use DPInst using ExecWait to install the driver. The manufacturer provides a package with 3 driver types: x86, amd64 and ia64. DPInst also comes in these flavors as 3 seperate executables (from the Windows DDK, Driver Development Kit).<br />
<br />
What is the difference between amd64 and ia64 and how can I distuinguish these versions from NSIS?<br />
<br />
I saw the x64.nsh in the NSIS dir, but I do not see how I can use the functions to get the difference between amd64 and ia64.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
<br />

<br />
Unless you've been asked to support Itaniums, though, I'd say ignore ia64.  amd64 is what pretty much everybody uses now - Intel, I'm guessing, calls it something other than 'amd64' ('x86-64', I guess), but the architecture is the same.  Itanium is a completely different - and near-dead - beast pretty much only used in some server settings, still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanx for the help. Our product is geared towards the consumer market, so Itanium will be a very, very rare occasion.<br />
<br />
I've now built in x64 detection using x64.nsh and call the appropiate DPInst version from that.<br />
<br />
I just didn't know what ia64 exactly meant.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
