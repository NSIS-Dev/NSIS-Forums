<br />
      I had read the installer protection posted by redwine and seems to be very interesting. Could you please suggest me with any other suggestions to disable the installer after installing on user system?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

If I remember correctly this was simply a research started on this forum thread,<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=243180<br />
<br />
I've posted the result on wiki just for reference which might lead someone to a stealth solution,<br />

<br />
        I have some queries regarding the NSIS installer post by redwine. Could you please clarify my doubts regarding the code posted at wiki?<br />
<br />
        Can you explain the functionality of  Install.dat and decoder.dat files which holds the counter and MD5 Checksum values? If possible can redwine explain the functionality of the code in simpler way as i am newbie over here...<br />
<br />
Please help me out....<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I guess reviewing the script and Decrypt dll documentation would help you find the way.<br />
As I've already mentioned the script has not any interesting functionality, it is there for reference, perhaps you may find a way to improve it.</div></div><hr />

          Thanks for your reply..Could you please teach me how  we can disable the installer after n times as i cant see any relevant code in the post. <br />
<br />

I'll try again... I don't remember and I'm unable to start over, aside the fact that it is incomplete thus you would not like to involve it in a real world installer.<br />
It is there for reference, I'd say as a prove that NSIS is unique.</div></div><hr />
