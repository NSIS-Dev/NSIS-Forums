<br />
as you may know MinGW shell under WIN32 mounts stuff in the way that you get a Linux style directory layout, i.e. /home/someuser and so on.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to make makensis.exe work with these directories? It seems that makensis always looks for absolute windows style paths, i.e. c:\mingw\msys\1.0\home\someuser<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason why I am asking:<br />
<br />
I have a project that compiles under MinGW, the configure script processes my nsi file automatically and inserts package version, location of compiled binaries that should go into the installer and so on.<br />
<br />
However, since the build system runs within the MinGW environment, all paths are &quot;local&quot; MinGW paths, i.e. /home/someuser and so on.<br />
<br />
My goal was to integrate makensis.exe into the build so that I'd simply run &quot;make installer&quot; to get what I need. However, makensis refuses to work with those paths and insists on c:\xxx<br />
<br />
I even compiled nsis under MinGW, hoping that it would pick up the &quot;local&quot; layout, but that did not help.<br />
<br />
Using nsis-3.0a1<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Jin</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it would, however my problem is that I do not know the relative path to the installation directory in this scenario, I only have the absolute &quot;mingw&quot; version of the path.<br />
<br />
Right now I implmented a workaround where I would cd to the mingw path and issue a pwd -W which will return the windows path, and then use that to process the nsi. It works, however I'd be still interested to know if there is a way to make nsis use the mingw paths.</div></div><hr />
