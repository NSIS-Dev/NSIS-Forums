<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlakeW</div><div class="date">18th September 2012, 04:45</div></div><div class="posttext">When I try to create a short cut to a folder in my install directory, the installer is creating the shortcut, but when I look at the properties, it's of type &quot;File&quot; rather than type &quot;File Folder&quot;.  Selecting it from the Start Menu brings up a dialog asking which program should be used to open it rather than opening the folder in the Explorer.<br />
<br />
This is the line from my script:<br />
<br />
CreateShortCut '$SMPROGRAMS\My Program\logs.lnk' '$INSTDIR\logs'<br />
<br />
Creating a short cut to the program or the uninstaller is working fine.  I can also create a shortcut to any other directory (e.g. C:Program Files) and it gets created with the proper File Folder type and works fine.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that this has something to do with the fact that the $INSTDIR\logs directory is created as part of the install step, so is new and somehow CreateShortCut doesn't understand it's a directory.  Any suggestions for how to make this work?</div></div><hr />
