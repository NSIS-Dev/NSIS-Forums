<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PerditionC</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Below is a sample.  If I first copy the<br />
LangString message to $0 then I can use<br />
it with other text &quot;$0&quot;, &quot;abc$0&quot;, and<br />
&quot;$0abc&quot; but $(message) itself can not be combined.  Am I doing something wrong or is this simply not an option?  Admittedly its easy to get around but makes the code less clear.  Also you may want to emphasis in the docs to use parenthesis () and not curly braces {} as I didn't notice this until careful looking (the font my browser displayed the docs in makes it hard to see any difference).  :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtlink</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to find the error, but couldn't. By the way, the documentation doesn't say anything about when to use ${symbol} and when $(symbol). Sometimes it even generates a couple of errors more:<br />
warning: unknown variable &quot;{Message}&quot; detected, ignoring<br />
warning: unknown variable &quot;{Message)&quot; detected, ignoring<br />
warning: unknown variable &quot;(Message)&quot; detected, ignoring<br />
:eek: :eek: :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well for me, each section<br />
prints a message, with all 5 I get:<br />
English message<br />
hi$(Message)  &amp; a warning during compile<br />
hiEnglish message<br />
English message<br />
English messagehi<br />
<br />
the desired output is:<br />
English message<br />
hiEnglish message<br />
hiEnglish message<br />
English message<br />
English messagehi<br />
English messagehi<br />
<br />
As best I can tell, you use curly braces ${} for all defines, parenthesis $() for all LangStrings, and $val for predefined registers.  Any other use I've tried results in the unknown variable warning.<br />
With $val and ${} I can combine with literal text without the need for an explicit StrCpy, but when using $() I have to use a StrCpy and a temp variable.  That is one must StrCpy $0 $(message) and then StrCpy &quot;pre-text$0 post-text&quot;, and if one has another LangString to add, StrCpy $1 $(another_message) then StrCpy $0 &quot;$0$1&quot;<br />
because even StrCpy $0 &quot;$0$(another_message)&quot; will fail ...<br />
<br />
Note: I am using NSIS 2.0b0 if it makes a difference.</div></div><hr />

You can't include them in other strings. &quot;look at my $(string)! isn't it beautiful?&quot; will be seen exactly as written, $(string) will not be expended.<br />
<br />
I have added this a few days ago to the docs.<br />
<br />
I will make a note about the different braces.</div></div><hr />

A little typo there with the expansion, I will fix that too :)</div></div><hr />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />
