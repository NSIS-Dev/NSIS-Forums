<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berglind</div><div class="date">3rd December 2007, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using the games plugin to register with Games Explorer in Vista. It worked perfectly on my machine (Vista Business edition) but when it was tested on other machines, it fails on Home and Ultimate editions (but works on other Business edition machines). The reported error is that games.dll in a temp directory can not be loaded. The dll is there and I can't see anything wrong with it. For a while I thought maybe it had to be signed, but that doesn't change anything. Is it remotely possible that it's because it's built on Vista Business (I put some debugging code in and rebuilt)? Or what other possible reason could there be for this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use the non-dependent script:<br />

But my plan B is to use script instead of the plugin, thanks for the link.</div></div><hr />
