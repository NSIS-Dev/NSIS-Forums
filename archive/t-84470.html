<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">12th April 2002, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">:) Nice idea: a speech.<br />
<br />
Ahummm...<br />
<br />
I'm really glad to be choosen as the new moderator. I thank all people who supported me in achieving this goal. First of all of course all people of the NSIS Forum. Furthermore, I'd like to thanks my parents, the neighbours, my goldfish and of course my computer for not crashing too much lately.<br />
<br />
My plans for the future are just to try to answer as many questions as possible to help all of you out. I do not expect huge problems since you all have behaved real nice as long as I can remember.<br />
<br />
So just continue your work with NSIS as I will do. Please always first try to search the Forum, because your question could already have been answered. If not, just post the question and the answer will soon be posted. Furthermore, I really support the idea of the &quot;READ ME FIRST&quot; to tell the people who where so kind to answer to your problem if the solution worked.<br />
<br />
I think that's it.<br />
But the most important part: just have fun!!!<br />
<br />
Good luck everyone with NSIS,<br />
greetz from Holland,<br />

And as for us to behave (i'm agreeing with you Smile2Me). I have to say this. This is one of the best mannered forums, that I have ever participated with. One where moderation is rarely needed, but good to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">12th April 2002, 09:42</div></div><div class="posttext">me bows :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prodangle</div><div class="date">14th April 2002, 07:10</div></div><div class="posttext">congrats Smile2Me, it's very nice to see a super-active mod here, lets just hope you don't get too much work to do ;)<br />
now you've just got to think of something witty to put under your name, perhaps we should have a poll?  (Or should we just get back to work like eccles says :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smile2Me</div><div class="date">14th April 2002, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">My CT already has been &quot;Moderator&quot; but the ForumGods changed this because this would also give me rights on other forums (at Winamp)...<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter too much to me. You all know me and what I do (I hope :)).<br />
