<br />
after being able to solve our last topic by simply working around it, another problem arose (probably a quite easy one this time):<br />
<br />
Uninstall by Control Panel doesn't work on Windows Server 2008. When clicking &quot;Uninstall&quot; in the &quot;Programs and Features&quot; applet in the Control Panel, the following error message pops up:<br />
<br />
&quot;An error occured while trying to uninstall &quot;Our Application Package&quot;. It may already have been uninstalled. Would you like to remove blah.blah.blubb...?&quot; <br />
<br />
Is it possible to solve this issue by RTFM or would someone of you like to shortly gimme a hint? Please see the attached .nsi-File.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
<br />
Chris</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">demiller9</div><div class="date">16th April 2008, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The registry entry &quot;UninstallString&quot; has the executable name as 'uninstall.exe' and the WriteUninstaller instruction has it as '_uninstall.exe'.  That looks like enough to cause the error message it shows you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherdeg</div><div class="date">16th April 2008, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep...that did it...but I could swear I had changed this when I renamed unistall.exe to _uninstall.exe - I did it explicitly...hmmm...however...maybe...I got dumb.<br />
<br />
The only funny thing is that on XP the uninstaller works nevertheless...<br />
<br />
?!?<br />
<br />
No joke!</div></div><hr />
