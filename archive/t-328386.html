<br />
I'm in the process of trying to wrap an older project into an NSIS installer and am seeing a curious output.  I'm using Library.nsh to install / update all of my DLL's, EXE's and OCX's (YES - my project is 'that' old...)<br />
<br />
Everything in my installer seems to be working just fine...  Except, I'm seeing output from the updater that looks like:<br />
<br />
Registering: C:\Program Files\MyApp\work_11.ocx<br />
<br />
The curious thing about the above line is - work_11.ocx *didn't* change in the latest release.  The installer line looks like this:<br />
<br />
    !insertmacro InstallLib REGDLL NOTSHARED NOREBOOT_NOTPROTECTED &quot;${SRCFOLDER}\work_11.ocx&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR\work_11.ocx&quot; &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;<br />
<br />
I've looked in both the ${SRCFOLDER} and $INSTDIR and work_11.ocx is defined as:<br />
<br />
work_11.ocx     594 KB   ActiveX Control   3/15/2004<br />
<br />
So my question is...  If work_11.ocx *didn't* change in the release we are shipping, should Library.nsh perform any actions?  I had originally assumed that Library.nsh *wouldn't* do anything with my OCX, or DLL, if the underlying file hadn't changed.  Isn't registering my OCX or DLL again, even though nothing changed, a waste of time?  And displaying that it Registered my OCX is gonna confuse the developers who 'know' what files were updated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
