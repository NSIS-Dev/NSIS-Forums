<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lupo73</div><div class="date">19th March 2009, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I need, during the install process, to extract an archive and copy a subfolder of it in another directory. The archive path is given during the wizard by an user selection (I'll also implement it later).<br />
To extract the archive (that is a self-extracting archive) I run it with command line parameters, but the problem is to copy (and overwrite) a subfolder of it in a different directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AaronLS</div><div class="date">21st March 2009, 04:02</div></div><div class="posttext">So you've gotten as far as extracting the archive, if I understand correctly.  Now you want to take a subfolder from the extracted archive, and overwrite some other existing folder.<br />
<br />
Have you tried the CopyFiles command?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you need to, given your goals, but the existing folder that you are going to replace, could first be deleted/renamed before you copy over the new directory.  Depending on whether you want to merge/replace versus recreate.</div></div><hr />
