Listed under future enhancements is<br />
The text strings used in this page should be configurable, and should be i18n aware<br />
<br />
I wanted to i18n the strings, created LangStrings for all UI strings, placed the LangString lines at the end of the nsh, but they don't get read in.  The only way I could get this to work is to put the LangString lines at the end of my main nsi file.  What's the proper way to i18n a file that is meant to be included (and have that nsh file be all that's needed)?</div></div><hr />

When you use LangString you just have to use it after LoadLanguageFile (or in the case of MUI, !insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE). Therefore to keep them in the header file you will have to include the header file after the languages are defined.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oryan_dunn</div><div class="date">25th January 2011, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I get warnings on the LangString and about a language table.<br />
<br />
I tried moving the language declaration to before the include statement, but then I didn't have any strings at all (even the default ones included with nsis).  I wasn't sure if there was a way to make the header file self-contained.  Can I have the language declarations twice (just put one in the header file, and another in my main file)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afrow UK</div><div class="date">25th January 2011, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't say to move the language declarations. I said to move the !include. You have to have the language declarations after the page declarations.<br />

The gotcha in this case is that the header file declares a function for a custom page, so it would seem it would need to come before the page declarations.<br />
