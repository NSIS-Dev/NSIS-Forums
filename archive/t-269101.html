<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">helix400</div><div class="date">6th April 2007, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">My installer will be used by many different applications.  And I'd like to create a release folder that helps organize all the setup files.  For example:<br />
<br />
/Release/App1/Setup.exe<br />
/Release/App2/Setup.exe<br />
/Release/App3/Setup.exe<br />
<br />
But if an App folders doesn't exist, then I run into problems.  For example, the compile fails if I try something like:<br />
<br />
OutFile /Release/${App_Folder_Name}/Setup.exe<br />
<br />
And I assume it fails because OutFile doesn't create any missing folders, it just writes the file.  <br />
<br />
Is there a workaround solution?  I'd prefer to have the compiler create any missing output folders.</div></div><hr />

And worse, I just read that section an hour earlier while reading up on the !if statement.  And it didn't click with me.<br />
<br />
But I am happy that such a thing exists.  This will save me a ton of time...the NSIS installer has been a breath of fresh air after having to deal with MSI installer complexities.</div></div><hr />
