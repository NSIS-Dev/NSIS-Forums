<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avatar_888</div><div class="date">30th May 2004, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">i have an installer (http://www.ipodsoft.com/downloads/googleget/googleget_setup.exe) that runs perfectly on my system (and many others) but have had a report from one user of the following error message occuring as soon as the installer is executed:<br />
<br />
&quot;Error! Can't initialize plug-ins directory. Please try again later.&quot;<br />
<br />
we're both on exactly the same os (windows xp pro sp1) so that can't be particularly relevant. now i did search the forums and manage to find one other user (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=136943) reporting the same error message, however it was a really old message and kichik stated at the the end that that problem would be fixed soon.<br />
<br />
so, does this same problem still exist in the latest version of nsis (i'm using 2.0 final, not a cvs build though) and if so i just thought i should point it out. if not, then what's causing this problem and how can i get it fixed?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

The plug-ins directory is a temporary directory for the installer. There may be a problem with the drive that contains the Windows temp folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avatar_888</div><div class="date">30th May 2004, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">okay so is there something i can do to prevent this happening? or are you saying this user really is just a one-off case who needs to fix his machine?</div></div><hr />
