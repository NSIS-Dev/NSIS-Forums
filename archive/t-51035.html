<br />
I want to be able to do upgrades gracefully.  During the first installation, there are third party drivers I install that I do not want to install on upgrades.  Also, files may have been added or removed from the original installation which I would want to synchronize with every upgrade.  I have tried to use the existance if the registry key to trigger an uninstall, but for some reason it doesn't execute.  I can't think of any other way.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion or sample code would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<br />
well, i would do it like you described it.<br />
<br />
1. you could write something to the registry (WriteRegStr) during the first install, so you can check for existance (ReadRegStr) and don't have to install the drivers again.<br />
<br />
2. to check for files you could use the 'IfFileExists'<br />
command.<br />
<br />
i don't know why your registry routine didn't work, so maybe you should post some parts of your script.<br />

I see the log file showing the execution of the uninstall, but it never actually executes.<br />

<br />
that looks like it should work, but you could debug it a lil' more, so you have more chances to find the failure.<br />
<br />
try it like that:<br />
<br />
ClearErrors <br />
ReadRegStr $1 HKLM &quot;SOFTWARE\Cavio Corporation\Cavio&quot; &quot;&quot; <br />
IfErrors lbl_nouninstall <br />
<br />
ReadRegStr $1 HKLM &quot;Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Cavio&quot; &quot;UninstallString&quot; <br />
IfErrors lbl_nouninstall <br />
<br />
ExecWait &quot;$1&quot; ; &lt;-- maybe you should replace &quot;&quot; with ''<br />
; i don't know what happens<br />
; when $1 returns this: &quot;&quot;longpathname/filename.exe&quot; /param&quot;<br />
; so maybe: '&quot;longpathname/filename.exe&quot; /param' would work<br />
; better<br />
IfErrors lbl_error lbl_nouninstall<br />
<br />
lbl_error:<br />
MessageBox MB_OK 'Error: $1' ; only for debuging<br />
<br />
lbl_nouninstall: <br />
<br />

<br />
For some reason, I had to issue a &quot;SetOutPath &quot;$INSTDIR&quot;&quot; before the &quot;ExecWait...&quot;.  Now, the problem I am having is that it is not waiting for the uninstall to complete.  As if I were using just &quot;Exec&quot; instead of &quot;ExecWait&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Is anyone trying to do the same thing?<br />
