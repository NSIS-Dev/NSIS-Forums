<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crayon2000</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, my question is about this code taken from makensis.nsi in the repository (http://sourceforge.net/p/nsis/code/HEAD/tree/NSIS/trunk/Examples/makensis.nsi):<br />
    ClearErrors<br />
    ExecWait '$R1 _?=$INSTDIR'<br />
<br />
    BringToFront<br />
<br />
    IfErrors no_remove_uninstaller<br />
    IfFileExists &quot;$INSTDIR\Bin\makensis.exe&quot; no_remove_uninstaller<br />
<br />
      Delete $R1<br />
      RMDir $INSTDIR<br />
      StrCpy $R1 &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
    no_remove_uninstaller:<br />
<br />
    StrCmp &quot;&quot; $R1 0 +3<br />
      MessageBox MB_ICONEXCLAMATION &quot;Unable to uninstall!&quot;<br />
      Abort<br />
This code is causing a problem when NSIS is already installed and the installer is executed again. If the user decides to Uninstall from the uninstaller, the _?=$INSTDIR command line option will generate an error. So IfErrors will always go to no_remove_uninstaller and the &quot;Unable to uninstall!&quot; message will appear.<br />
<br />
With nsis-3.0a0-setup.exe I'm always getting this error. I'm using Windows XP.</div></div><hr />

Hi Anders, I think with the changes done, when the uninstallation is completed and successful ($0 == 0) the Installer will not be close. Is that the wanted behavior? Because this is not how it works in version 2.46.<br />
<br />

OK, I'll post there for any new issues related to the alpha release.</div></div><hr />

If the version is the same it should quit, if different it should not IIRC</div></div><hr />

Hi, if I understand correctly :rolleyes: This code is only called when every thing worked well during the uninstallation of the software:<br />
      StrCpy $0 $R1 1<br />
      ${IfThen} $0 == '&quot;' ${|} StrCpy $R1 $R1 -1 1 ${|} ; Strip quotes from UninstallString<br />
      Delete $R1<br />
      RMDir $INSTDIR<br />
It means that this will never be called:<br />
        StrCmp $R0 &quot;2&quot; 0 +2 ; Is the existing install the same version?<br />
          Quit ; ...yes, already installed, we are done<br />
So I think it is never quitting the Installer when the version is the same.<br />
<br />
It's hard to test on my side because I don't have all the required software to compile NSIS. So compiling makensis.nsi will failed because of the missing files.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure you are right.<br />
<br />
So if you use the code from the repository and you do the following steps:<br />
<br />
 Install NSIS 3.0a0 normally<br />
 Run the Installer again, you should have the Already Installed page now<br />
 Choose Uninstall NSIS<br />
 Do the uninstallation steps and click on Close at the end<br />
 At this point the Installer should be closed? I don't think that's what is happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can't test it, I'll be waiting for version 3.0a1.<br />
<br />
Thank you for trying to help me. I know I'm not always clear :D</div></div><hr />
