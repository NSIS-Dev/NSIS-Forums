First of all...sorry for my very bad english...<br />
<br />
I have a pb with my uninstaller.<br />
For my software, I need to create a new user named &quot;demo&quot;.<br />
So, I want to delete it when I uninstall my soft.<br />
I manage to do that but I'd like to delete his personal folder (documents and settings\demo)too.<br />
But when I do that (thanks rmdir /R), it give me an error and the folder is not erased...<br />
How can I do this ?<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RmDir /r /rebootok<br />
<br />
This will delete it on reboot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chrysalide</div><div class="date">4th July 2005, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already try to do that but without success...<br />
<br />
However, I can delete this folder manually, without pb.<br />
<br />
Have somebody another idea ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comperio</div><div class="date">5th July 2005, 06:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure that the folder you are trying to delete IS NOT the  working directory.  (You cannot delete the working directory.)  Do this by using SetOutPath to set to a different working directory first.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
SetOutPath &quot;C:\foo&quot;<br />
RMDir /r &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\demo&quot;</div></div><hr />

Arg...<br />
Somebody has another idea to help me...please ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for those answers !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chrysalide</div><div class="date">6th July 2005, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it's not deleted even after reboot.<br />
For the moment, I've found another solution, but it's a little &quot;violent&quot; :<br />
<br />
<br />
nsExec::Exec 'cmd /C rmdir &quot;c:\documents and settings\demo&quot; /S /Q'<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you another better idea ?<br />
Thanks a lot for all your answers !</div></div><hr />
