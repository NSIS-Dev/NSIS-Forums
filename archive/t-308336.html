<br />
I am using a 3rd party package (Adobe Flash Player 10 ActiveX). When installing this package (standalone EXE) then everything is working fine.<br />
But when installing it with /S silent parameter then the installer let some temp files (Au_.exe and NSISArray.dll) and writes the entries into PEndingFileRenameOperations.<br />
<br />
I think this isn't nessesary, because when installing non silent all files are cleaned correctly.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have some ideas?<br />
<br />

It must have uninstalled the old version. NSISArray.dll being left over suggests it wasn't used properly and wasn't unloaded after being used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your answer. <br />
This happens on a clean windows system where the product was never installed.<br />
Are there any options without &quot;touching&quot; the installer. And why is this problem only when installing in silent mode?<br />
<br />

How can i look into the installer?<br />
I think it is a compiled package.<br />
