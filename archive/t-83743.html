<br />
I am trying to get a log file written of everything that happens during an install.  I understood that I could recompile the source with the definition of NSIS_CONFIG_LOG uncommentted in config.h to accomplish this.  I recompiled the source and the new version of makensis that I created doesn't seem to be creating a log file. I was expecting to get a file &quot;install.log&quot; with a list of everything installed (i.e. the &quot;detail&quot;), but I could not find the file anywhere. Is there anything else about NSIS_CONFIG_LOG that I need to know? <br />
 <br />
Thanks for any pointers,<br />
Beth</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know NSIS_CONFIG_LOG only enables you to use SilentInstall silentlog.<br />
When you compile a script with the above directive but NSIS_CONFIG_LOG is not enabled then you get this error:<br />
SilentInstall: silentlog specified, no log support compiled in (use NSIS_CONFIG_LOG)<br />
<br />
You can check the source code if you want and search for #ifdef NSIS_CONFIG_LOG or #if defined(NSIS_CONFIG_LOG and see what it enables.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbh</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 22:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on a previous discussion, I thought the purpose of NSIS_CONFIG_LOG was to capture the details of an install to a log file.<br />
&quot;You can also uncomment NSIS_CONFIG_LOG in config.h to enable logging to install.log in the installer directory.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've tried a silent install with the plain vanilla version of nsis (that I believe does not have NSIS_CONFIG_LOG defined) and it works just fine, without the error you specify.  This is with v1.96.<br />
<br />
I have looked at the code a bit, and it there seems to be quite a bit involved with the preprocessor definition for NSIS_CONFIG_LOG.  So I haven't taken the time to figure out exactly what it is doing.  I was hoping that at least someone familiar with the code could verify that the definition of NSIS_CONFIG_LOG would indeed create a file called install.log.<br />
<br />
Searching the forum has not yielded any help- in fact searching on NSIS_CONFIG_LOG does not find anything- even my own messages.  I did find another question from someone else trying to do the exact same thing and unfortunately they got no replies.  So either I have a big misunderstanding on how this is supposed to work or what else I have to do to get it to work, or this flag doesn't quite do what it is advertised to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But did it give you a log file?<br />
I think you used SilentInstall silent instead of SilentInstall silentlog...<br />
<br />
I think the best thing to do is to dig into the code... I have never used the logging facility so I am not quite familiar with it... Sorry.<br />
